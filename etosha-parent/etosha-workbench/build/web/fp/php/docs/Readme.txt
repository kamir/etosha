This directory is to be used as an output directory for published document. 

For the publishing to work, this directory needs to have write permissions for the web user. 
On Windows based systems, this can be done by letting the executing account has write permissions 
to the folder (or by letting the "Users" group has write permission to the folder). 
Linux users accomplish the same setting by executing chmod 777 on this folder.

This directory and the pdf directory do not need to reside inside the web root and a good idea is
to place them somewhere else if you want to stay in control of how your documents are read.
