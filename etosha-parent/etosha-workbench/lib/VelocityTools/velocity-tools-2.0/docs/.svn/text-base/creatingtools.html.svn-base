            This page contains advice and instructions for
            creating your own "tools".  Of course, almost any POJO can
            be used as a tool, but there are ways to make your tools
            much more useful, maintainable and secure.  The tips here
            should help you do that. If you have tips to add,
            email them to our

      <p>
        Any class you wish to use as a tool must be declared public
        and have a public, no-argument constructor.
        </p>

<div class="section"><a name="Conventions"><h2>Conventions</h2></a>
  <div class="subsection"><h3><a name="Tool_Keys/Names" class="nolink">Tool Keys/Names</a></h3>
        <p>
            As of VelocityTools 2, the toolbox support can now
            automatically determine the key name for a tool from
            its classname.  So, a tool named org.com.FooTool would
            be assigned the key $foo in your templates, tool
            named org.com.FooBarTool would be $fooBar, and a tool
            named org.com.FooBar would be also be $fooBar.
            </p>
    <p>
            If you would prefer to give your org.com.FooBar tool
            the key $foob, you can use the 
            <code>org.apache.velocity.tools.config.DefaultKey</code>
            annotation like this:
            </p>
<div class="source">
  <pre><sourcecode>
package org.com;

import org.apache.velocity.tools.config.DefaultKey;

@DefaultKey("foob")
public class FooBar {
    ...
}
</sourcecode></pre>
</div>
    <p>
            Of course, you or your tool users can always override 
            your intended key by specifying a different one in
            the configuration.  Configured key values take precedence
            over @DefaultKey annotations, and the annotations take
            precedence over the tool's class name.
            </p>

</div>
<div class="subsection"><h3><a name="Tool_Properties" class="nolink">Tool Properties</a></h3>
        <p>
            If you want to allow your tool to be configured, you have two
            options: 
            <ul>
            <li>add a public setter for each property</li>
            <li>add a <code>public void configure(Map props)</code> method</li>
            </ul>
            You can, of course, do both, but if you do so keep in mind
            that the specific setters will be called before the configure()
            method.
            The application of configuration properties to specific setters
            is done using
            <code>org.apache.commons.beanutils.PropertyUtils</code> from
            the Commons-BeanUtils project, so the rules follow the typical
            bean property conventions.
            </p>
    <p>
            One thing to consider here is the scope of your tool and
            whether or not you want the template authors to be able to
            alter tool settings from within the template.  Remember,
            templates can call any public method on any public class,
            so your specific property setters will be accesible.
            This is almost always a bad thing for application or session
            scoped tools as it would make the tool non-threadsafe, 
            and may or may not matter for a request
            scoped tool depending on how you use it.  If you cannot rely
            on your template authors to avoid using those setters or just want
            to make sure nothing can be changed from within the template,
            you will probably want to use the configure() method and have
            your tool extend SafeConfig or one of its subclasses.
            (This is discussed more later.)

</div>
<div class="section"><a name="Annotations"><h2>Annotations</h2></a>
      <p>
        There are three Annotations provided for tool authors:
        <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/config/DefaultKey.html">DefaultKey</a>,
        <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/config/InvalidScope.html">InvalidScope</a> and
        <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/config/ValidScope.html">ValidScope</a>
        </p>
    <p>
        As described above, the @DefaultKey annotation is used to specify
        a default key for your tool.  The @InvalidScope and @ValidScope annotations
        allow you to restrict the 
        <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/Scope.html">Scope</a>(s)
        in which the tool can be used in either negative or positive terms.
        When described positively using the @ValidScope annotation, the
        tool may <strong>only</strong> be used in a toolbox with the specified
        scope. If placed in any other toolbox, an 
        <code>org.apache.velocity.tools.config.InvalidScopeException</code>
        will be thrown.  Using @InvalidScope, on the other hand, allows you
        reject specific scope(s), whilst implicitly allowing any others.
        </p>
    <p>
        Here's a scope annotation example:
        </p>
<div class="source">
  <pre><sourcecode>
@InvalidScope({Scope.APPLICATION,Scope.SESSION})
public class PagerTool

<div class="section"><a name="Designing_Template-Friendly_Interfaces"><h2>Designing Template-Friendly Interfaces</h2></a>
      <p>
        Following a few best-practices can make your tools
        much more elegant and friendly to template authors.
        <ul>
        <li><a href="#Be_Robust">Be robust.</a> Catch exceptions and return <code>null</code> on errors.</li>
        <li><a href="#Be_Flexible">Be flexible.</a> Have methods accept <code>Object</code> when possible.</li>
        <li><a href="#Be_Careful">Be careful.</a> Choose scope carefully and be aware of thread safety issues.</li>
        <li><a href="#Be_Fluent">Be fluent.</a> Subtools or <code>get(key)</code> methods can make a clear and flexible API.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
<div class="subsection"><h3><a name="Be_Robust" class="nolink">Be Robust</a></h3>
        <p>
            Always return null on errors! No Exceptions!
            Ok, maybe there are some exceptions if you are sure that's what
            you want your tool to do.  Just be aware that this will likely surprise
            the user because uncaught exceptions halt template processing at
            the point the exception is thrown.  If the output of the template
            is not buffered, this will result in an awkward, partial rendering.
            So, if you are going to let an exception through, make sure it
            is worth halting everything for.  Often it is sufficient to 
            return null, thus allowing
            the failed reference to appear in the output like this:
            </p>
<div class="source">
  <pre><sourcecode>$mytool.somemethod('bad input')</sourcecode></pre>
</div>
    <p>
            This, of course, assumes that quiet notation is not being used
            for that reference.  For this reason, it may be prudent to give
            your tool access to a logging facility in order to log exceptions
            and make sure important errors are not silently swallowed.
            Standard tool management for VelocityTools (even just GenericTools)
            makes the result of <code>velocityEngine.getLog()</code> available
            to tools as a property under the key "log".  So log access can be
            added as simply as adding a
            <code>public void setLog(org.apache.velocity.runtime.log.Log log)</code>
            method and utilizing the provided Log instance.
            </p>
    <p>
            If you wish to toggle the exception catching or, more importantly,
            if you prefer to catch exceptions globally with a Velocity Event Handler,
            then have your tool watch for the "catchExceptions" property.  This
            is <code>false</code> by default, but if the VelocityEngine has a 
            MethodExceptionEventHandler configured, then it will be automatically
            set to <code>true</code>.  Again, just add a 
            <code>public void setCatchExceptions(boolean catch)</code> method to your
            tool or watch for the "catchExceptions" property in your
            <code>public void configure(Map props)</code> method.  See 
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/RenderTool.html">RenderTool</a>
            for an example of this.

            Variables in templates are strongly, but dynamically typed.  As the
            current type (or whole subject of typing) is often not transparently
            obvious to the person working on the template, it is best to accept
            <code>Object</code> for most method parameters and handle any necessary
            conversions in your tool (either through overloading or actual conversion).
            This way template authors and maintainers don't have to worry about the
            variable being passed to tool methods.
            </p>
    <p>
            Of course, there may be times when you wish to restrict what a method
            can accept or when a method is public for use by other classes, not templates.
            If the method is not meant to be used by the template, ignore this advice
            and pay careful attention to the <a href="#Be_Careful">advice below</a>.
            If you have other reasons for restricting the types accepted by a method
            that you do intend to be used, just be sure to document this plainly so it
            is easy to discover why the method isn't being called and what parameters
            it expects to receive.
            </p>

</div>
<div class="subsection"><h3><a name="Be_Careful" class="nolink">Be Careful</a></h3>
        <p>
            The first thing to remember is that all public methods declared
            in public classes may be called from templates.  If it is imperative
            that a method not be called from a template, you must either change
            its permissions, its class's permissions or else put some sort of
            guard into the implementation of the method that renders it harmless
            when used by a template.  See the implementation of <code>configure(Map)</code>
            in <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/SafeConfig.html">SafeConfig</a>
            for an example of the latter option.
            </p>
    <p>
            The second thing to think about is thread-safety.  If your tool
            maintains internal state that is in any way changed by the calling
            of its public methods, then your tool is not thread safe.  The
            only thread-safe tools are those that maintain no state or are
            otherwise immutable (e.g. return new, copied instances w/changed state 
            and leave original unchanged).  If your tool is not thread-safe,
            you should seriously consider <a href="#Annotations">using a
            scope-limiting annotation</a> to prevent such problems.
            </p>
    <p>
            Thread-safety is, of course, most important if your tool is meant to
            be used in "application" or "session" scoped toolboxes for web
            applications or any other multi-threaded application.  Allowing
            access to non-thread-safe tools in those scopes can lead to 
            all sorts of unpleasant problems. Please note that sometimes
            request scope isn't safe either! if you #parse subtemplates
            or are otherwise composing your page of separate pieces (e.g. Tiles)
            that may not know what each other are doing at any one time.
            </p>
    <p>
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/SafeConfig.html">SafeConfig</a>
            and its subclasses can help you have safely configurable tools
            in any scope.  They do this by only allowing the public
            <code>configure(Map)</code> method to be called once.  All other
            configuration methods should then be declared protected and the
            tool cannot be re-configured by a template.  This technique may,
            in the future, be changed to allow you to replace the configure(Map) method
            with a constructor that takes a Map of configuration properties,
            but for various reasons, this is not currently the case.
            </p>
    <p>
            As a final note here, if you really have good reason to use a
            mutable, non-thread-safe application or
            session scoped tool, tool path restrictions can help you limit
            possible damage here.  Of course, this is something done purely at
            the <a href="config.html">configuration</a> level and cannot
            be currently defined by the tool itself.

<div class="subsection"><h3><a name="Be_Fluent" class="nolink">Be Fluent</a></h3>
        <p>
            When writing tools, you should take care in how you design its methods
            to make the resulting syntax in the templates clear, succinct and simple
            and thus decrease typos and "visual clutter".  Readability is important for
            maintainability and things can get ugly and unreadable fast if you aren't
            careful.  Typical Java method naming tends to be fairly verbose, which
            works fine in Java development environment with auto-complete and Java
            conventions to respect.  It wouldn't be out of line for a BubbleGum class to
            have a method <code>getStickWithName(String name)</code>,
            but using that in a template (e.g. 
            <code>$bubbleGum.getStickWithName('bigred')</code>) is not ideal.
            It would be much better to have a simple <code>get(String name)</code>
            method to simplify that down to just <code>$bubbleGum.bigred</code>.
            </p>
    <p>
            One of your best assets when trying to simplify your tools' template-facing
            interface is the fact that Velocity includes <code>get('name')</code> in
            the method lookup for <code>$tool.name</code>.  For some tools, this can
            greatly simplify the syntax, as shown above.  Also, by encouraging the
            use of such short syntax, you give yourself greater flexibility in making
            changes to the tool later, which you would not have if the template
            references were all explicit method calls like <code>$tool.getName()</code>.
            </p>
    <p>
            Another handy technique available to tool author's like yourself is
            the use of what we call subtools.  These are examples of the
            <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">fluent
            interface pattern</a>.  Essentially, the idea is that most methods
            return either the tool itself again, or else another object that has
            a similar or otherwise naturally subsequent interface.
            Such "fluent" interfaces tend to be very natural, clear and succinct,
            both saving keystrokes and keeping templates easy to read and maintain.
            </p>
    <p>
            In VelocityTools' standard set of tools, this practice is put
            into place often and in a few different ways.
            Here's a few examples, out of the many tools which make good
            use of fluent interfaces and a <code>get(key)</code> method.
            <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/ResourceTool.html">ResourceTool</a>
                uses subtools to allow you to type <code>$text.org.com.Foo</code> instead of
                <code>$text.get('org.com.Foo')</code> or worse, something very java-ish like
                <code>$text.getResourceFromBundle('messages.properties', 'org.com.Foo')</code>.
                This is achieved by having the get() method return a new instance of its 
                <code>Key</code> subclass that carries with it the value to be gotten.
                The Key, in turn, has a get() method that does the same (and more),
                returning a new Key instance that carries the concatenated values of
                both get() calls.  And so on it goes, until the final resulting value
                is rendered by Velocity calling the last Key's toString() method.
                <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/view/LinkTool.html">LinkTool</a>
                takes a different approach.  Rather than use a subclass as the subtool, it
                uses itself.  Almost every method in LinkTool returns a copy of the
                original instance with the addition of the latest value.  Both this
                approach and that of ResourceTool provide great flexibility to
                the template author.  They can use the tools however they wish,
                with no concerns about thread collisions, shared state or lifecycle.
                And with modern JVMs, the performance cost of this flexibility
                is minimal--light object creation and reflection have become cheap and fast,
                and short-lived instances like those created in the process are
                quickly garbage collected.
                <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/ClassTool.html">ClassTool</a>
                uses subtools to a somewhat different end.  Rather than simply replicating
                the interface of the parent, the subtools provide a natural interface wrapping
                around the result of the previous call.  This is done because the reflection
                API provided by JavaSE is not at all template-friendly.  ClassTool wraps
                almost all returned methods, contructors and fields with subtools that
                continue to provide a natural, template-friendly interface.
                <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/AlternatorTool.html">AlternatorTool</a>
                falls into a very simple class of "subtool" uses.  In this case,
                the AlternatorTool class serves only as a factory for creating
                instances of the separate Alternator class.  In this case,
                the so-called "subtool" is really the main thing and the tool
                exists solely to provide access to it.
                <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/LoopTool.html">LoopTool</a>
                might be the strangest of them all.  It is unlikely that you
                would find need to create such a tool, but if you are curious,
                read on.  LoopTool exists to add value and convenience to using
                the #foreach directive.  The methods on the main class are either
                used when starting a #foreach loop or else for use during said loop.
                The starting ones return a "subtool" of sorts called
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/LoopTool.ManagedIterator.html">ManagedIterator</a>,
                which provides a few fluent methods for refinement of the loop
                control.  The final result of those, however, is largely just
                used by #foreach internally.  While the loop is going, however,
                the original LoopTool itself may be directly used to observe
                and/or influence the ManagedIterator being used internally by
                #foreach.  This is because the main LoopTool keeps track of
                all its subtool instances in a Stack.  This is very different
                from most subtool situations, where the tool and subtool are
                immediately disassociated.
