/**
 * We use this tool to run a single FUSEKI-Server, in standalone or
 * simple scale out mode, for high throughput SPARQL queries. 
 * 
 * We offer an "embedded" single node FUSEKI service by running a CSD in CM.
 * 
 * The cluster mode is based on a YARN application, which starts multiple 
 * FUSEKI instances, a loadbalancer, and offers automatic scale out if query
 * number is to high.
 * 
 * This scale-out cluster is managed by a FUSEKI MASTER service.
 *
 * This tool exposes a set of TTL files via Fuseki. A graph can be prepared
 * as a set of partitions, each partition stored in an TTL file. The FUSEKI
 * server load the ttl files from a local folder.
 * 
 * Distribution of the the graph is done via HDFS. As soon as a FUSEKI node
 * takes over the control on such a partition it provides METADATA in ZOOKEEPER.
 * 
 * This way, zookeeper knows which partition is available on which SERVER AND 
 * PORT. Partitions can be seen as named graphs, even if the graph name is not
 * explicitely part of the ttl file. This way we automatically enrich all 
 * triples in a partition by a thorth triple, which is only known on the 
 * meta-layer (in the master and in the zookeeper).
 * 
 * We can run multiple local graph partitions on on physical / virtual host.
 * ZOOKEEPER holds the partition registry.
 *
 * A TripleStoreRunner uses generated data to expose it via SPARQL End-Point.
 *
 * Creation of such graphs is done via Contextualizer tools. E.g., the 
 * DEFAULT-JENA-IN-RAM contextualizer is used to triplify groups of emails. 
 * 
 * Flume will use the GRAPH-PARTITIONER-SINK to write ttl files into HDFS.
