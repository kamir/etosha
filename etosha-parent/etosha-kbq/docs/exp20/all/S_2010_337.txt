Letter dated 25 June 2010 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council
I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1896 (2009) of 30 November 2009 concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Council requested me to extend, for a period expiring on 30 November 2010, the Group of Experts established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004). Accordingly, I wish to inform you that, after consulting with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I have appointed Mr. Steven Hege, United States of America (armed groups), to replace Mr. Philip Lancaster, Canada (armed groups), who resigned from the Group. I have also selected Mr. Mouctar Kokouma Diallo, Guinea (customs and finance), to replace Mr. Lancaster as Coordinator of the Group of Experts. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council.
