The members of the Security Council stressed that fighting impunity is an integral part of the much-needed comprehensive reform of the security sector.  They welcomed recent steps taken by Congolese authorities to address the issue of impunity within the national security forces, including the announcement on 5 July 2009 of a “zero-tolerance policy” against criminal acts and misconduct in the armed forces.  They encouraged Congolese authorities to continue taking further affirmative steps in this regard and also reiterated their call upon Congolese authorities to establish an effective vetting mechanism within the national security forces.  The members of the Council undertook to continue to monitor progress in this regard and requested the Secretary-General to keep the Council informed of further developments.
