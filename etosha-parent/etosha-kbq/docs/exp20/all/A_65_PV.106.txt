Reports of the Fifth Committee
The President (spoke in French): The General Assembly will now consider the reports of the Fifth Committee under agenda items 127, 129, 143 to 148 and 150 to 160. The Assembly also has before it the report of the Committee on sub-item (a) of agenda item 113. I request the Rapporteur of the Fifth Committee, Ms. Nicole Mannion of Ireland, to introduce the reports of the Fifth Committee in one intervention. Ms. Mannion (Ireland), Rapporteur of the Fifth Committee: I have the honour today to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Fifth Committee containing recommendations on issues that required action during the second part of the resumed sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. In the course of the second part of the resumed session, which took place between 2 and 27 May and on 30 June, the Fifth Committee held 10 formal meetings, as well as numerous informal meetings and informal consultations. In accordance with resolution 49/233, of 23 December 1994, the second part of the resumed session of the Fifth Committee was devoted primarily to considering the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping missions and associated peacekeeping issues. The Committee considered the financing of 16 peacekeeping missions, as well as other related peacekeeping items and issues.
In addition, the Committee resumed its consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 113, entitled “Appointment of members of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions”. On this agenda item, in paragraph 3 of its report contained in document A/65/562/Add.1, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it appoint David Traystman of the United States of America as a member of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions for a term of office beginning on 23 July and ending 31 December 2011. The Committee made that recommendation by acclamation. On agenda item 127, entitled “Financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors”, in paragraph 6 of its report contained in document A/65/594/Add.1, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which the Committee adopted without a vote. On agenda item 129, entitled “Programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011”, in paragraph 6 of its report contained in document A/65/646/Add.3, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which the Committee adopted without a vote. On agenda item 143, entitled “Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations”, in paragraph 15 of its report contained in document A/65/890, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the

adoption of the following five draft resolutions: draft resolution I, entitled “Cross-cutting issues”; draft resolution II, entitled “Strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations”; draft resolution III, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy”; draft resolution IV, entitled “Reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment”; and draft resolution V, entitled “Closed peacekeeping missions”. The Committee adopted all those draft resolutions without a vote. With regard to the draft resolutions on the financing of peacekeeping operations, I would like to inform the General Assembly that, with the exception of sub-item (b) of agenda item 156, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon”, the Committee adopted all the draft proposals without a vote.

The Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, as orally amended, which the Committee adopted without a vote. Before I conclude, allow me again to thank delegations for their cooperation in the conduct of negotiations. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Fifth Committee, Ambassador Gert Rosenthal, for the way in which he guided us through our difficult work, as well as the members of the Bureau, with whom it was, as always, a pleasure to work. On behalf of all of us, I would like to express our profound thanks to the representatives of the Secretariat for their cooperation, patience and support, and to the secretariat of the Fifth Committee.

The President (spoke in French): Before we proceed, I would like to point out the fact that, since the Fifth Committee has just completed its work, the reports are available only in English. They will be published in all the official languages of the United Nations as soon as possible. I thank participants for their understanding. If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Fifth Committee that are before the Assembly today. It was so decided. The President (spoke in French): I give the floor to the representative of France on a point of order. Mr. Allo (France) (spoke in French): I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having given me the floor to make a customary statement at the stage in the meeting in which we adopt draft resolutions. First of all, I would very much like to thank the various services for the manner in which they have produced the necessary documents in a very short period of time. However, I regret that the French version of the documents is not available. I would therefore like to recall that the official versions of documents to be adopted in the General Assembly must be made available in the six official languages of the United Nations prior to their formal adoption by the Assembly. I trust that this will be done in the future. In the immediate term, my delegation will not be opposed to their adoption at this meeting. The President (spoke in French): I take note of that statement. Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote. The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records. May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that: “When the same draft resolution is considered in
a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in
plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee”.
May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats. Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance. That means that, where recorded or separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Fifth Committee. In recent days, I have actively consulted all groups and many members on many occasions, in order to find a solution that is satisfactory to all parties while avoiding a vote in keeping with the tradition concerning budgetary matters. I am satisfied that the solution that we have found with the groups has been endorsed by the Fifth Committee. It is this solution that we will consider now in plenary meeting.

In order for the Assembly to consider the report of the Fifth Committee under sub-item (a) of agenda item 113, it will be necessary to reopen consideration of the sub-item. May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to reopen consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 113 and proceed immediately to its consideration? It was so decided.

The President (spoke in French): I shall now give the floor to the representatives who wish to speak in explanation of vote or position on the resolutions and decisions just adopted. Mr. Ayzouki (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation joined the consensus on the adoption of resolution 65/302, on the financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, and
A/65/PV.106
9 11-39617
voted in favour of resolution 65/303, on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. My delegation would like to reiterate that the responsibility for financing these two missions should be borne by Israel, the occupier and party responsible for the aggression that led to their establishment in the first place. Our position is based on our consistent support for the principles underpinning resolution 1874 (S-IV), of 27 June 1963. Mr. Ronaghan (United States of America): The United States strongly supports the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which is implementing an important mandate. However, the use of General Assembly funding resolutions to pursue claims against a Member State procedurally is not correct. That is the reason that we have opposed the General Assembly resolutions on this item in previous years, since they require Israel to pay for the costs stemming from the Qana incident of 1996. Those resolutions were not consensus resolutions. Since shortly after the inception of the United Nations, the procedure that has been followed is that the Secretary-General presents and pursues a settlement of the Organization’s claims against a State or States. Using a funding resolution to legislate a settlement is inappropriate. It also politicizes the work of the Fifth Committee and should be avoided both now and in the future. Mr. Lafortune (Canada): Today, Canada found it necessary to oppose resolution 65/303, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon”. That should in no way be construed as a lack of confidence in or support for the work of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Canada has supported and continues to support the valuable work of UNIFIL. However, the resolution contains language that calls on Israel to provide compensation to the United Nations for the 1996 Qana incident. Canada found certain paragraphs of the resolution to be inappropriate, as they were an attempt to politicize the important work of the Fifth Committee. Moreover, those paragraphs were once against introduced into the resolution despite the serious reservations regarding them expressed by Canada and other delegations in previous years. Therefore, Canada cannot endorse the proposed approach to dealing with the issue of compensation and believes that it weakens the
resolution overall and draws attention from its principal purpose, which is to support the very useful work that UNIFIL has undertaken. Mr. Yanouka (Israel): First, I wish to express once again Israel’s thanks and support for United Nations peacekeeping forces, including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We express our gratitude to the troop-contributing countries, to the commanders and all those who support the important work of the diverse peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. Israel’s political and financial contributions represent our continuing commitment to the operations, goals and values of peacekeeping operations. We are proud to have good relations and long-standing cooperation with peacekeeping forces in our region. Notwithstanding what I have just said, I am compelled to express Israel’s disappointment with resolution 65/303, which contains specific language that is politicized and genuinely unhelpful as regards support for peacekeeping operations. Despite the professional nature of the Fifth Committee, preambular paragraph 4 and operative paragraphs 4, 5 and 15 are an attempt to institutionalize an anti-Israel narrative within the United Nations. For those reasons, my delegation called for a vote on the resolution and voted against it. Mr. Khachab (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First of all, I would like to thank all the friendly States that voted in favour of financing for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), especially the Group of 77 and China, the members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States. We would also like to thank UNIFIL for the role it has played since 1972. We attach great value to the enormous sacrifices made by the mission, including the hundreds who have died. We also wish to express our appreciation for the excellent relations between UNIFIL and Lebanese forces, as well as to thank all troop-contributing countries. With respect to the substance of resolution 65/303, we believe that the principle of collective responsibility for the financing of peacekeeping operations does not contradict the individual responsibility of States when they violate international law or their responsibility for the consequences of such

acts. That includes reparations when a State is responsible for the damage it has caused, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 1 of resolution 55/235, on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping forces. I would like to remind the Assembly of the contents of the resolution that the Fifth Committee voted in favour of and which was just adopted by the General Assembly. Israel has not implemented the 18 General Assembly resolutions that require it to pay reparations following the shelling of Qana in 1996. This affected international forces. Approximately 100 civilians were killed, mainly children and elderly persons, and there were hundreds of injured. We must also recall that Israel owes over $1 million in reparations for material damage due to the bombing of the UNIFIL compound, as described in the report of the Secretary-General dated 7 May 1996 and contained in document S/1996/337. The Fifth Committee therefore has a duty to consider this issue. Finally, Israel must pay what it owes, even if that is incomplete in the light of the bombings of the schools of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East schools in 2003 and 2009. The President (spoke in French): The General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 156.

Reports of the Fifth Committee
The President (spoke in French): The General Assembly will now consider the reports of the Fifth Committee under agenda items 127, 129, 143 to 148 and 150 to 160. The Assembly also has before it the report of the Committee on sub-item (a) of agenda item 113. I request the Rapporteur of the Fifth Committee, Ms. Nicole Mannion of Ireland, to introduce the reports of the Fifth Committee in one intervention. Ms. Mannion (Ireland), Rapporteur of the Fifth Committee: I have the honour today to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Fifth Committee containing recommendations on issues that required action during the second part of the resumed sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. In the course of the second part of the resumed session, which took place between 2 and 27 May and on 30 June, the Fifth Committee held 10 formal meetings, as well as numerous informal meetings and informal consultations. In accordance with resolution 49/233, of 23 December 1994, the second part of the resumed session of the Fifth Committee was devoted primarily to considering the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping missions and associated peacekeeping issues. The Committee considered the financing of 16 peacekeeping missions, as well as other related peacekeeping items and issues.
In addition, the Committee resumed its consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 113, entitled “Appointment of members of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions”. On this agenda item, in paragraph 3 of its report contained in document A/65/562/Add.1, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it appoint David Traystman of the United States of America as a member of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions for a term of office beginning on 23 July and ending 31 December 2011. The Committee made that recommendation by acclamation. On agenda item 127, entitled “Financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors”, in paragraph 6 of its report contained in document A/65/594/Add.1, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which the Committee adopted without a vote. On agenda item 129, entitled “Programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011”, in paragraph 6 of its report contained in document A/65/646/Add.3, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which the Committee adopted without a vote. On agenda item 143, entitled “Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations”, in paragraph 15 of its report contained in document A/65/890, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the

adoption of the following five draft resolutions: draft resolution I, entitled “Cross-cutting issues”; draft resolution II, entitled “Strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations”; draft resolution III, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy”; draft resolution IV, entitled “Reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment”; and draft resolution V, entitled “Closed peacekeeping missions”. The Committee adopted all those draft resolutions without a vote. With regard to the draft resolutions on the financing of peacekeeping operations, I would like to inform the General Assembly that, with the exception of sub-item (b) of agenda item 156, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon”, the Committee adopted all the draft proposals without a vote. The reports of the Fifth Committee are presented under the following agenda items: 144, “Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad”, which is contained in document A/65/653/Add.1; 145, “Financing of the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire”, which is contained in document A/65/881; 146, “Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus”, which is contained in document A/65/882; 147 to 148, “Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo” and “Financing of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo”, respectively, which is contained in document A/65/654/Add.1; 150, “Financing of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste”, which is contained in document A/65/883; 151, “Financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea”, which is contained in document A/65/878; 152, “Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia”, which is contained in document A/65/879; 153, “Financing of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti”, which is contained in document A/65/655/Add.1; 154, “Financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo”, which is contained in document A/65/884; 155, “Financing of the United Nations Mission in Liberia”, which is contained in document A/65/885; sub-item (a) of agenda item 156, “United Nations Disengagement

With regard to sub-item (b) of agenda item 156, entitled “United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon”, the report of the Fifth Committee is contained in document A/65/880. The Committee considered the draft resolution, as amended, and decided to retain the fourth preambular paragraph and existing operative paragraphs 4, 5 and 15 by a single recorded vote of 71 in favour, 3 against and 51 abstentions. In paragraph 10 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft resolution, as amended, as a whole, which the Committee adopted by a recorded vote of 121 in favour, 3 against and 1 abstention.

The Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, as orally amended, which the Committee adopted without a vote. Before I conclude, allow me again to thank delegations for their cooperation in the conduct of negotiations. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Fifth Committee, Ambassador Gert Rosenthal, for the way in which he guided us through our difficult work, as well as the members of the Bureau, with whom it was, as always, a pleasure to work. On behalf of all of us, I would like to express our profound thanks to the representatives of the Secretariat for their cooperation, patience and support, and to the secretariat of the Fifth Committee.

The President (spoke in French): Before we proceed, I would like to point out the fact that, since the Fifth Committee has just completed its work, the reports are available only in English. They will be published in all the official languages of the United Nations as soon as possible. I thank participants for their understanding. If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Fifth Committee that are before the Assembly today. It was so decided. The President (spoke in French): I give the floor to the representative of France on a point of order. Mr. Allo (France) (spoke in French): I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having given me the floor to make a customary statement at the stage in the meeting in which we adopt draft resolutions. First of all, I would very much like to thank the various services for the manner in which they have produced the necessary documents in a very short period of time. However, I regret that the French version of the documents is not available. I would therefore like to recall that the official versions of documents to be adopted in the General Assembly must be made available in the six official languages of the United Nations prior to their formal adoption by the Assembly. I trust that this will be done in the future. In the immediate term, my delegation will not be opposed to their adoption at this meeting. The President (spoke in French): I take note of that statement. Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote. The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records. May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that: “When the same draft resolution is considered in
a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in
plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee”.
May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats. Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance. That means that, where recorded or separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Fifth Committee. In recent days, I have actively consulted all groups and many members on many occasions, in order to find a solution that is satisfactory to all parties while avoiding a vote in keeping with the tradition concerning budgetary matters. I am satisfied that the solution that we have found with the groups has been endorsed by the Fifth Committee. It is this solution that we will consider now in plenary meeting.

In order for the Assembly to consider the report of the Fifth Committee under sub-item (a) of agenda item 113, it will be necessary to reopen consideration of the sub-item. May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to reopen consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 113 and proceed immediately to its consideration? It was so decided.

The President (spoke in French): I shall now give the floor to the representatives who wish to speak in explanation of vote or position on the resolutions and decisions just adopted. Mr. Ayzouki (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation joined the consensus on the adoption of resolution 65/302, on the financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, and
A/65/PV.106

voted in favour of resolution 65/303, on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. My delegation would like to reiterate that the responsibility for financing these two missions should be borne by Israel, the occupier and party responsible for the aggression that led to their establishment in the first place. Our position is based on our consistent support for the principles underpinning resolution 1874 (S-IV), of 27 June 1963. Mr. Ronaghan (United States of America): The United States strongly supports the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which is implementing an important mandate. However, the use of General Assembly funding resolutions to pursue claims against a Member State procedurally is not correct. That is the reason that we have opposed the General Assembly resolutions on this item in previous years, since they require Israel to pay for the costs stemming from the Qana incident of 1996. Those resolutions were not consensus resolutions. Since shortly after the inception of the United Nations, the procedure that has been followed is that the Secretary-General presents and pursues a settlement of the Organization’s claims against a State or States. Using a funding resolution to legislate a settlement is inappropriate. It also politicizes the work of the Fifth Committee and should be avoided both now and in the future. Mr. Lafortune (Canada): Today, Canada found it necessary to oppose resolution 65/303, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon”. That should in no way be construed as a lack of confidence in or support for the work of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Canada has supported and continues to support the valuable work of UNIFIL. However, the resolution contains language that calls on Israel to provide compensation to the United Nations for the 1996 Qana incident. Canada found certain paragraphs of the resolution to be inappropriate, as they were an attempt to politicize the important work of the Fifth Committee. Moreover, those paragraphs were once against introduced into the resolution despite the serious reservations regarding them expressed by Canada and other delegations in previous years. Therefore, Canada cannot endorse the proposed approach to dealing with the issue of compensation and believes that it weakens the
resolution overall and draws attention from its principal purpose, which is to support the very useful work that UNIFIL has undertaken. Mr. Yanouka (Israel): First, I wish to express once again Israel’s thanks and support for United Nations peacekeeping forces, including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We express our gratitude to the troop-contributing countries, to the commanders and all those who support the important work of the diverse peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. Israel’s political and financial contributions represent our continuing commitment to the operations, goals and values of peacekeeping operations. We are proud to have good relations and long-standing cooperation with peacekeeping forces in our region. Notwithstanding what I have just said, I am compelled to express Israel’s disappointment with resolution 65/303, which contains specific language that is politicized and genuinely unhelpful as regards support for peacekeeping operations. Despite the professional nature of the Fifth Committee, preambular paragraph 4 and operative paragraphs 4, 5 and 15 are an attempt to institutionalize an anti-Israel narrative within the United Nations. For those reasons, my delegation called for a vote on the resolution and voted against it. Mr. Khachab (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First of all, I would like to thank all the friendly States that voted in favour of financing for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), especially the Group of 77 and China, the members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States. We would also like to thank UNIFIL for the role it has played since 1972. We attach great value to the enormous sacrifices made by the mission, including the hundreds who have died. We also wish to express our appreciation for the excellent relations between UNIFIL and Lebanese forces, as well as to thank all troop-contributing countries. With respect to the substance of resolution 65/303, we believe that the principle of collective responsibility for the financing of peacekeeping operations does not contradict the individual responsibility of States when they violate international law or their responsibility for the consequences of such
A/65/PV.106

acts. That includes reparations when a State is responsible for the damage it has caused, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 1 of resolution 55/235, on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping forces. I would like to remind the Assembly of the contents of the resolution that the Fifth Committee voted in favour of and which was just adopted by the General Assembly. Israel has not implemented the 18 General Assembly resolutions that require it to pay reparations following the shelling of Qana in 1996. This affected international forces. Approximately 100 civilians were killed, mainly children and elderly persons, and there were hundreds of injured. We must also recall that Israel owes over $1 million in reparations for material damage due to the bombing of the UNIFIL compound, as described in the report of the Secretary-General dated 7 May 1996 and contained in document S/1996/337. The Fifth Committee therefore has a duty to consider this issue. Finally, Israel must pay what it owes, even if that is incomplete in the light of the bombings of the schools of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East schools in 2003 and 2009.
