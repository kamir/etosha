==Early life and career==
Letterman was born in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. His father, Harry Joseph Letterman (April 15, 1915&nbsp;– February 13, 1973),<ref>Record of Harry Letterman, Social Security Death Index</ref> was a florist of English ancestry; his mother Dorothy Letterman (nee Hofert, now Dorothy Mengering), a church secretary of German ancestry, has been an occasional figure on the show, usually at holidays and birthdays.

He lived on the north side of Indianapolis, not far from Speedway, Indiana, and the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]. He enjoyed collecting model cars, including racers.<ref>Gary Graves. "Letterman Gets Moment in Hot Seat." ''[[USA Today]]'', May 23, 2005, p. 1C.</ref> In 2000, he told an interviewer for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' that, while growing up, he admired his father's ability to tell jokes and be the life of the party. Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/daveheart-letterman-0500 |title=Dave Letterman Profile - Interview with David Letterman |publisher=Esquire |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}</ref> The elder Letterman died of a second [[heart attack]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-01-14/news/18138686_1_angioplasty-family-history-high-cholesterol| title=Cholesterol high, has family history |author=Mitchell Fink, Eric Mink, Leo Standora, Richard Huff, Bill Hutchinson| publisher=New York Daily News| date=January 14, 2000| accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref> at age 57.
