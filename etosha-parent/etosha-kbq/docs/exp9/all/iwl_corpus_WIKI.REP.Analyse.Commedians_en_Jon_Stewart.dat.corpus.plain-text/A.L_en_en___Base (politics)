In [[politics]], the term '''base''' refers to a group of [[voter]]s who almost always support a single [[political party|party]]'s candidates for [[election|elected]] office. Base voters are very unlikely to vote for the candidate of an opposing party, regardless of the specific views each candidate holds. In the [[United States]], this is typically because high-level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a party's base in order to gain the party's [[nomination]] and thus be guaranteed [[ballot access]]. In the case of [[legislature|legislative]] elections, base voters often prefer to support their party's candidate against an otherwise appealing opponent in order to strengthen their party's chances of gaining a [[majority|simple majority]], typically the gateway to overarching power, in a [[legislature]].
