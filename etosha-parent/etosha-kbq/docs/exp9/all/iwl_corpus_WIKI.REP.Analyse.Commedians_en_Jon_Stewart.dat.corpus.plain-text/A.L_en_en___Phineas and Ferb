'''''Phineas and Ferb''''' is an [[United States|American]] animated comedy-musical television series. Originally broadcast as a [[Rollercoaster (Phineas and Ferb)|one-episode preview]] on August 17, 2007 and [[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror|again previewed]] on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on [[Disney Channel]], and follows [[Phineas Flynn]] and his [[England|English]] stepbrother [[Ferb Fletcher]]<ref name="AM1">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/1|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", PFage 1.|author=Strike, Joe|work=Animation World Magazine|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> on [[summer vacation]]. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, [[Candace Flynn|Candace]], who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to the boys' mother, [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]], and less frequently to their father, [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Lawrence Fletcher|Lawrence Fletcher]]. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the [[B-Plot]] almost always features [[Perry the Platypus]] working as a [[spy]] ("Agent P") for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of [[Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz]], a [[mad scientist]] driven largely by a need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

Creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] worked together on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. The creators also voice two of the main B-plot characters: Major Monogram and Dr. Doofenshmirtz. ''Phineas and Ferb'' was conceived after Povenmire sketched a triangular boy—the prototype for Phineas—in a restaurant. Povenmire and Marsh developed the series concept together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before securing a run on [[Disney Channel]].<ref name="AM1"/>

The series is also known for its musical numbers, which have appeared in almost every episode since the first-season "[[Flop Starz]]". Disney's managers particularly enjoyed the episode's song, "Gitchee, Gitchee Goo", and requested that a song appear in each subsequent episode.<ref name="AM2">{{cite web|url= http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/2|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 2.|author=Strike, Joe.|work=Animation World Magazine|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The show's creators write and record each number, and vary musical tempo depending on each song's dramatic use.<ref name="MSN"/> The music has earned the series a total of four [[Emmy]] nominations: in 2008 for the main title theme and for the song "I Ain't Got Rhythm" from the episode "[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]",<ref name="EmmySearch">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=&program=&start_year=2008&end_year=2008&network=180&web_category=All&winner=All|work=Results for Disney nominations in 2008|title=Emmy Awards website|accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref> and then in 2010 for the song "Come Home Perry" from the episode "Oh, There You Are, Perry" as well as one for its score.

==Plot==
[[File:Downtown Mobile 2008 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Povenmire drew inspiration for the show from his boyhood in [[Mobile, Alabama]].<ref name="OSP"/>]]
The show follows the adventures of stepbrothers [[Phineas Flynn]] ([[Vincent Martella]]) and [[Ferb Fletcher]] ([[Thomas Sangster]]), who live in the fictional town of Danville, in the [[Tri-State area]]. Their older sister, [[Candace Flynn]] ([[Ashley Tisdale]]), has two obsessions: "[[tattle|busting]]" Phineas and Ferb's schemes and ideas, and winning the attention of a boy named Jeremy ([[Mitchel Musso]]).<ref name="AM2"/> Meanwhile, the boys' pet [[platypus]], [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]], acts as a secret agent for an all-animal government organization<ref name="TCC">{{cite episode|title=Traffic Cam Caper|series=Arif and Ferb|season= 1|credits=Writers: Kim Roberson, Marc Ceccarelli|date= 2008-07-12|network=Disney Channel}}</ref><ref name="OL">{{cite episode|title=Out to Launch|series=Phineas and Ferb|season= 1|credits=Writers: Kim Roberson, Piero Piluso, Ken Osborne|date=2008-12-05|network=Disney Channel}}</ref> called the O.W.C.A.

Much of the series' humor relies on [[running gag]]s used in almost every episode, with slight variation.<ref name="wired">{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2008/07/phineas-and-fer/|title=Phineas and Ferb: Kid Inventors and a Secret Agent Platypus|work=Wired|date=2008-07-09|author=Blum, Matt}}</ref> Most episodes follow a pattern:
* Some incident gives Phineas an idea for a project, and he announces, "Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
* Meanwhile Perry slips away, using one of many hidden tunnels, to a secret underground base.  Phineas (or occasionally another character) remarks, "Hey, where's Perry?"
* Major Monogram briefs Perry (whom he calls "Agent P") on his mission; this sometimes amounts to nothing more than "Doctor Doofenshmirtz is up to something; find out what it is, and stop it!"
* Candace sees what the boys are doing, and resolves to tell Mom.
* Perry breaks into the skyscraper office of Doofenschmirtz Evil Inc.  Doofenschmirtz traps Perry and explains his current evil plan.  Perry escapes the trap and they battle.
* Phineas and Ferb complete their project.
* Mom gets home and Candace thinks that, at last, Mom will see what the boys have been up to and believe her.  But just as Mom is about to step into the back yard, all evidence vanishes, usually as a side effect of Doofenschmirtz's device.<ref name="ex"/><ref name="wired"/>
* Doofenschmirtz, foiled again, cries out, "Curse you Perry the Platypus!"

Other running gags:
* An adult asks Phineas if he is rather young to be performing some complex activities; he responds, "Yes, yes I am."  This is often parodied.
* Doofenshmirtz's names for his contraptions all have the same suffix, "-inator", as in Shrinkinator, Giant Dog Biscuit-inator, "Eradicate Rodney's -Inator", etc.<ref name="AM1"/> Eventually he starts calling them "inators" as a generic term.
* Doofenshmirtz has a daughter, Vanessa, who generally finds his work boring, but sometimes tries to prove to her mother that he is evil.  Like Candace, she always fails.
* Ferb rarely speaks more than once in an episode.
* Isabella, who has a crush on Phineas, comes into the backyard and asks, "Whatcha doin'?" in a distinctive singsong tone.  (In "Suddenly Suzy", after both Suzy and Candace speak that line, Isabella grumbles, "Do I even need to be here?")

Aspects of the show's humor are aimed at adults,<ref name="411 news"/> including its frequent pop-cultural references.<ref name="NYT"/> Co-creator Dan Povenmire, who had previously worked on ''[[Family Guy]]'', sought to create a less raunchy show that would make similar use of comic timing, [[Meta-joke|metahumor]], humorous blank stares, [[wordplay]] and breaking the [[Fourth wall]].<ref name="AM3"/> Povenmire describes the show as a combination of ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/phineas-and-ferb/family-guy-helped-inspire-phin-16407.aspx|title='Family Guy' Helped Inspire 'Phineas and Ferb'|date=2008-02-08|author=Santiago, Rosario|work=[[BuddyTV]]|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, the other co-creator, said the show was not created ''just'' for kids; he simply did not exclude them as an audience.<ref name="411 news"/>

The series' main characters live in a [[blended family]], a premise the creators considered underused in children's programming and which reflected Marsh's own upbringing.

''Phineas and Ferb'' follows structural conventions Povenmire and Marsh developed while writing ''Rocko's Modern Life'', whereby each episode features "a song or a musical number, plus a big action/chase scene".<ref name="AM2"/> Both creators had musical backgrounds, as Povenmire performed [[rock and roll]] in his college years<ref name="USC"/> and Marsh's grandfather was the bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]].<ref name="411 news"/>

The creators' original pitch to Disney emphasized Perry's signature "secret agent theme" and the song "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" from the episode "[[Flop Starz]]". Disney's managers enjoyed the songs and asked Povenmire and Marsh to write one for each episode.<ref name="AM2"/>

The songs span many genres, from 16th-century [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]] to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[show tunes]].<ref name="AM2"/> Each is written in an intensive session during episode production: a concept, score, and lyrics are developed quite quickly.<ref name="MSN">{{cite video|title= A Day With 'Phineas and Ferb' |url=http://entertainment.msn.com/news/article.aspx?news=352619|publisher=MSN TV.|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> Together, Marsh and Povenmire can "write a song about almost anything" and in only one hour at most.<ref name="Tampa"/> After they finish writing the song, Povenmire and Marsh sing it over the [[answering machine]] of series composer Danny Jacob on Friday nights.

==Origins==
[[File:Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh (2009).jpg|thumb|''Phineas and Ferb'' co-creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] in 2009.]]

===Early inspirations===
Dan Povenmire attributes the show's genesis to growing up in [[Mobile, Alabama]], where his mother told him never to waste a day of summer. To occupy himself, Povenmire undertook projects such as hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled, "My mom let me drape black material all the way across one end of our living room to use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera."<ref name="AM1"/><ref name="OSP">{{cite video|title=Original Pitch By Dan Povenmire|medium=DVD|people=Dan Povenmire, Jeff "Swampy" Marsh|publisher=[[Disney DVD]]|date=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.al.com/entertainment-press-register/2008/05/disney_animator_sees_summers_i.html#more|title= Disney animator sees summers in Mobile as inspiration|author=Brantley, Mark|work= Alabama press|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> He was an artistic [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.<ref name="USC"/> Meanwhile, Marsh grew up in a large, blended family.<ref name="411 news"/> As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several activities in order to have fun.<ref name="AM2"/>

===Conception===
[[File:Phineas original sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Drawn on [[butcher paper]], this first drawing of Phineas began a rapid growth of characters and the outline of the artistic style.<ref name="AM2"/>]]
While attending the [[University of Southern California]], Povenmire started a daily comic strip called ''Life Is a Fish'', and received money from the merchandise that was designed based on his series. Povenmire eventually dropped out and started drawing people on street corners to make a living, until he was finally called by [[Tommy Chong]] to work on a short bit of animation in the film ''[[Far Out Man]].'' Povenmire began to take up animation professionally, working on shows such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref name="USC">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:CdA_4QDEdOcJ:www.dailytrojan.com/2.1792/usc-dropout-makes-it-big-in-animation-1.201942+basically+brushed+me+off+Dan+povenmire&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a|archivedate=2009-09-24 |title= USC dropout makes it big in animation|author=Perez, Lauren|date=2008-05-12|work=[[Daily Trojan]]|url=http://www.dailytrojan.com/2.1792/usc-dropout-makes-it-big-in-animation-1.201942|accessdate=2009-08-26}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> Marsh had become a vice president of sales and marketing for a computer company, until he "freaked out" and decided to quit. His friend helped him put together a portfolio and go into the animation business.<ref name="411 news"/>

Povenmire and Marsh eventually started working across from each other as [[layout artist]]s on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The two bonded over mutual tastes in humor and music, becoming fast friends. They continued their working relationship as a writing team on the Nickelodeon series ''Rocko's Modern Life'',<ref name="AM1"/> where they conceived the idea for their own series.<ref name="AM1"/> While eating dinner at a Wild Thyme restaurant in [[South Pasadena, California]], Povenmire drew a quick sketch of a "triangle kid" on [[butcher paper]].<ref name="AM3">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/3|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 3.|author=Strike, Joe|work=Animation World Magazine|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> He tore it out and called Marsh that night to report, "Hey, I think we have our show."<ref name="QA"/>

The triangle [[doodle]] sparked rapid development of characters and designs.<ref name="AM3"/> Povenmire decided that his sketch "looked like a Phineas", and named Ferb after a friend who "owns more tools than anyone in the world."<ref name="CC"/> The creators based their character designs on angular shapes in homage to MGM/Warner Bros. animator/director [[Tex Avery]], adding geometric shapes to the backgrounds for continuity.<ref name="AM3"/>

===Pitching and pickup===
[[File:Disney Channel HQ.jpg|thumb|168px|right|[[Disney Channel]] was the first network to give the series a chance, though initially declined when [[Dan Povenmire]] originally pitched it to them.]]
Their early attempts to pitch the show failed and, though they remained committed to the concept, Povenmire and Marsh began to drift apart after their work on ''Rocko's''. Marsh moved to [[London, England|London]] and worked on shows including ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Bounty Hamster]].'' Povenmire began working on the primetime [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Family Guy]],''<ref name="AM1"/> always carrying a ''Phineas and Ferb'' portfolio<ref name="QA"/> for convenient pitching to networks like [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Fox Kids]]. These networks passed on the show, believing the series' premise was too complex to succeed.<ref name="AM1"/>

Povenmire persisted and later pitched the series to Nickelodeon, where it was considered by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated.<ref name="AM1"/> Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually "means they throw it in the trash later." Disney then surprised him by accepting.<ref name="USC"/> Said Povenmire, "Disney was the first to say, 'Let's see if you can do it in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see if you can do it for 26 episodes.{{'"}}<ref name="AM2"/>

Povenmire was initially worried that his work on ''[[Family Guy]]'' (an adult show known for its lowbrow humor) would concern Disney, which markets primarily towards families. However, the Disney Channel's Senior Vice President of Original Series, Adam Bonnett, was a ''Family Guy'' fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and received his pitch well.<ref name="AM2"/>

In 2006, after the Disney Channel accepted the show, Povenmire and Marsh turned their attention to the company's overseas executives. Instead of a normal script, the two drew out storyboards and played them in a reel. Povenmire voiced over the reel with his dialogue and added sound effects. This novel approach secured the executives' support.<ref name="OSP"/>

==Production==

===Writing style===
The show uses four major writers to devise story ideas according to "strict guidelines", such as that the boys' schemes never appear to be "magical." Stories are reviewed at weekly sessions on a Monday, then simultaneously scripted and storyboarded. A very rough design is built before the storyboard, featuring little more than suggested scenes and dialogue, is drafted; the writers then gather for a "play-by-play" walkthrough of the storyboard in front of the whole crew, whose reactions to the jokes are assessed before rewrites are made.<ref name="Rocko">{{cite web|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=134287|title='Rocko' writers return to TV with 'Phineas and Ferb'|work=Reading Eagle|date=2009-04-18|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The writers as well include running gags in every episode, which are generally lines spoken by characters.<ref name="AM1"/><ref name="trails">{{cite web|url= http://blogs.creativeloafing.com/culturesurfing/2009/05/14/phineas-ferb-trails-after-the-boys-of-summer/|title="Phineas and Ferb" trails after the boys of summer|work=Creating Loafing|date=2009-05-14|author=Holman, Curt|accessdate=2009-08-26}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> Almost every episode is set into two eleven-minute segments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/10314|title=''Phineas and Ferb'' Creators Talk About Emmy Nom!|author=Zahed, Ramin|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref>

===Visual aspects and animation===
[[File:PhineasFerbPaint designs.jpg|thumb|right|The stages of development for a scene during the opening theme, from the original draft (top) to the final design (bottom). The top appears briefly in the Season 1 theme.]]
[[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[South Korea]], [[Wang Film Productions]] in [[Taiwan]], and Synergy Animation and [[Hong Ying Animation]] in [[Shanghai]] animate the series in [[2D Animation]] using the software packages [[Toon Boom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justpressplay.net/movie-reviews/929-dvd-reviews/4835-Phineas-and-Ferb-The-Daze-of-Summer.html|title=Phineas and Ferb: The Daze of Summer|work=Just Press Play|author=Walker, Lex|date=2009-02-14|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Povenmire undertakes the bulk of production direction, along with [[Zac Moncrief]] and Robert Hughes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/phineas-ferb/cast/289680|title=Phineas and Ferb: Cast & Details|work=TV Guide|accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> The series adopts artistic features from animator [[Tex Avery]], such as geometric shapes integrated into characters, objects, and backgrounds. Dan Povenmire said of this inclusion, "There's a little bit of Tex Avery in there-he had that very graphic style [in his later cartoons]."<ref name="AM3"/> Triangles are featured as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in the background of every episode, sometimes in trees or buildings.<ref name="411 news"/>

Bright colors are also a prominent element of the animation. Marsh elaborates, "The idea at the end of the day was candy. One of the things that I think works so well is that the characters are so bright and candy-colored and our backgrounds are a much more realistic depiction of the world: the soft green of the grass, the natural woods for the fence. In order for all the stuff that they do to work, their world needs to be grounded in reality." The designers sought to keep their characters visually simple, so that kids "would easily be able to draw [them] themselves." Characters were also crafted to be recognizable from a distance, a technique the creators say is based on [[Matt Groening]]'s goal of making characters recognizable by silhouette.<ref name="411 news">{{cite web|url=http://www.resource411.com/411Update/Issue/Articles/Story.cfm?StoryID=1020|title=Phineas and Ferb: Music, Mischief, And The Endless Summer Vacation|work=411 News|author=Galas, Marjorie|accessdate=2009-07-03}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

[[Madison Pettis]] also stars as Adyson Sweetwater;

The show's casting organization is responsible for selecting most of the [[voice actors]] and actresses, choosing actors such as [[Vincent Martella]] and [[Mitchel Musso]] for major roles based on perceived popularity with target demographics. Povenmire and Marsh select guest stars, casting people that they "really want to work with". They also solicit guest roles from actors they feel would lend an interesting presence to the show.<ref name="CC">{{cite video|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2s8uUwQK9c|title= Vincent @ Comic Con 2008 ''(1:56)''|publisher=MSN TV News|date=2008-08-09|accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref>

Guest stars have included [[pop culture]] figures like [[Damian Lewis]], boxer [[Evander Holyfield]], film stars [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Ben Stiller]], and pop singer [[Kelly Clarkson]].

==Reception and achievements==

===Reviews===
The show has received generally positive reviews. The ''[[New York Times]]'' commented favorably, describing the show as "''[[Family Guy]]'' with an espionage subplot and a big dose of [[magical realism]]". It considered the pop-culture references ubiquitous "but [placed] with such skill that it seems smart, not cheap."<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/arts/television/01phin.html?_r=2&ref=television&oref=slogin|title= Bored Stepbrothers, Intrepid Platypus |date=2008-02-01|author=Stewart, Susan|accessdate=2009-07-03|work=New York Times}}</ref> [[Whitney Matheson]] wrote in her ''[[USA Today]]'' blog "[[Pop Candy]]" that the series was an achievement in children's programming.

Among the negative reviews is one that charges the series with a lack of originality. Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone argued that the show is "derivative, but obviously so, and shorn of even the best features of what has been stolen." Zeus took issue with the writing, feeling that certain jokes and conventions were "ripped-off" from other shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/21300/phineas-and-ferb-spawn-of-frankenstein|title="Phineas and Ferb": Spawn of Frankenstein|work=Toon Zone|author=Zeus, Maxie|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> Kevin McDonough of ''Sun Coast Today'' criticized the show for its plot complexity, constant action, and "characters [that] can do just about anything."

In 2009, Disney licensed a [[Nintendo DS]] game, titled like the show, ''[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb]]''. The game's story follows the title characters as they try to build a roller coaster to stop boredom over the summer (in reference to the show's pilot episode).
The player controls Phineas, Ferb, and occasionally Agent P (Perry the Platypus). Phineas scavenges for spare parts for the rollercoaster while Ferb fixes various objects around town, gaining access to new areas as a result. Ferb can also construct new parts of the rollercoaster and its vehicle-themed carts. Each activity features a short mini-game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/16586-phineas-and-ferb-ds-game-review |title=Phineas and Ferb :: DS Game Review |publisher=Kidzworld |date= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/phineas-and-ferb|title=Phineas and Ferb—Nintendo DS|work=GameSpy|accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/game/phineas-and-ferb/11032|title=Phineas and Ferb Video Game|work=Game Trailers|accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref> The game was well received and garners a 76.67% on [[GameRankings]].<ref name="GR">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/DS/955460-phineas-and-ferb/index.html|title=Phineas and Ferb for the DS|work=Game Rankings|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref>  A sequel entitled Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again was released on September 14, 2010.

The show features two boys who attempt to be like Phineas and Ferb by taking part in adventures to alleviate boredom.<ref name="UK 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/lewes-district-news/Seaford-boy-stars-in-Disney.5159599.jp|title=Seaford boy stars in Disney show|work=Mid Sussex Times|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The series aims at educating kids and promoting activity and creativity.<ref name="UK 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/seaford/Schoolboy-back-for-Disney-fun.5153557.jp|title=Schoolboy back for Disney fun|work=Eastbourne Today|date=2009-04-08|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> It entered its second season on April 10, 2009.<ref name="UK 1"/>

''Phineas and Ferb'' also has been briefly referenced in a few literary works in recent years. ''Love through the Eyes of an Idiot: A True Story of Finding the Secret of Love and Romance'' uses an analysis that states that a woman the author met was the "Phineas to [his] Ferb."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Love through the Eyes of an Idiot: A True Story of Finding the Secret of Love, Sex, and Romance|last=King|first=J.

The television series ''[[Psych]]'' has made reference to ''Phineas and Ferb'' in its sixth season. In the episode "Shawn Rescues Darth Vader", main character Shawn Spencer (portrayed by [[James Roday]]) states that he learned his British accent from the granddad on ''Phineas and Ferb'' (he tells this to guest star [[Malcolm McDowell]] who also happens to voice the granddad). And, in "The Amazing Psych Man & Tap-Man, Issue #2", Shawn once again name drops the series stating, "I'm missing a Phineas and Ferb marathon. Perry the Platypus. He's a real platypus."

==''Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever''==
''Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever'' is a touring two-act stage of the TV show. A projection system plays video in the same style as the TV show on the rear of the stage; the characters are first introduced there in their cartoon forms, but then use a backyard slide that continues into a physical slide out of which the live cast members emerge into the real world. The performers wear [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]] to make their characters resemble their cartoon counterparts—mostly head pieces, but a full body suit in the cases of Buford and Perry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thisweeknews.com/content/stories/2011/11/02/disney-live.html|title='Phineas and Ferb: The Best Live Tour Ever!' coming to Columbus|date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref>
