In his book ''Rock This!'', Rock gives his birth date as February 7, 1966. But Rock stated he was 42 years old on his February 28, 2007, appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which is pre-taped and not broadcast live.</ref> is an American comedian, actor, screenwriter, producer, and director.

After working as a standup comic and appearing in small film roles, Rock came to wider prominence as a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the early 1990s. He went on to more prominent film roles, and a series of acclaimed comedy specials for [[HBO]].

He was voted the fifth-greatest stand-up comedian in a poll conducted by [[Comedy Central]]. He was also voted in the United Kingdom as the ninth greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4’s ''100 Greatest Stand-Ups'' in 2007, and again in the updated 2010 list as the eighth greatest stand-up comic.

==Early life and education==
Rock was born in [[Andrews, South Carolina]]. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]], New York. A few years later, they relocated and settled in the working-class area of [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]].<ref name="bravo">{{cite episode| title = Chris Rock| series = Inside the Actors Studio| serieslink = Inside the Actors Studio| network = [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]| airdate = March 13, 2007| season = 13| number = 6}}</ref> His mother, Rosalie (née Tingman), was a teacher and social worker for the mentally handicapped; his father, Julius Rock, was a truck driver and newspaper deliveryman.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rolling Rock: Chris Rock Hits His Hollywood Stride|author=Cindy Pearlman|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chrisrock/articles/story/5920132/rolling_rock_chris_rock_hits_his_hollywood_stride |work=Rolling Stone|date=January 29, 2001|accessdate=June 17, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214191014/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chrisrock/articles/story/5920132/rolling_rock_chris_rock_hits_his_hollywood_stride |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}</ref> Julius died in 1988 after [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] surgery.<ref name=yahoomovies /> Chris's younger brothers [[Tony Rock|Tony]], Kenny,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and Jordan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/JayRockStar619|title=Jordan Rock: JayRockStar619's Channel|publisher=YouTube|date=August 31, 2006|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> are also in the entertainment business.

==Career==
Rock began doing stand-up comedy in 1984 in New York City’s [[Catch a Rising Star]].<ref name="bravo"/><ref name=bigger/> He slowly rose up the ranks of the comedy circuit in addition to earning bit roles in the film ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka|I’m Gonna Git You Sucka]]'' and the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]''. Upon seeing his act at a nightclub, [[Eddie Murphy]] befriended and mentored the aspiring comic. Murphy gave Rock his first film role in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''. Chris Rock is often confused with [[Chris Tucker]].<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2pi16o/chris_rock_here_ama/cmwuy7h</ref>

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Rock became a cast member of the popular [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1990. He and other new cast members [[Chris Farley]], [[Adam Sandler]], [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]] became known as the [[Bad Boys of SNL]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 1991, he released his first comedy album, ''[[Born Suspect]]'' and won acclaim for his dramatic role as a [[crack cocaine|crack]] addict in the film ''[[New Jack City]]''. His tenure on ''SNL'' gave Rock national exposure.

===Standup success===
A frustrated Rock left ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1993, appearing instead as a special guest star on the predominantly [[African-American]] sketch show ''[[In Living Color]]''. The show, however, was cancelled months later. Rock then decided to concentrate on a film career. He wrote and starred in the [[mockumentary]] ''[[CB4]]'' but the film was not a success. Acting jobs became scarce, and Rock abandoned Hollywood to concentrate on stand-up comedy.<ref name="bennun"/>

Rock starred in his first [[HBO]] comedy special in 1994 titled ''[[Big Ass Jokes]]''. But it was his second stand-up special, 1996’s ''[[Chris Rock: Bring the Pain|Bring the Pain]]'', that reinvented Rock as one of the best comedians in the industry.<ref name="roll"/><ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:178087~T1 AllMovie.com review]</ref> For it Rock won two [[Emmy Awards]] and gained large critical acclaim.<ref name="SweeneyGuardian2001">{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,499318,00.html|title=Chris Rock: The funniest man in America?|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=June 1, 2001|accessdate=October 20, 2007  | first=Kathy | last=Sweeney}}</ref> The segment on race in America, in which Rock used the “N word” extensively, was most talked about.<ref name="SweeneyGuardian2001"/> Adding to his popularity was his much-publicized role as a commentator for [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' during the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 Presidential elections]]<ref name="roll"/> which earned him another Emmy nomination.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Rock also was the voice for the "Lil Penny" puppet who was the alter ego to basketball star [[Penny Hardaway]] in a series of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoe commercials from 1994–1998,<ref name="roll">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n7_v52/ai_19383834|title=Chris Rock: hot comic is on the roll of his life|author=Chappell, Kevin|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]| date=May  1997 |accessdate=October 20, 2007}}</ref> and hosted the '97 MTV Video Music Awards.

Rock later had two more [[HBO]] comedy specials: ''[[Bigger & Blacker]]'' in 1999, and ''[[Never Scared]]'' in 2004. Articles relating to both specials called Rock “the funniest man in America” in ''Time''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/pro.crock.html|title=America's Best Artist's and Entertainers|work=Time|author=Handy, Bruce|year=2001|accessdate=October 20, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071010123021/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/pro.crock.html |archivedate = October 10, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref name="ew">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,600310,00.html|title=Chris Rock On Fire|work=Entertainment Weekly|author=Wolk, Josh|date=March 19, 2004|accessdate=October 13, 2007}}</ref> HBO also aired his talk show, ''[[The Chris Rock Show]]'', which gained critical acclaim for Rock's interviews with celebrities and politicians. The show won an Emmy for writing. His television work has won him a total of three [[Emmy Award]]s and 15 nominations.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} By the end of the decade, Rock was established as one of the preeminent stand-up comedians and comic minds of his generation.

During this time, Rock also translated his comedy into print form in the book ''Rock This!'' and released the [[Grammy Award]]-winning comedy albums, ''[[Roll with the New]]'', ''Bigger & Blacker'' and ''Never Scared''.

Rock's fifth HBO special, ''[[Chris Rock: Kill the Messenger|Kill the Messenger]]'', premiered on September 27, 2008, and won him another Emmy for outstanding writing for a variety or music program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/tag/kill+the+messenger/|title=Chris Rock to do his fifth HBO special in September – TCA Report|publisher=[[TVSquad.com]]|author=Sample, Kristin|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}</ref>

===Film star===
[[File:ChrisRock.jpg|thumb|Rock at the [[Israel]]i premiere of ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'', on November 22, 2008.]]It was not until the success of his stand-up act in the late 1990s that Rock began receiving major parts in films. Though he started off with supporting roles in films such as ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', and ''[[Nurse Betty]]'', he went on to star in films like ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', ''[[Bad Company (2002 film)|Bad Company]]'', and  ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]''. Some of his 2010s film appearances include ''[[Death at a Funeral (2010 film)|Death at a Funeral]]'', ''[[Grown Ups (2010 film)|Grown Ups]]'', and ''[[2 Days in New York]]''.

Rock has also increasingly worked behind the camera, both as a writer and director of ''[[Head of State (movie)|Head of State]]'' and ''[[I Think I Love My Wife]]'' (both in which he played the lead role). Additionally, he has done voice work for the popular ''[[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]'' animated film franchise.

Following the release of his first documentary, 2009's ''[[Good Hair (film)|Good Hair]]'', Rock is working on a documentary about debt called ''Credit Is the Devil''.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Furey | first = Phil | title = Chris Rock sets comic sights on devilish credit

===Television producer===
In the fall of 2005, the [[UPN]] television network premiered a comedy series called ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', based on Rock's school days, of which he is the executive producer and narrator. The show has garnered both critical and ratings success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Icon Chris Rock|url=http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7480&src=maxim_ed |publisher=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]| date=April  2007 }}</ref> The series was nominated for a 2006 [[Golden Globe]] for Best TV Series (Musical or Comedy), a 2006 [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite New Television Comedy, and two 2006 [[Emmy Awards]] for costuming and cinematography.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He produced the series ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell]]'', which premiered in August 2012.

===Academy Awards===
In early 2005, Rock hosted the [[77th Academy Awards]] ceremony. The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an "edge" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying ''"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!"'' During one segment Rock asked, "Who is this guy?" in reference to actor [[Jude Law]] seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent [[Tom Cruise]] (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: "If you want [[Tom Cruise]] and all you can get is [[Jude Law]], wait [to make the film]!"). Subsequently, a defensive [[Sean Penn]] took the stage to present and said, "In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors." (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]''.) Law was not the only actor that Rock poked fun at that evening, however—he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, "If you want [[Denzel Washington|Denzel]] [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!" Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005 "Chris Rock effect fails to boost Oscars"; ''[[The Guardian Unlimited]]''; March 2, 2005]</ref> Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as "idiotic", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6849862/ Lundegaard, Erik; "Hey, Chris Rock: Shut the [bleep&#93; up: A film critic takes the Oscar host to task for his film criticism"; [[MSNBC]]; February 3, 2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html "Chris Rock, Oscars host, slams Oscars"; ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''/[[Reuters]]; February 16, 2005]</ref>

===Music videos===
Rock's first music video was for his song "Your Mother's Got a Big Head" from his album ''Born Suspect''. Rock also made videos for his songs "Champagne" from ''Roll With the New'' and "[[No Sex (In the Champagne Room)]]" from ''Bigger & Blacker''. Chris Rock also directed and appeared in the music video for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] song "[[Hump de Bump]]".

Rock appeared in the [[Big Daddy Kane]] music video "Smooth Operator" as a guy getting his hair cut.

He also appeared in [[Johnny Cash|Johnny Cash's]] "[[God's Gonna Cut You Down]]," one of the many celebrities seen [[lip-synch]]ing the song.

===Stage plays===
In 2011, Rock appeared on Broadway in [[Stephen Adly Guirgis]]' play ''[[The Motherfucker with the Hat]]''<ref name="NYTimes Hat announce">Healy, Patrick. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/chris-rock-is-ringed-in-by-broadways-hat/ "Chris Rock Takes On Broadway in ‘Hat’"], ''The New York Times'' blog, October 22, 2010.</ref> with [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Annabella Sciorra]].<ref name="NYTimes Hat announce" />  Rock was nominated for a Drama League Award.

==Comedic style and views==
Rock's subject matter typically involves family, politics, romance, music, [[Social class|class relationships]], and [[race relations]] in the United States. Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seem rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock [[desegregation busing|bused]] to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst]] (an Italian-ethnic neighborhood of Brooklyn known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', the comedian recalls, "My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings."<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. "I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood..."</ref>

The comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in standup comedy—or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry—should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself directly at odds with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has reprimanded Rock both explicitly—for his famous/notorious [[Niggas vs. Black People]] track—and implicitly, for heavy use of the word "nigger."<ref>Morano, Marc. CNSNews. "Bill Cosby to Blacks," July 2, 2004. "When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car—those children hear that... That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it."</ref> Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: "Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much."<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This''; Hyperion, 1997, p. 16.</ref> Often the subject of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]], when asked about [[paparazzi]] and the other negative aspects of [[celebrity|fame]], Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: "You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips."<ref>{{cite web|title=Everybody Loves Chris |url=http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html}}</ref>

At the London [[Live Earth concert, London|Live Earth]] concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the BBC, before introducing the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], Rock called the crowd "[[motherfucker]]s" and "shit" after a brief sigh when he said he was joking. Due to the broadcast being at 5:45&nbsp;pm Rock was immediately cut off, and the BBC made several apologies for his use of the word "motherfucker."<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/live-earth/29530 "Chris Rock defends Live Earth swearing: Comic is critical of climate change show despite being host"; nme.com; July 7, 2007.]</ref>

Chris Rock has been an avid fan of the [[New York Mets]] baseball team since childhood. He famously complained that his team "had no money" in a comedic rant during a 2011 interview with David Letterman.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chris Rock Complains About The Mets On Letterman (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/01/chris-rock-mets-letterman_n_843579.html
