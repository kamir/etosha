'''Jack Handey''' (born February 25, 1949) is an American [[humorist]]. He is best known for his '''Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey''', a large body of [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] [[one-liner joke]]s, as well as his "Fuzzy Memories" and "My Big Thick Novel" shorts. Although many people assume otherwise,<ref name="Handey bio">Biography, "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey" Website, http://www.deepthoughtsbyjackhandey.com/answer.html. Accessed June 6, 2008.</ref><ref name="TM2002">Handey, Jack: "Deep Thoughts about Me: Questions I Am Often Asked (and My Answers)", ''[[Texas Monthly]],'' January 2002.</ref> Handey is a real person, not a [[pen name]] or  character.

==Early years==
Handey was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], in 1949. His family later moved to [[El Paso, Texas]], where Handey attended [[Eastwood High School (El Paso, Texas)|Eastwood High School]] (where he was editor of ''Sabre,'' the school newspaper) and the [[University of Texas at El Paso]].

Handey's earliest writing job was for a newspaper, the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''. He lost the job, in his words, after writing "an article that offended local car dealerships".<ref name="TM2002" />  His first comic writing was with comedian [[Steve Martin]]. According to Martin, Handey got a job writing for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after Martin introduced Handey to the show's creator, [[Lorne Michaels]].<ref>"Martin Writes Off Fried Shrimp Days," ''[[New York Post]]'', October 1, 1999.</ref>  
For several years Handey worked on other television projects: the [[Canada|Canadian]] sketch series ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'' in 1980; the 1980 TV special ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!|Steve Martin: Comedy Is Not Pretty]]''; and Lorne Michaels' short-lived sketch show on NBC called ''[[The New Show]]'' in 1984. Handey returned to ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1985 as a writer and co-producer.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0359532}}</ref>

==Deep Thoughts==

In April 1984, ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' published the first of Jack Handey's Deep Thoughts. Additional Deep Thoughts appeared in the October and November 1984 editions as well as in the short-lived comedy magazine ''[[Army Man (magazine)|Army Man]]'', while more appeared in 1988 in ''[[The New Mexican (magazine)|The New Mexican]]''. The one-liners were to become Handey's signature work, notable for their concise humor and their outlandish hypothetical situations. For example:

*If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.<ref>

Handey's work next showed up in the [[Michael Nesmith]]-produced TV series ''[[Television Parts]]'' in the format which would later become famous on ''Saturday Night Live'' (though in [[Television Parts]], Nesmith provided the narration). Some of these bits appeared in the compilation video of that program, ''[[Doctor Duck's Super Secret All-Purpose Sauce]]''.
 
Between 1991 and 1998, ''Saturday Night Live'' included Deep Thoughts on the show as an interstitial segment between sketches. Introduced by [[Phil Hartman]] and read live by Handey (neither actually appeared on screen), the one-liners proved to be extremely popular. Hartman would intone "And now, Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey...", and peaceful easy listening music would play while the screen showed soothing pastoral scenes, much like a [[New Age]] relaxation video. Handey would then read the Deep Thought as the text to it scrolled across the screen. They became an enduring feature of ''SNL'', which often had multiple Thoughts in each episode, and made Handey a well-known name.

==Other SNL work==
Other Handey pieces that appeared on SNL included [[Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer]],<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/04/15/books.jack.handey.ap/index.html "Deep Thoughts' man offers 'What I'd Say to the Martians'"] from [[CNN]]</ref> "Fuzzy Memories" which depicted reenactments of a twisted childhood memory and aired in the late 1990s, and the short-lived "My Big Thick Novel", which were spoken excerpts from a very long book in the style of "Deep Thoughts" and which aired during the 2001â€“03 seasons of SNL.

Handey is also credited with creating [[Toonces the Driving Cat|Toonces]], the cat who could drive a car, although badly  ("See, I told you he could drive! Just not very well!").<ref name="toonces">Carman, John: "We Paws for This Message", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', February 14, 1992</ref> The recurring skit originated in 1989 with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Victoria Jackson]] as the crash-prone kitty's owners. In 1992 NBC aired a half-hour Toonces special. Handey, who owned a real cat by the same name, once said he couldn't remember exactly how he dreamed up the premise. He said, "It was just one of those free association ideas you write down and look at later and think, 'Maybe.'"<ref name="toonces"/>
