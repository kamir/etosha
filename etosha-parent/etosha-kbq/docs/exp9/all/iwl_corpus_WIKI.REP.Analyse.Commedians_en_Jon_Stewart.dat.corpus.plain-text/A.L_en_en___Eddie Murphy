'''Edward Regan''' "'''Eddie'''" '''Murphy''' (born April 3, 1961) is an American comedian, actor, writer, singer, and director.

Box-office takes from Murphy's films make him the 4th-highest grossing actor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=eddiemurphy.htm |title=Eddie Murphy |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&sort=sumgross&p=.htm |title=People Index |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> He was a regular cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1980 to 1984 and has worked as a stand-up comedian. He was ranked #10 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.18481 |title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time |publisher=Listology |date=May 19, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

He has received [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for his performances in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'', [[Beverly Hills Cop (film series)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' series]], ''[[Trading Places]]'', and ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''. In 2007, he won the [[Golden Globe]] for Best Supporting Actor and received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of [[soul music|soul]] singer James "Thunder" Early in ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56447/dreamgirls-snares-multiple-golden-globe-nods|title='Dreamgirls' Snares Multiple Golden Globe Nods|date=December 14, 2006|author=Kilday, Gregg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

Eddie Murphy's work as a voice actor includes Thurgood Stubbs in ''[[The PJs]]'', [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] in the ''[[Shrek]]'' series and the [[Chinese dragon]] [[Mushu]] in Disney's ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''. In some of his films, he plays multiple roles in addition to his main character, intended as a tribute to one of his idols [[Peter Sellers]], who played multiple roles in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and elsewhere. Murphy has played multiple roles in ''[[Coming to America]]'', [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', the ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|Nutty Professor]]'' films (where he played the title role in two incarnations, plus his character's father, brother, mother, and grandmother), ''[[Bowfinger]]'', ''[[Norbit]]'', and ''[[Meet Dave]]''.

As of 2014, films featuring Murphy have grossed over $3.8 billion in the United States and Canada [[box office]], and $6.6 billion worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=EddieMurphy.htm |title=Eddie Murphy |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>

==Early life==
Murphy was born and raised in the [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JtAEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SzoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6872,5299502 ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> His mother, Lillian, was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.<ref name="actors">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''</ref><ref name=nymag>{{cite news|last=Flippo|first=Chet|title=Eddie Murphy Live: The razor-edged king of late night comedy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j-ICAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA56&dq=eddie%20murphy%20new%20york%20magazine%20oct.%2011%201982&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=June 27, 2011|newspaper=New York |date=October 11, 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Eddie-Murphy.html |title=Eddie Murphy Biography (1961–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800011536/bio ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> His father died when he was young.

Later, he and his older brother [[Charlie Murphy|Charlie]] were raised in [[Roosevelt, New York]] by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch, a foreman at an ice cream plant.<ref name="actors"/> Around the age of 15, Murphy was writing and performing his own routines, which were heavily influenced by [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Richard Pryor]].<ref name="actors" />

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
His early comedy was characterized by frequent swearing and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people (including [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s (WASPs), African Americans, Italian Americans, overweight people, and gay people). Murphy released two stand-up specials. ''[[Eddie Murphy (album)|Eddie Murphy]]'' was his first album, released in 1982.  ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious|Delirious]]'' was filmed in 1983 in Washington, D.C. Due to the popularity of ''Delirious'', his concert film ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]'' (1987) received a wide theatrical release, grossing $50 million; the movie was filmed in the Felt Forum section of Madison Square Garden in New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eddie Murphy Delirious|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085474/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Eddie Murphy Raw|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092948/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref>

===1980s acting career===
[[File:EddieMurphy1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Murphy in 1988]]
Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on ''Saturday Night Live'' (SNL), and was credited with helping to revitalize the show during the early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Shales |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> His notable characters included a grownup version of the [[Little Rascals]] character [[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]];<ref name=buckwheat>{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Shales |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |ISBN=0-316-73565-5 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC |page=549}}</ref> a street-wise children's show host named Mr. Robinson (a spoof of [[Fred Rogers]], who found it amusing<ref>{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Shales |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-73565-5 |page=238}}</ref>); and a morose, cynical [[Gumby]], whose trademark slogan became an SNL catchphrase: "I'm Gumby, dammit!"<ref name=buckwheat/>  The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashion—assassinated, on camera, in front of [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]—at Murphy's request, after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to "Do Buckwheat! Do Buckwheat!"<ref name="snlbackstage20110220">{{cite episode | title=Saturday Night Live Backstage | network=NBC | airdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref>  In ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's February, 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Murphy was ranked second (behind [[John Belushi]]).  "It is customary (and accurate) to say that Eddie Murphy is the only reason SNL survived the five-year wilderness without [[Lorne Michaels]]," they noted.<ref>''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.</ref>

In 1982, Murphy made his big screen debut in the film ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' with [[Nick Nolte]].<ref name="actors"/> ''48 Hrs.'' proved to be a hit when it was released in the Christmas season of 1982. Nolte was scheduled to host the December 11, 1982, Christmas episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', but became too ill to host, so Murphy took over. He became the only cast member to host while still a regular. Murphy opened the show with the phrase, "Live from New York, It's the Eddie Murphy Show!" The following year, Murphy starred in ''[[Trading Places]]'' with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Dan Aykroyd]].<ref name="actors"/> The movie marked the first of Murphy's collaborations with director [[John Landis]] (who also directed Murphy in ''[[Coming to America]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'') and proved to be an even greater box office success than ''48 Hrs.'' In 1984, Murphy starred in the successful action comedy film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.<ref name="actors"/> The film was Murphy's first solo leading role.<ref name="actors"/> ''Beverly Hills Cop'' grossed over $230&nbsp;million at the box office and {{As of|2012|August|lc=on}} was 41st in the list of all-time total U.S. box office grossers (4th-highest amongst "R" rated films), after adjusting for inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref>

In 1984, Murphy appeared in ''[[Best Defense]]'', co-starring [[Dudley Moore]]. Murphy, who was credited as a "Strategic Guest Star", was added to the film after an original version was completed but tested poorly with audiences. ''Best Defense'' was a major financial and critical disappointment. When he hosted ''SNL'', Murphy joined the chorus of those bashing ''Best Defense'', calling it "the worst movie in the history of everything". Murphy's ''[[Trading Places]]'' co-star [[Dan Aykroyd]] had originally written the character of [[Winston Zeddemore]] in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' specifically for Murphy, but he was unable to commit at the time due to the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' shooting schedule. The part ultimately went to [[Ernie Hudson]]. Murphy was also offered a part in 1986's ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', a role that, after being heavily re-written from comic relief to love interest, ultimately went to future ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' star [[Catherine Hicks]]. By this point<ref>according to the autobiography of the film's director and co-star, [[Leonard Nimoy]].</ref> Murphy's near-exclusive contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] rivaled ''Star Trek'' as Paramount's most lucrative franchise.

In 1986, Murphy starred in the [[supernatural]] comedy, ''[[The Golden Child]]''.<ref name="actors"/> ''The Golden Child'' was originally intended to be a serious adventure picture starring [[Mel Gibson]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} After Gibson turned the role down, the project was offered to Murphy as it was subsequently rewritten as a partial comedy.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Although ''The Golden Child'' (featuring Murphy's "I want the knife!" routine) performed well at the box office, the movie was not as critically acclaimed as ''[[48 Hrs.]]'', ''[[Trading Places]]'', and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. ''The Golden Child'' was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the [[supernatural]] setting as opposed to the more "street smart" settings of Murphy's previous efforts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A year later, Murphy reprised his role of Axel Foley in the [[Tony Scott]]-directed ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''. It was a box office success, grossing almost $300&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beverlyhillscop2.htm|title=Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> Producers reportedly wanted to turn the ''Beverly Hills Cop'' franchise into a weekly television series.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Murphy declined the television offer, but was willing to do a film sequel instead.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Murphy was one of the last movie actors to sign an exclusive contract with a studio.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In this case, it was [[Paramount Pictures]], which released all of his early films.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Singing career===
Murphy is also a singer, having frequently provided background vocals to songs released by [[The Bus Boys]], which their song "The Boys Are Back in Town" was featured in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and Murphy's comedy special ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious]]''. As a solo artist, Murphy had two hit singles, "[[Party All the Time]]" (which was produced by [[Rick James]]) and "Put Your Mouth on Me" in the mid-1980s (although he actually started singing earlier in his career, with the songs "Boogie in Your Butt" and "Enough Is Enough", the latter being a parody of [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Donna Summer]]'s 1979 song, "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)|No More Tears]]". They both appear on his 1982 self-titled comedy album.) "Party All the Time" was featured on Murphy's 1985 debut album ''[[How Could It Be]]'', which included a minor follow-up [[R&B]] hit in the title track, a duet with vocalist Crystal Blake. This track was written by Rusty Hamilton and was produced by Stevie Wonder's cousin Aquil Fudge after a brief falling out and bet with Rick James. In 2004, [[VH-1]] and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' voted "Party All the Time" number seven among the "50 Worst Songs of All-Time." [[Sharam Tayebi|Sharam]] used a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of the song for the UK #8 hit "PATT (Party All The Time)" in 2006.

Murphy recorded the album ''[[Love's Alright]]'' in the early 1990s. He performed in a music video of the single "[[Whatzupwitu]]", featuring [[Michael Jackson]]. He recorded a duet with [[Shabba Ranks]] called "I Was a King". In 1992, Murphy appeared in Michael Jackson's "[[Remember the Time]]" alongside [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Iman Abdulmajid|Iman]].

Though uncredited, Murphy provided vocal work on ''SNL'' castmate [[Joe Piscopo]]'s comedy single, "The Honeymooners Rap."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Piscopo impersonated [[Jackie Gleason]] on the single, while Murphy provided an imitation of [[Art Carney]].

In ''[[Coming to America]]'', he imitated [[Jackie Wilson]] when he sang "To Be Loved", but because the character he was playing had a thick accent, he had to sing it in character. In later years, Murphy performed several songs in the ''[[Shrek (film series)|Shrek]]'' film franchise. In the first film, he performed a version of "[[I'm a Believer]]" in the film's final scene; in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' he performed [[Ricky Martin]]'s hit "[[Livin' La Vida Loca]]" along with co-star [[Antonio Banderas]].

In 2013 he released his first single in years titled "Red Light", a [[reggae]] song featuring [[Snoop Lion]]. He is also working on a new album titled ''9''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-eddie-murphy-feat-snoop-lion-%E2%80%98red-light%E2%80%99 |title=New Music: Eddie Murphy Feat. Snoop Lion 'Red Light'|work=Vibe |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

===1990s career===

From 1989 and through most of the early 1990s, box office results and reviews for Murphy's films were strong, but by 1992 results for both dropped, hitting a low point with the critically panned ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' (1994),<ref>{{cite web|title=Beverly Hills Cop 3 (1994) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beverly_hills_cop_3/ |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> a movie Murphy would ultimately denounce during an appearance on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'',<ref name="actors"/> although he did find box office success with ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'' and ''[[Another 48 Hrs.]]'' ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' featured Murphy, who had previously been known only as a performer, as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, [[Charlie Murphy]], as well as supporting roles for Murphy's comic idols [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Richard Pryor]].<ref name="actors"/>

During this period Murphy was criticized by filmmaker [[Spike Lee]] for not using his show business stature to help black actors break into film, despite Murphy's films (especially those he produced) often being populated with predominantly black casts (''[[Coming To America]], [[Harlem Nights]], [[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]], [[Vampire in Brooklyn]], [[Life (1999 film)|Life]]''). Many black actors who would later gain wider recognition make early appearances in Murphy films such as [[Damon Wayans]] in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', [[Halle Berry]] and [[Martin Lawrence]] in ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'', [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] in ''[[Coming to America]],'' [[Dave Chappelle]] in ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' and [[Chris Rock]] in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''.

Although Murphy has enjoyed commercial success since ''Saturday Night Live'', he did not participate in the making of the ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' retrospective book by [[Tom Shales]] and James Andrew Miller (2002), nor did he ever attend cast reunions or anniversary specials until his appearance on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)#Specials|''SNL'' 40th anniversary special]]. Murphy's box office results began to recover in 1996, starting with ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''.

===1998 to present===
He followed with a series of very successful family-friendly movies like ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'' and [[Dr. Dolittle 2|its sequel]], the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series, ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'', and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'', along with ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''. However, most of his movies meant for more adult audiences performed moderately; ''[[Metro (1997 film)|Metro]]'', ''[[I Spy (film)|I Spy]]'', and ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'' all grossed less than $40&nbsp;million domestically, ''[[Holy Man]]'' performed poorly, grossing less than $13&nbsp;million, and ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'' is on record as one of the biggest theatrical money-losers of all time, grossing just $7&nbsp;million worldwide on a reported $110&nbsp;million budget. A notable exception to this run of poorly received adult-themed films was the [[Frank Oz]] comedy ''[[Bowfinger]]'', also starring [[Steve Martin]]. The film garnered generally positive critical reviews, and grossed $98&nbsp;million at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bowfinger.htm |title=boxofficemojo.com: Bowfinger (1999) |publisher=boxofficemojo.com |date=June 19, 2007 |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref>

In 2006, he starred in the motion picture version of the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' as soul singer James "Thunder" Early. Murphy won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]], as well as a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] and a [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] Award in that category. Several reviews for the film highlighted Murphy's performance while he received some pre-release [[Academy Awards]] buzz.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/movies/03modd.html?_r=1&ref%3Dmovies&oref=slogin|title=Eddie Murphy Inspires Oscar Buzz.

In 2007, Murphy was invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=entertainment&id=5400194 |title=abc7.com: Film Academy Invites 115 New Members 6/19/07 |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=June 19, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> As a result of [[Viacom]]'s acquisition of [[DreamWorks]], Paramount distributed his other 2007 releases: ''[[Norbit]]'' and ''[[Shrek the Third]]''. He starred in the 2008 film ''[[Meet Dave]]'' and the 2009 film ''[[Imagine That (film)|Imagine That]]'' for Paramount Pictures.

Murphy co-starred in ''[[Tower Heist]]'', directed by [[Brett Ratner]]. Murphy played a thief who joins a group of hardworking men who find out they have fallen victim to a wealthy businessman's [[Ponzi scheme]], and conspire to rob his high-rise residence. [[Ben Stiller]], [[Matthew Broderick]], and [[Casey Affleck]] also starred in the film, released on November 4, 2011.<ref name="actors"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006200093,00.html|title=Eddie cops film No4|publisher=Sun Online | location=London|date=May 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2010/11/16/tower-heist-continues-filming-at-trump-international-hotel-tower |title='Tower Heist' continues filming at Trump International Hotel & Tower |publisher=On Location Vacations |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>

It was reported in 2011 that Murphy would host the [[84th Academy Awards]] in 2012. However, he dropped out of his hosting duties on November 9, 2011, in the wake of the [[Brett Ratner#Academy Awards|Brett Ratner scandal]].

In August 2005, Mitchell filed for divorce, citing "[[irreconcilable differences]]". The divorce was finalized on April 17, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/eddiemurphy.htm|title=Eddie Murphy and Nicole Mitchell Marriage|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>

As of 2008, Murphy resides in [[Long Island, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?Eddie_Murphys_bowling_bashes&in_article_id=394657&in_page_id=7&in_a_source=|title=Eddie Murphy Bowling Bashes|date=November 10, 2008|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref>

Following his divorce from Mitchell, in 2006, Murphy began dating former [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Melanie Brown]], who became pregnant and stated that the child was Murphy's. When questioned about the pregnancy in December 2006, by ''[[RTL Boulevard]],'' Murphy told [[Dutch people|Dutch]] reporter [[Matthijs Kleyn]], "I don't know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test. You shouldn't jump to conclusions, sir". Brown gave birth to a baby girl, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007. On June 22, 2007, representatives for Brown announced in ''[[People magazine|People]]'' that a [[DNA]] test had confirmed that Murphy was the father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20043487,00.html|title=Mel B Says DNA Proves Eddie Murphy Fathered Her Baby|work=People }}</ref> Brown had stated in an interview that Murphy has not sought a relationship with Angel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a101281/mel-b-writes-song-about-eddie-murphy.html |title=Mel B writes song about Eddie Murphy |publisher=Digital Spy |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/2011/11/03/20111103eddie-murphy-hasnt-had-drink-18-years.html |title=Eddie Murphy hasn't had a drink in 18 years |publisher=AZCentral.com |date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref> although it was later reported in 2010 that Murphy was getting to know her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/source-eddie-murphy-making-effort-daughter-ex-flame-melanie-brown-article-1.445721 |title=Source says Eddie Murphy making effort to get to know daughter he had with ex-flame Melanie Brown |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

Murphy exchanged marriage vows with film producer [[Tracey Edmonds]], former wife of [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], on January 1, 2008, in a private ceremony on an island off [[Bora Bora]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wihlborg |first=Ulrica |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20168679,00.html |title=Eddie Murphy and Tracey Edmonds Marry - Weddings, Eddie Murphy |publisher=People.com |date=2015-01-19 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> On January 16, 2008, the couple released a statement saying, "After much consideration and discussion, we have jointly decided that we will forgo having a legal ceremony as it is not necessary to define our relationship further," and called the Bora Bora wedding a "symbolic union". The two had planned on having a legal ceremony upon their return to the U.S. but did not, and their wedding was never official.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/01/16/UPI-93551200527714/ |title=Murphy, Edmonds splitting up|publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]] | date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

It is assumed that he and Tracy Edmonds broke up at some point, as Eddie Murphy began dating Paige Butcher in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/05/paige-butcher-bikini_n_5097614.html |title=Eddie Murphy with Paige Butcher|publisher=Huffington post |date=April 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Lawsuit===

In 1988 [[Art Buchwald]] sued Murphy and Paramount Pictures, alleging that they had used ideas from a screenplay he had submitted to Paramount as the basis for Murphy's film ''[[Coming to America]]''.  In 1992 Buchwald was awarded $150,000 in a summary judgment; Buchwald's producing partner, Alan Bernheim, was awarded $750,000.  Both sides described the outcome as a "victory".<ref>Art Buchwald Awarded $150,000 in Suit Over Film (March 17, 1992).

===Legal Issues===

In May 1997, Murphy was stopped by police after having been observed picking up a transvestite prostitute in his car. The prostitute, Atisone Seuli, was arrested on an outstanding warrant for prostitution. Murphy was not arrested or charged and claimed he was just giving Seuli a ride.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9705/02/murphy/</ref>

===Philanthropy===
Murphy has donated money to the AIDS Foundation, and cancer, education, creative arts, family/parent support, health and homeless charities. He has donated to the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site|Martin Luther King Jr. Center]], various cancer charities and $100,000 to the [[Screen Actors' Guild]]'s strike relief fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/194-eddie-murphy |title=Eddie Murphy's Charity Work |publisher=Looktothestars.org |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>
