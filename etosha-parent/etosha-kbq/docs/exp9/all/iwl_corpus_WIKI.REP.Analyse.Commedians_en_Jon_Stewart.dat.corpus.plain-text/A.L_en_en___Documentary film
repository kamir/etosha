A '''documentary film''' is a [[nonfiction]]al [[motion picture]] intended to [[Wikt:document#Verb|document]] some aspect of reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction or maintaining a historical record.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/56332 oed.com]</ref> Such films were originally shot on [[film stock]]—the only medium available—but now includes [[video]] and [[new media|digital]] productions that can be either [[direct-to-video]], made into a TV show or released for screening in cinemas. "Documentary" has been described as a "filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries.<ref>Nichols, Bill. 'Foreword', in Barry Keith Grant and Jeannette Sloniowski (eds.) ''Documenting The Documentary: Close Readings of Documentary Film and Video''. Detroit: [[Wayne State University Press]], 1997</ref>

== Defining ''documentary'' ==
In popular myth, the word ''documentary'' was coined by Scottish documentarian [[John Grierson]] in his review of [[Robert Flaherty]]'s film ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]'' (1926), published in the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' on 8 February 1926, written by "The Moviegoer" (a pen name for Grierson).<ref name=RFL>Ann Curthoys, Marilyn Lake [http://books.google.com/books?id=JE6YM8jcRucC&pg=PA151&dq=john+grierson+documentary+1926&hl=en&ei=5wkUTcb5OMq7hAeixPW2Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=john%20grierson%20documentary%201926&f=false Connected worlds: history in transnational perspective, Volume 2004] p.151. Australian National University Press</ref>

Grierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the "original" actor and "original" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials "thus taken from the raw" can be more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's definition of documentary as "creative treatment of actuality"<ref>[http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/hfilm/MORRIS.html Re-Thinking Grierson: The Ideology of John Grierson]</ref> has gained some acceptance, with this position at variance with Soviet film-maker [[Dziga Vertov]]'s provocation to present "life as it is" (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and "life caught unawares" (life provoked or surprised by the camera).

The American film critic [[Pare Lorentz]] defines a documentary film as "a factual film which is dramatic."<ref>[http://parelorentzcenter.net/fdr_film.php Pare Lorentz Film Library – FDR and Film]</ref> Others further state that a documentary stands out from the other types of non-fiction films for providing an opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it presents.<ref>{{Cite journal

[[Documentary practice]] is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.

There are clear connections in terms of practice with magazine and newspaper feature-writing and indeed to non-fiction literature. Many of the generic forms of documentary, for example the biopic or profile; or the observational piece. These generic forms are explored on the University of Winchester Journalism Department 'features web' where 'long form journalism' is classified by genre or content, rather than in terms of production as film, radio or 'print'.<ref>[http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=299 University of Winchester Journalism Department – Feature Writing and Documentary Making]</ref>

==History==

===Pre-1900===

Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called "actuality" films; the term "documentary" was not coined until 1926.  Many of the first films, such as those made by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations.

Films showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]''. Using pioneering film-looping technology, [[Enoch J. Rector]] presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.

The French surgeon [[Eugène-Louis Doyen]] started a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898. Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. As Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906 Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series ''Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées'' (1906), and the four-film ''Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne'' (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.<ref>''Journal of Film Preservation'', nr. 70, November 2005.</ref>

[[File:Gheorghe Marinescu - Science films.jpg|thumb|right|Frame from one of [[Gheorghe Marinescu|Marinescu's]] science films (1899).]]
Between July 1898 and 1901 the [[Romania]]n professor [[Gheorghe Marinescu]] made several science films in his [[neurology]] clinic in [[Bucharest]]:<ref name="marin1">[[Mircea Dumitrescu]], ''O privire critică asupra filmului românesc'', [[Brașov]], 2005, ISBN 978-973-9153-93-5</ref> ''[[Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy|The walking troubles of organic hemiplegy]]'' (1898), ''The walking troubles of organic paraplegies'' (1899), ''A case of hysteric hemiplegy healed through hypnosis'' (1899), ''The walking troubles of progressive locomotion ataxy'' (1900) and ''Illnesses of the muscles'' (1901). All these short films have been preserved. The professor called his works "studies with the help of the cinematograph," and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of "La Semaine Médicale" magazine from [[Paris]], between 1899 and 1902.<ref name="marin2">Rîpeanu, Bujor T. ''Filmul documentar 1897–1948'', Bucharest, 2008, ISBN 978-973-7839-40-4</ref> In 1924, Auguste Lumiere recognized the merits of Marinescu's science films: "I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving "La Semaine Médicale," but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way."<ref name="marin3">Ţuţui, Marian, ''[http://www.cncinema.abt.ro/Files/Documents/fls-258.doc A short history of the Romanian films]'' at the Romanian National Cinematographic Center. {{Wayback|url=http://www.cncinema.abt.ro/Files/Documents/fls-258.doc|date =20080411014620}}</ref><ref name="marinescupathe">[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=71342 The Works of Gheorghe Marinescu], 1967 report.</ref><ref name="marinescuanf">[http://www.cncinema.abt.ro/Files/Movies/fls-271.avi Excerpts of prof. dr.

===1900–1920===
[[Travelogue (films)|Travelogue films]] were very popular in the early part of the 20th century. They were often referred to by distributors as "scenics." Scenics were among the most popular sort of films at the time.<ref>[[Miriam Hansen]], ''Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film'', 2005.</ref> An important early film to move beyond the concept of the scenic was ''[[In the Land of the Head Hunters]]'' (1914), which embraced [[primitivism]] and [[exoticism]] in a staged story presented as truthful re-enactments of the life of [[First Nations|Native Americans]].

Contemplation is a separate area. [[Pathé]] is the best-known global manufacturer of such films of the early 20th century. A vivid example is [[Moscow clad in snow]] (1909).

Biographical documentaries appeared during this time, such as the feature ''[[Eminescu-Veronica-Creangă]]'' (1914) on the relationship between the writers [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Veronica Micle]] and [[Ion Creangă]] (all deceased at the time of the production) released by the [[Bucharest]] chapter of [[Pathé]].

Early color motion picture processes such as [[Kinemacolor]]—known for the feature ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' (1912)—and [[Prizma]]color—known for ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and the five-reel feature ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921)—used travelogues to promote the new color processes. In contrast, [[Technicolor]] concentrated primarily on getting their process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.

Also during this period, [[Frank Hurley]]'s feature documentary film, ''South'' (1919), about the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] was released. The film documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1914.

===1920s===

====Romanticism====
[[File:Nanook of the north.jpg|thumb|[[Nanook of the North]] poster.]]
With [[Robert J. Flaherty]]'s ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' in 1922, documentary film embraced [[romanticism]]; Flaherty filmed a number of heavily staged romantic films during this time period, often showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then. For instance, in ''Nanook of the North'' Flaherty did not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless [[igloo]] for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.

[[Paramount Pictures]] tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's ''Nanook'' and ''Moana'' with two romanticized documentaries, ''[[Grass (1925 film)|Grass]]'' (1925) and ''[[Chang (film)|Chang]]'' (1927), both directed by [[Merian Cooper]] and [[Ernest Schoedsack]].

====The city symphony====
[[Image:Mikhail kaufman on train.jpg|thumb|In this shot from [[Man with the Movie Camera]], [[Mikhail Kaufman]] acts as a cameraman risking his life in search of the best shot]]
The continental, or realist, tradition focused on humans within human-made environments, and included the so-called "city symphony" films such as [[Walter Ruttmann]]'s ''[[Berlin, Symphony of a City]]'' (of which Grierson noted in an article<ref>Grierson, John. 'First Principles of Documentary', in Kevin Macdonald & Mark Cousins (eds.) Imagining Reality: The Faber Book of Documentary. London: Faber and Faber, 1996</ref> that ''Berlin'' represented what a documentary should '''not''' be), [[Alberto Cavalcanti]]'s ''[[Rien que les heures]]'', and [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''[[Man with the Movie Camera]]''. These films tend to feature people as products of their environment, and lean towards the avant-garde.

====''Kino-Pravda''====
[[Dziga Vertov]] was central to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'' (literally, "cinematic truth") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov believed the camera—with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing, time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion—could render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film philosophy out of it.

====Newsreel tradition ====
The [[newsreel]] tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them.

===1920s–1940s===
The propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most celebrated and controversial [[propaganda film]]s is [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), which chronicled the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Congress]] and was commissioned by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Leftist filmmakers [[Joris Ivens]] and [[Henri Storck]] directed ''[[Borinage]]'' (1931) about the Belgian coal mining region. [[Luis Buñuel]] directed a "[[surrealism|surrealist]]" documentary ''[[Land Without Bread|Las Hurdes]]'' (1933).

[[Pare Lorentz]]'s ''[[The Plow That Broke the Plains]]'' (1936) and ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'' (1938) and [[Willard Van Dyke]]'s ''[[The City (1939 film)|The City]]'' (1939) are notable [[New Deal]] productions, each presenting complex combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda, and leftist viewpoints. [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' (1942–1944) series was a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war. [[Constance Bennett]] and her husband [[Henri de la Falaise]] produced two feature-length documentaries, ''[[Legong: Dance of the Virgins]]'' (1935) filmed in [[Bali]], and ''Kilou the Killer Tiger'' (1936) filmed in [[Indochina]].

In Canada the [[National Film Board of Canada|Film Board]], set up by John Grierson, was created for the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the psychological warfare of [[Nazi]] Germany (orchestrated by [[Joseph Goebbels]]).

[[File:Basil Wright, Joris Ivens, Elmar Klos i Jerzy Toeplitz - Film nr 55-56 - 1948-12-23.JPG|thumb|Conference of "World Union of documentary films" in 1948 Warsaw featured famous directors of the era: [[Basil Wright]] (on the left), [[Elmar Klos]], [[Joris Ivens]] (2nd from the right) and [[Jerzy Toeplitz]].]]
In Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under John Grierson. They became known as the [[Documentary Film Movement]]. Grierson, [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], [[Basil Wright]], and [[Humphrey Jennings]] amongst others succeeded in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include ''Drifters'' ([[John Grierson]]), ''[[Song of Ceylon]]'' ([[Basil Wright]]), ''[[Fires Were Started]]'' and ''[[A Diary for Timothy]]'' ([[Humphrey Jennings]]). Their work involved poets such as [[W. H. Auden]], composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]], and writers such as [[J. B. Priestley]]. Among the best known films of the movement are ''[[Night Mail]]'' and ''[[Coal Face]]''.

===1950s–1970s===

====Cinéma-vérité ====
[[Cinéma vérité]] (or the closely related [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]]) was dependent on some technical advances in order to exist: light, quiet and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.

Cinéma vérité and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also happen in the [[French New Wave]], the filmmakers taking advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.

Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cinéma vérité ([[Jean Rouch]]) and the North American "[[Direct Cinema]]" (or more accurately "[[:fr:Cinéma direct|Cinéma direct]]"), pioneered by, among others, Canadians [[Allan King]], [[:fr:Michel Brault|Michel Brault]] and [[Pierre Perrault]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and Americans [[Robert Drew]], [[Richard Leacock]], [[Frederick Wiseman]] and [[Albert and David Maysles]].

The directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement with their subjects. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault, Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.

The films ''[[Primary (film)|Primary]]'' and ''[[Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment]]'' (both produced by [[Robert Drew]]), ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'' (directed by [[Barbara Kopple]]), ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' ([[D. A. Pennebaker]]), ''[[Lonely Boy (film)|Lonely Boy]]'' ([[Wolf Koenig]] and [[Roman Kroitor]]) are all frequently deemed [[cinéma vérité]] films.

The fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the [[shooting ratio]] (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement—such as [[Werner Nold]], Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, [[Susan Froemke]], and Ellen Hovde—are often overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were often given co-director credits.

Famous cinéma vérité/direct cinema films include ''[[Les Raquetteurs]]'',<ref>[http://www.nfb.ca/trouverunfilm/fichefilm.php?id=54008&v=h&lg=en Les raquetteurs – NFB – Collection]</ref> ''Showman'', ''[[Salesman (film)|Salesman]]'', ''Near Death'', ''The Children Were Watching'', and ''Grey Gardens''.

====Political weapons====
In the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against [[neocolonialism]] and [[capitalism]] in general, especially in [[Latin America]], but also in a changing [[Quebec]] society. ''La Hora de los hornos'' (''[[The Hour of the Furnaces]]'', from 1968), directed by [[Octavio Getino]] and [[Arnold Vincent Kudales Sr.]], influenced a whole generation of filmmakers. Among the many political documentaries produced in the early 1970s was "Chile: A Special Report," public television's first in-depth expository look of the September 1973 overthrow of the [[Salvador Allende]] government in [[Chile]] by military leaders under [[Augusto Pinochet]], produced by documentarians Ari Martinez and José Garcia.

===Modern documentaries===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VoicesOfIraq.jpg|thumb|215px|One of 150 DV cameras used by Iraqis to film themselves and create the 2004  film ''[[Voices of Iraq]]''.]] -->
[[Box office]] analysts have noted that this film genre has become increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[Food, Inc.]]'', ''[[Earth (2009 film)|Earth]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', ''[[Religulous]]'', and ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' among the most prominent examples. Compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets which makes them attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release can be highly profitable.

The nature of documentary films has expanded in the past 20 years from the cinema verité style introduced in the 1960s in which the use of portable camera and sound equipment allowed an intimate relationship between filmmaker and subject. The line blurs between documentary and narrative and some works are very personal, such as the late [[Marlon Riggs]]'s ''Tongues Untied'' (1989) and ''Black Is...Black Ain't'' (1995), which mix expressive, poetic, and rhetorical elements and stresses subjectivities rather than historical materials.<ref>Struggles for Representation African American Documentary Film and Video, edited by Phyllis R. Klotman and Janet K. Cutler,</ref>

Historical documentaries, such as the landmark 14-hour ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]: America's Civil Rights Years'' (1986—Part 1 and 1989—Part 2) by Henry Hampton, ''[[Four Little Girls]]'' (1997) by [[Spike Lee]], and ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' by [[Ken Burns]], UNESCO awarded independent film on slavery [[500 Years Later]], expressed not only a distinctive voice but also a perspective and point of views. Some films such as ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' by [[Errol Morris]] incorporated stylized re-enactments, and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Roger & Me]]'' placed far more interpretive control with the director. The commercial success of these documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as "[[mondo films]]" or "docu-ganda."<ref name="csm">{{cite news

}}</ref> However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form due to problematic ontological foundations.

Although documentaries are financially more viable with the increasing popularity of the genre and the advent of the [[DVD]], funding for documentary film production remains elusive. Within the past decade the largest exhibition opportunities have emerged from within the broadcast market, making filmmakers beholden to the tastes and influences of the broadcasters who have become their largest funding source.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070519040840/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/fes_01Sund_010208_Docs.html indiewire.com], "Festivals: Post-Sundance 2001; Docs Still Face Financing and Distribution Challenges."

Modern documentaries have some overlap with television forms, with the development of "''[[reality television]]''" that occasionally verges on the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged. The ''making-of'' documentary shows how a [[Film|movie]] or a [[video game|computer game]] was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is closer to an advertisement than a classic documentary.

Modern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in equipment prices. The first film to take full advantage of this change was [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', where 150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq during the war and passed out to Iraqis to record themselves.

====Documentaries without words====
Films in the documentary form without words have been made. From 1982, the [[Qatsi trilogy]] and the similar ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' could be described as visual tone poems, with music related to the images, but no spoken content. ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' (part of the Qatsi trilogy) consists primarily of [[slow motion]] and [[time-lapse photography]] of cities and many natural landscapes across the [[United States]]. ''Baraka'' tries to capture the great pulse of humanity as it flocks and swarms in daily activity and religious ceremonies.

''[[Bodysong]]'' was made in 2003 and won a British Independent Film Award for "Best British Documentary."

The 2004 film ''[[Genesis (2004 film)|Genesis]]'' shows animal and plant life in states of expansion, decay, sex, and death, with some, but little, narration.

==== Narration styles ====
; Voice-over narrator
The traditional style for narration is to have a dedicated narrator read a script which is dubbed onto the audio track.   The narrator never appears on camera and may not necessarily have knowledge of the subject matter or involvement in the writing of the script.  
; Silent narration
This style of narration uses title screens to visually narrate the documentary.  The screens are held for about 5–10 seconds to allow adequate time for the viewer to read them.  They are similar to the ones shown at the end of movies based on true stories, but they are shown throughout, typically between scenes.
; Hosted narrator
In this style, there is a host who appears on camera, conducts interviews, and who also does voice-overs.

==Other documentary forms==

===Docufiction===
[[Docufiction]] is a [[Wiktionary:hybrid|hybrid]] [[genre]] from two basic ones, [[fiction film]] and [[documentary]], practiced since the first   documentary films were made.

===Docu-eroticamentary===
[[Docu-eroticamentary]] is a [[Wiktionary:hybrid|hybrid]] [[genre]] from two basic ones, [[erotica]] or [[Romance film|romance]] and documentary, the term coined by docu-eroticamentary author Gwendolyn Olmsted, from publisher AuthorHouse's  ''Eight Weeks in May'', and Part II of that book through publisher Amazon's  ''The January Cruise''.

===DVD documentary===
A DVD documentary, is a documentary film of indeterminate length, that has been produced with the sole intent of releasing it for direct sale to the public on [[DVD]](s), as different from a documentary being made and released first on [[television]] or on a cinema screen (a.k.a. [[Film release|theatrical release]]) and subsequently on DVD for public consumption.

This form of documentary release is becoming more popular and accepted as costs and difficulty with finding TV or theatrical release slots increases.  It is also commonly used for more 'specialist' documentaries, which might not have general interest to a wider TV audience.  Examples are military, cultural arts, transport, sports, etc..

===Compilation films===
Compilation films were pioneered in 1927 by [[Esfir Shub|Esfir Schub]] with ''The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty''. More recent examples include ''[[Point of Order (film)|Point of Order]]'' (1964), directed by [[Emile de Antonio]] about the McCarthy hearings, and ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'' which is made entirely out of found footage that various agencies of the U.S. government made about the safety of nuclear radiation (for example, telling troops at one point that it is safe to be irradiated as long as they keep their eyes and mouths shut). Similarly, ''[[The Last Cigarette]]'' combines the testimony of various [[tobacco]] company executives before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking1.

Poetic documentaries, which first appeared in the 1920s, were a sort of reaction against both the content and the rapidly crystallizing grammar of the early fiction film. The poetic mode moved away from continuity editing and instead organized images of the material world by means of associations and patterns, both in terms of time and space. Well-rounded characters—"lifelike people"—were absent; instead, people appeared in these films as entities, just like any other, that are found in the material world. The films were fragmentary, impressionistic, lyrical. Their disruption of the coherence of time and space—a coherence favored by the fiction films of the day—can also be seen as an element of the modernist counter-model of cinematic narrative. The "real world"—Nichols calls it the "historical world"—was broken up into fragments and aesthetically reconstituted using film form. Examples of this style include Joris Ivens' ''Rain'' (1928), which records a passing summer shower over Amsterdam; László Moholy-Nagy's ''Play of Light: Black, White, Grey (1930)'', in which he films one of his own kinetic sculptures, emphasizing not the sculpture itself but the play of light around it; Oskar Fischinger's abstract animated films; Francis Thompson's ''N.Y., N.Y.'' (1957), a city symphony film; and Chris Marker's ''Sans Soleil'' (1982).

Expository documentaries speak directly to the viewer, often in the form of an authoritative commentary employing voiceover or titles, proposing a strong argument and point of view. These films are rhetorical, and try to persuade the viewer. (They may use a rich and sonorous male voice.) The (voice-of-God) commentary often sounds 'objective' and omniscient. Images are often not paramount; they exist to advance the argument. The rhetoric insistently presses upon us to read the images in a certain fashion. Historical documentaries in this mode deliver an unproblematic and 'objective' account and interpretation of past events.

Examples: TV shows and films like A&E Biography; America's Most Wanted; many science and nature documentaries; Ken Burns' The Civil War (1990); Robert Hughes' The Shock of the New (1980); John Berger's Ways Of Seeing (1974). Also, Frank Capra's wartime Why We Fight series; Pare Lorentz's The Plow That Broke The Plains (1936)

===Observational documentaries===
Observational documentaries attempt to simply and spontaneously observe lived life with a minimum of intervention. Filmmakers who worked in this subgenre often saw the poetic mode as too abstract and the expository mode as too didactic. The first observational docs date back to the 1960s; the technological developments which made them possible include mobile lighweight cameras and portable sound recording equipment for synchronized sound. Often, this mode of film eschewed voice-over commentary, post-synchronized dialogue and music, or re-enactments. The films aimed for immediacy, intimacy, and revelation of individual human character in ordinary life situations.

===Types of documentaries===

'''Participatory documentaries''' believe that it is impossible for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also get a sense of how situations in the film are affected or altered by her presence. Nichols: "The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (almost) like any other. (Almost like any other because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)" The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cinéma vérité, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the "truth" refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.

'''Reflexive documentaries''' do not see themselves as a transparent window on the world; instead they draw attention to their own constructedness, and the fact that they are representations. How does the world get represented by documentary films? This question is central to this subgenre of films. They prompt us to "question the authenticity of documentary in general." It is the most self-conscious of all the modes, and is highly skeptical of 'realism.' It may use Brechtian alienation strategies to jar us, in order to 'defamiliarize' what we are seeing and how we are seeing it.

'''Performative documentaries''' stress subjective experience and emotional response to the world. They are strongly personal, unconventional, perhaps poetic and/or experimental, and might include hypothetical enactments of events designed to make us experience what it might be like for us to possess a certain specific perspective on the world that is not our own, e.g. that of black, gay men in Marlon Riggs's Tongues Untied (1989) or Jenny Livingston's Paris Is Burning (1991). This subgenre might also lend itself to certain groups (e.g. women, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, etc.) to 'speak about themselves.' Often, a battery of techniques, many borrowed from fiction or avant-garde films, are used. Performative docs often link up personal accounts or experiences with larger political or historical realities.

==Translation of documentaries==

There are several challenges associated with translation of documentaries, the main two are: working conditions and problems with terminology.

===Working conditions===

Documentary translators very often have to meet tight deadlines. Normally, the translator has between five and seven days to hand over the translation of a 90-minute programme. Dubbing studios typically give translators a week to translate a documentary, but in order to earn a good salary translators have to deliver their translations in a much shorter period, usually when the studio decides to deliver the final programme to the client sooner or when the broadcasting channel sets a tight deadline, e.g. on documentaries discussing the latest news.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 110-111.</ref>

Another problem is the lack of postproduction script or the poor quality of the transcription. A correct transcription is essential for a translator to do their work properly, however many times the script is not even given to the translator, which is a major impediment since documentaries are characterised by “the abundance of terminological units and very specific proper names”.<ref name="Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120">Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 111</ref> When the script is given to the translator, it is usually poorly transcribed or outright incorrect making the translation unnecessary difficult and demanding because all of the proper names and specific terminology have to be correct in a documentary programme in order for it to be a reliable source of information, hence the translator has to check every term on their own. Such mistakes in proper names are for instance: “Jungle Reinhard instead of Django Reinhart, Jorn Asten instead of Jane Austen and Magnus Axle instead of Aldous Huxley”.<ref name="Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120"/>

===Terminology===

The process of translation of a documentary programme requires working with very specific, often scientific terminology. Documentary translators usually are not specialist in a given field, therefore they are compelled to undertake extensive research whenever asked to make a translation of a specific documentary programme in order to understand it correctly and deliver the final product free of mistakes and inaccuracies. Generally, documentaries contain a large amount of specific terms, with which translators have to familiarise themselves on their own, for example:

<blockquote>
The documentary ''Beetles, Record Breakers'' makes use of 15 different terms to refer to beetles in less than 30 minutes (longhorn beetle, cellar beetle, stag beetle, burying beetle or gravediggers, sexton beetle, tiger beetle, bloody nose beetle, tortoise beetle, diving beetle, devil’s coach horse, weevil, click beetle, malachite beetle, oil beetle, cockchafer), apart from mentioning other animals such as horseshoe bats or meadow brown butterflies.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113</ref>
</blockquote>

This poses a real challenge for the translators because they have to render the meaning, i.e. find an equivalent, of a very specific, scientific term in the target language and frequently the narrator uses a more general name instead of a specific term and the translator has to rely on the image presented in the programme to understand which term is being discussed in order to transpose it in the target language accordingly.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113-114</ref> Additionally, translators of minorised languages often have to face another problem: some terms may not even exist in the target language. In such case they have to create new terminology or consult specialists to find proper solutions. Also, sometimes the official nomenclature differs from the terminology used by actual specialists, which leaves the translator to decide between using the official vocabulary that can be found in the dictionary, or rather opting for spontaneous expressions used by real experts in real situations.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 114-115</ref>
