'''James Thomas''' "'''Jimmy'''" '''Fallon<!--- no evidence of "Jr." --->''' (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, television host, actor, musician, writer, and producer. He is best known for his work in television as a [[cast member]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and as the host of [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]''. Born in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn]] and raised in [[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties, New York]], Fallon's upbringing was idyllic. He grew up with an interest in comedy and music, moving to [[Los Angeles]] at 21 to pursue stand-up opportunities.

He was commissioned to join [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Fallon remained on ''SNL'' for six years between 1998 and 2004, co-hosting the program's [[Weekend Update]] sketch and becoming a celebrity in the process. He left the program for the film industry, starring in movies such as ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005), which were mostly unsuccessful. Following a dismal acting career, Fallon returned to television as the host of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on NBC in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and games. He transitioned from that program to become the sixth host of the long-running ''[[Tonight Show]]'' in 2014.

In addition to his television work, Fallon has released two comedy albums and several books.

Fallon landed his second audition at the age of 23. At the "notoriously difficult audition,"<ref name="VF1"/> he was told by multiple individuals that creator [[Lorne Michaels]] almost never emitted laughter during auditions.

===''Saturday Night Live'' years (1998–2004)===

====Early seasons (1998–2000)====
Fallon debuted on ''Saturday Night Live'' as a featured player at the beginning of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 24)|twenty-fourth season]] in September 1998.<ref>No byline (August 29, 2002), "Jimmy Fallon is here on MTV, there on 'SNL' and ...". ''USA Today''.</ref> He became a star by his fourth episode, when he performed [[Halloween]]-themed versions of songs by popular artists, as well as his Sandler impression.<ref name=rs/> His sudden popularity made Fallon a celebrity, where he was considered both charming and a [[sex symbol]].<ref name="usa04"/> Fallon possessed a strong female fan-base, receiving numerous letters from fans and becoming the subject of numerous fan-sites.<ref name="NYMagazine"/> He became the program's most featured mimic, with popular impressions of [[Robert De Niro]], Jerry Seinfeld, and [[Howard Stern]]. In additional, he also starred as many original characters, including [[Nick Burns (character)|Nick Burns]], a [[IT Support]] nerd, and in [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 2000–2001#Jarret's Room|Jerrett's Room]], a fictional [[webcast]] hosted by [[stoner]] college students Jerrett (Fallon) and Gobi ([[Horatio Sanz]]).

He was promoted to repertory player in his second season.<ref name="NYMagazine"/> In his off time, Fallon released a book comprising e-mail exchanges with his sister, titled ''I Hate This Place: A Pessimist's Guide to Life'' (1999), and filmed a minor role for the film ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000).<ref name="NYMagazine"/> During their time at ''SNL'', Fallon and fellow cast member Horatio Sanz often partied. These experiences were an extension of their desires to emulate the ''SNL'' stars before them, including John Belushi, Adam Sandler, and [[Chris Farley]]. Sanz has described he and Fallon as "super-functioning alcoholics," often spotted at Siberia, an underground dive bar in the 50th Street subway station, or Niagara in the East Village.<ref name="vul2014"/> For example, on one occasion, they spent a Friday night watching [[the Strokes]] perform a midnight show, staying up until the early morning drinking, despite having to do ''SNL'' that night.<ref name="39vul">{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-host-hang-out-things-you-learn.html|title=39 Things You Learn About Jimmy Fallon by Hanging Out With Him|author= Jada Yuan|date=February 18, 2014|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> "We actually took what we thought being on SNL was, what people think is awesome about it, and we made it happen," said Sanz,<ref name="39vul"/> who noted that he and Fallon got in more than a few bar fights.<ref name="vul2014"/>

====Later years (2001–04)====
Fallon initially envisioned he would spend three years at ''SNL'', like Belushi, but he was persuaded to stay on for an additional three when given the reins to [[Weekend Update]] (which he would co-host with writer [[Tina Fey]]).<ref name="vul2014">{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-interview.html|title=Last Night With Jimmy Fallon: Into the Wee Hours With the Heir to TV’s Grandest Franchise|author= Jada Yuan|date=February 2, 2014|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>Wolk, Josh (October 13, 2000), "2 'LIVE' CREW".

Fallon became well known for his tendency to [[break character]] in sketches, an attribute he himself, as well Michaels, disliked.<ref name="GQ"/> It began in the infamous "[[More cowbell]]" sketch, when [[Will Ferrell]] wore a tighter shirt than expected, causing Fallon to crack up. Following this, other cast members would intentionally try to get Fallon to break.<ref name=rs/> Ferrell did this by squeezing his leg underneath the water in a hot tub sketch.<ref name=rs/> Critics derided this tendency as an example of a secretly smug persona, or how unprofessional he was.<ref name="NYM"/> Other cast members believed he was attempting to steal the moment, to make the sketch about himself. The joke became near-constant during Fallon's final year on the show.<ref name=rs/> During this time, Fallon parlayed his ''SNL'' success into co-hosting the [[2001 MTV Movie Awards]]<ref>Souter, Ericka (June 11, 2001), "talking with...Jimmy Fallon".

===Movie career (2004–08)===
[[File:Jimmy Fallon by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Fallon in 2007.]]
Fallon began to pursue a movie career beginning in 2004. He had spurned most major roles due to lack of time and disinterest in the dozens of scripts he read.<ref name="usa04"/> He signed on for his first lead role in ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'', a remake of a French film. Fallon had read the script in the prior years but became more interested when co-star [[Queen Latifah]] became attached to the project. He was also attracted to the film's [[action comedy]] tone, seeing comparisons with ''SNL'' alumnus [[Eddie Murphy]]'s first big film, ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name="IGN">{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/07/interview-jimmy-fallon|title=Interview: Jimmy Fallon|author=Steve Head|date=October 7, 2004|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> He split his time in the fall of 2003 between shooting the film in Los Angeles and returning to New York for ''SNL''.<ref name="usa04"/> Due to these conflicts (and his contract ending), his sixth season at ''SNL'' was his final, with Fallon signing off at the conclusion of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 29)|twenty-ninth season]] in May 2004.<ref name="people1">{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fallon Signs Off from SNL For Good|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,638549,00.html|date=May 17, 2004|author=Stephen M.

With big expectations from the studio, ''Taxi'' premiered in the fall of 2004 and was a flop with critics and audiences, resulting in Fallon's first failure.<ref name=rs/> [[20th Century Fox]] had already signed him on for his second major role, starring opposite [[Drew Barrymore]] 2005's [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'', before ''Taxi'' was unsuccessful.<ref name="usa04"/> ''Fever Pitch'' did not do much better, receiving mild reviews and tepid box office returns.<ref name="ew"/> He met his wife, producer Nancy Juvonen, during production of the film and the two wed in December 2007. Film offers decreased, with his two chances for major films both considered failures. Subsequently, Fallon went through what he has deemed a "lost period," characterized by a larger-than-usual alcohol consumption and confusion over his next career moves.<ref name="VF"/> He wrote a screenplay during this time "about a guy in a goth band who has to pretend to be a country-music star."<ref name=rs/> Following his failure in film, Fallon moved back East to New York, spending "a couple of years aimlessly knocking around."<ref name="vul2014"/>

Prior to leaving ''SNL'', Michaels had mentioned to Fallon that he would be a good fit to take over NBC's ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' franchise when then-host [[Conan O'Brien]] would depart the show to host the long-running ''[[Tonight Show]]'' in the future.

===Back to television and ''Late Night'' (2009–13)===
[[File:Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Barack Obama, Memorial Hall, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, April 24, 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Fallon interviewing President [[Barack Obama]] on the campus of [[UNC at Chapel Hill]] in April 2012.]]
''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' premiered in March 2009 to mixed reviews. In discovering the show's style, it took much less time than his predecessor. Producer Michael Shoemaker felt that it solidified when the show used [[Susan Boyle]] as a joke. While other late-night programs had centered on her appearance, Fallon's ''Late Night'' debuted a sketch in which Boyle's emotional performances could "salve any affliction."<ref name="NYM"/>  It was this style of humor, that Adam Sternbergh of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' dubbed "the comedy of unabashed celebration,"<ref name="NYM"/> that led to the program's success.

Fallon proved himself different than other late-night hosts, with more of a reliance on music, dancing, impersonations, and games.<ref name=rs>{{cite journal| author=Brian Hiatt| date =January 20, 2011| title =Jimmy Fallon's Big Adventure| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | issue =1122 | page = | publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jimmy-fallons-big-adventure-20110120 | accessdate =May 5, 2015}}</ref> Between Fallon's own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his [[house band]], hip-hop collective [[The Roots]], his incarnation of ''Late Night'' "evolved into the most deeply musical of TV’s musical-comedy variety programs", with sketches in which he parodies [[Neil Young]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] going viral online.<ref name="VF" /> Coincidentally, it was during the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|''Tonight Show'' debacle]] that Fallon's show found its footing.<ref name="VF" /> Another component built into the program was its association with [[social media]] and the Internet.
