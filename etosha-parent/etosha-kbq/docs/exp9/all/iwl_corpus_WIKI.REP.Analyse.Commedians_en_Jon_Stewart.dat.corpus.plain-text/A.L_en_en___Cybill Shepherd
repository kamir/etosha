==Early life==
Shepherd was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the daughter of Patty (née Shobe), a homemaker, and William Jennings Shepherd, who managed a home appliance business.<ref name=filmr>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/78/Cybill-Shepherd.html |title=Cybill Shepherd Biography (1950-) |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> Named after her grandfather Cy and her father Bill, Shepherd won the 1966 "Miss Teenage Memphis" contest at age 16, and the 1968 "Model of the Year" contest at age 18, making her a fashion star of the 1960s, resulting in fashion modeling work through high school and after.<ref>{{cite web|author=UPI|date=August 20, 1973|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AeEeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y2YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4779,2209579&dq=cybill+shepherd+successful-model&hl=en|title=Cybill Shepherd relaxes with her success|work= [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref>

==Career==
According to Shepherd's autobiography, it was a 1970 ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine cover that caught the eye of film director [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. His then-wife, [[Polly Platt]], claimed that it was she who, upon seeing the cover in a check-out line in a [[Ralphs]] grocery store in southern California, said "That's Jacy,"<ref>Polly Platt talks about the magazine cover discovery in the film documentary based on the [[Peter Biskind]] book, [[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]].</ref> referring to the role Bogdanovich was casting—and ultimately offered to Shepherd—in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971). She became intimately involved with him, as well as co-star [[Jeff Bridges]], screenwriter [[Larry McMurtry]], and then location manager [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]].<ref>http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/television/cybill-at-liberty/story-e6frf9ho-1111117185046</ref>

===First experience of fame===
Her first film was ''The Last Picture Show'' (1971 film), also starring [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Timothy Bottoms]]. The film became a critical and box office hit, earning several Academy Awards and nominations. Shepherd was nominated for a Golden Globe. Shepherd was cast opposite [[Charles Grodin]] in ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]'' (1972). She played Kelly, the beautiful, sunkissed young woman whom Grodin's character falls for while on his honeymoon in Miami. Directed by [[Elaine May]], it was another critical and box office hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/heartbreak_kid/|title=The Heartbreak Kid (1972)&nbsp;— Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref>
Also in 1972, Shepherd posed as a [[Kodak]] Girl for the [[camera]] manufacturer's then ubiquitous cardboard displays.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nancy Martha West|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nuae4VHlyrYC&lpg=PA53&dq=cybill%20shepherd%20kodak&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q=cybill%20shepherd%20kodak&f=false|title=Kodak and the Lens of Nostaglia London: University Press of Virginia, 2000, p. 53. ISBN 0-8139-1959-2|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref>

In 1974, Shepherd released her debut studio album ''Cybill Does It...To Cole Porter'' for MCA Records<ref name="Cybill Shepherd Music Discography">{{cite web|url=http://cybillshepherd.co.uk/discography.htm |title=Cybill Shepherd Music Discography |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref> and again teamed with Peter Bogdanovich for the title role in ''[[Daisy Miller (1974 film)|Daisy Miller]]'', based on the [[Henry James]] novella. The film—a period piece set in Europe—proved to be a [[box office]] failure. Her next film, ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' (1975), a musical again directed by Bogdanovich, also flopped.

Shepherd returned with good reviews for her work in [[Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese's]] ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). According to Shepherd, Scorsese had requested a "Cybill Shepherd type" for the role. She portrayed an ethereal beauty with whom [[Robert De Niro]]'s character, Travis Bickle, becomes enthralled.

After a series of less successful roles, including ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1979 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', the remake of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|1938 film of the same name]], she moved back to her home town of Memphis to work in regional theatre.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bykowsky, Stuart|date=January 9, 1985|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wQpZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ulkDAAAAIBAJ&dq=cybill%20shepherd%201982&pg=6962%2C1909727|title=Cybill Shepherd: 'There is a freakdom to beauty'|work= [[Evening Independent]]|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> Returning to New York in 1982, she took to the stage alongside [[James MacArthur]] in a theatre tour of ''Lunch Hour'' by [[Jean Kerr]].<ref>{{cite web|date=August 4, 1982|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NBpJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KwYNAAAAIBAJ&dq=james%20macarthur%20cybill%20shepherd&pg=1112%2C382002|title=MacArthur & Shepherd star in ''Lunch Hour''|work= [[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

===Return to Hollywood===
Back from Memphis, Shepherd won the role of Colleen Champion in the night-time drama, ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'' (1983), opposite [[Sam Elliott]]. Although critically acclaimed, the series lasted only one season.
A year later Shepherd was cast as Maddie Hayes in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' (1985–1989), which became the role that defined her career. The producers knew that her role depended on having chemistry with her co-star, and she was involved in the selection of [[Bruce Willis]]. A lighthearted combination of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[comedy]], the series won Shepherd two [[Golden Globe]] awards.<ref name="Cybill Shepherd - Awards">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001732/awards|title=Cybill Shepherd - Awards|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref>

She starred in ''[[Chances Are (film)|Chances Are]]'' (1989) with [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Ryan O'Neal]], receiving excellent reviews. She then reprised her role as Jacy in ''[[Texasville]]'' (1990), the sequel to ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971), as the original cast (including director Peter Bogdanovich) reunited 20 years after filming the original. She also appeared in Woody Allen's ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'' (1990), and Eugene Levy's ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' (1992), as well as several television films.
In 1997 she won her third Golden Globe award<ref name="Cybill Shepherd - Awards"/> for CBS' ''[[Cybill]]'' (1995–1998), a television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]], in which the title character, Cybill Sheridan, an actress struggling with hammy parts in [[B movies]] and bad [[Soap opera|soaps]], was loosely modeled on herself (including portrayals of her two ex-husbands).

[[File:Cybill Shepherd.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Shepherd at 42nd [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival|KVIFF]], April 2007]]
In 2000 Shepherd's bestselling autobiography was published, titled ''[[Cybill Disobedience]]: How I Survived Beauty Pageants, Elvis, Sex, Bruce Willis, Lies, Marriage, Motherhood, Hollywood, and the Irrepressible Urge to Say What I Think'', written in collaboration with Aimee Lee Ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/05/14/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html|title=Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction|accessdate=April 5, 2011 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> That same year, Shepherd hosted a short-lived syndicated talk show version of the book ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'', but left the show in early 2001 and was replaced by [[Cristina Ferrare]], [[Bo Griffin]], [[Samantha Phillips]], [[Drew Pinsky]], and [[Rondell Sheridan]]. In 2003 she guest-starred on ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' as Cate Hennessy's (portrayed by [[Katey Sagal]]) sister. She has played [[Martha Stewart]] in two television films: ''[[Martha, Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart]]'' (2003) and ''[[Martha: Behind Bars]]'' (2005).

* She did not like working with [[Charles Grodin]] on ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]'' (1972), and that it took her several years to like him enough to have a one-night stand with him.
* [[Robert De Niro]] asked her out during the filming of ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). She turned him down, and he did not speak to her, except in character, for the rest of the filming. She later said that she regretted turning him down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watch.accesshollywood.com/video/cybill-shepherd-on-past-loves-almost-loves:-elvis-presley-robert-deniro-more/1560922953001# |title=Cybill Shepherd On Past Loves & Almost-Loves: Elvis Presley, Robert DeNiro & More |publisher=Watch.accesshollywood.com|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>
