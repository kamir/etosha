==Early life==
Blake was born '''Michael James Gubitosi'''<ref>{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Blake  |title=Tales of a Rascal: What I Did for Love |page=169 |year=2011 |publisher=Black Rainbow Productions |isbn=978-0-61-559194-0}}</ref>  in [[Nutley, New Jersey]]. His mother, Elizabeth Cafone (b. 1910), was married to Giacomo (James) Gubitosi (1906–1956).   In 1930, James worked as a die setter for a can manufacturer. Eventually, James and Elizabeth began a song-and-dance act.<ref name="Newton2008"/> In 1936, the three children began performing, billed as "The Three Little Hillbillies."<ref name="Newton2008"/> They moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1938, where their children began working as [[film|movie]] [[Extra (actor)|extra]]s.

Blake had an unhappy childhood and was allegedly abused by his alcoholic father. When he entered public school at age 10, he was bullied and had fights, which led to his expulsion. Blake states that he was physically and sexually abused by his parents while growing up and was frequently locked in a closet and forced to eat off the floor.<ref name="Newton2008"/> His father committed suicide in 1956.<ref name="Newton2008"/> At age 14, he ran away from home, leading to several more difficult years.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gary C. |last=King |title=Robert Blake and the Murder of Bonny Lee Bakley|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/bakley/15.html |page=15|publisher=Tru TV |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

==Child actor==
[[File:RobtBlake1944.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Robert Blake in 1944]]
Then known as '''Mickey Gubitosi''', Blake began his acting [[career]] as Toto in the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] movie ''[[Bridal Suite]]'' (1939) starring [[Annabella (actress)|Annabella]] and [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]].

Gubitosi then began appearing in MGM's ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short subjects]] (a.k.a. ''The Little Rascals'') under his real name, replacing [[Eugene Gordon Lee|Eugene "Porky" Lee]]. He appeared in 40 of the shorts between 1939 and 1944, eventually becoming the series' final lead character. James and Giovanna Gubitosi also made appearances in the series as extras. In ''Our Gang'', Gubitosi's character, Mickey, was often called upon to cry, for which he was criticized for being unconvincing. He was also criticized for being obnoxious and whiny.<ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |author2=Richard W. Bann  |title=The Little Rascals: The Life & Times of Our Gang |origyear=1977 |edition=Rev. ed. |year=1992 |publisher=Crown Publishing/Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-517-58325-9}}</ref> In 1942, he acquired the [[stage name]] Bobby Blake and his character in the series was renamed "Mickey Blake." In 1944, MGM discontinued ''Our Gang'', releasing the final short in the series ''[[Dancing Romeo]]''. In 1995, Blake was honored by the [[Young Artist Award|Young Artist Foundation]] with its [[Young Artist Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award|Former Child Star "Lifetime Achievement" Award]] for his role in ''Our Gang''.<ref name="Young Artist Awards 16">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms16.htm|title=16th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>

In 1942 Blake appeared as "Tooky" Stedman in ''[[Andy Hardy's Double Life]]''.

[[File:Robert Blake 1975.JPG|thumb|150px|Blake as Little Beaver]]
In [[1944 in film|1944]], Blake began playing a Native American boy, "Little Beaver," in the [[Red Ryder]] [[Western movie|Western]] series at the studios of Republic Pictures (now CBS Radford Studios), appearing in 23 of the movies until [[1947 in film|1947]]. He also had roles in one of [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s later films ''[[The Big Noise]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]), and the [[Warner Bros.]] movies ''[[Humoresque (film)|Humoresque]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]), playing [[John Garfield]]'s character as a child, and ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), playing the [[Mexico|Mexican]] boy who sells [[Humphrey Bogart]] a winning lottery ticket and gets a glass of water thrown in his face by Bogart in the process. In 1950, at age 17, Blake appeared as Mahmoud in ''[[The Black Rose]]'' and as Enrico, Naples Bus Boy (uncredited) in ''[[Black Hand (1950 film)|Black Hand]]''.

==Career as an adult==
In 1950, Blake joined the [[United States Army|Army]]. After returning to [[Southern California]], he entered [[Jeff Corey]]'s acting class and began working on improving his personal and professional lives. He eventually became a seasoned [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] actor, playing notable dramatic roles in movies and on [[television]]. In 1956, he was billed as Robert Blake for the first time.

In 1959, in what was considered a career blunder, he turned down the role of [[Little Joe (character)|Little Joe Cartwright]], a character ultimately portrayed by [[Michael Landon]], in [[NBC]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Bonanza]].'' Blake did appear that year as Tobe Hackett in the episode "Trade Me Deadly" of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] western series ''[[26 Men]],'' which dramatized true stories of the [[Arizona Rangers]]. Blake also appeared twice as "Alfredo" in the syndicated western ''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]'' and starred in "The White Hat" episode of ''[[Men of Annapolis]],'' another syndicated series. Blake appeared in three distinctive guest lead roles in the CBS series ''[[Have Gun Will Travel]]''. He also guest starred on [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s NBC western, ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', [[Nick Adams (actor)|Nick Adams]]'s ABC western, ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', the NBC western series, ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]'', and the ABC adventure series, ''[[Straightaway]]''.

Blake performed in numerous motion pictures as an adult, including the starring role in ''[[The Purple Gang]]'' ([[1960 in film|1960]]), a gangster movie, and featured roles in ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]'' in 1959 and, as one of four US soldiers participating in a gang rape in [[occupied Germany]], in ''[[Town Without Pity]]'' in 1961. He was also in ''[[Ensign Pulver]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]) and other films. In [[1967 in film|1967]], he experienced a career breakout playing real-life murderer [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]] in ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', for whom he bore a chilling physical resemblance.; [[Richard Brooks]]  was Oscar nominated for director, adapting [[Truman Capote]]'s non-fiction book for the film.
[[File:Robert Blake Baretta and Fred 1976.JPG|thumb|left|200px|As Baretta with Fred.]]
Blake played an Indian fugitive in ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), a TV movie adaptation of ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' (1981), and a motorcycle highway patrolman in iconoclastic ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]). He played a small-town stock car driver with ambitions to join the [[NASCAR]] circuit in ''[[Corky (film)|Corky]]'' which MGM produced in 1972. The film featured real NASCAR drivers, including [[Richard Petty]] and [[Cale Yarborough]].

Blake may be best known for his [[Emmy Award]]-winning role of Tony Baretta in the popular television series ''[[Baretta (television)|Baretta]]''<ref name="PM"/> (1975 to 1978), playing an undercover police detective who specialized in disguises. The show's trademarks included Baretta's pet [[cockatoo]] "Fred," his signature phrases&nbsp;— notably "That's the name of that tune" and "You can take that to the bank."

After ''Baretta'' ended, [[NBC]] offered to produce several pilot episodes of a proposed series called ''[[Joe Dancer]]'', in which Blake would play the eponymous role of a hard-boiled private detective. In addition to starring, Blake also was credited as the executive producer and creator. Four episodes aired to poor reviews in 1981 and 1983, and the series never ultimately sold.

He continued to act through the 1980s and 1990s, mostly in television, in such roles as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] in the miniseries ''[[Blood Feud (1983 film)|Blood Feud]]'' (1983) and as [[John List]] in the murder drama ''Judgment Day: The John List Story'' (1993), which earned him a third Emmy nomination. Blake starred in the 1985 television series ''[[Hell Town (TV series)|Hell Town]]'', playing a priest working in a tough neighborhood; and he also had character parts in the theatrical movies ''[[Money Train]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]) and as the chilling and sinister Mystery Man in [[David Lynch]]'s [[Lost Highway (film)|''Lost Highway'']] (1997).

==Marriages and children==
Blake and actress Sondra Kerr were married in 1961 and divorced in 1983. It was his first marriage, from which came two children: actor Noah Blake (born 1965) and Delinah Blake (born 1966).

In 1999, Blake met [[Bonnie Lee Bakley]], formerly of [[Wharton, New Jersey]], who reportedly had a history of exploiting older men—especially celebrities—for money.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/25/48hours/main516379.shtml |title = A Question Of Guilt: The Bakley Murder: Who Killed Bonny Lee Bakley? <!-- article is titled what it is, if there is a spelling error, it's CBS's fault --> |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=2002-08-05 |accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> She was dating [[Christian Brando]], son of [[Marlon Brando]], during her relationship with Blake. Bakley became pregnant and told both Brando and Blake that her baby was theirs. Initially, Bakley named the baby "Christian Shannon Brando" and stated that Brando was the father. <ref name="tru5">{{cite web |first=Gary C. |last=King |title=Robert Blake and the Murder of Bonny Lee Bakley |publisher=Tru TV |page=5 |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/bakley/5.html |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> Bakley wrote letters describing her dubious motives to Blake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/docs/letters.html?page=2 |title=Excerpts from letters written by victim found in defendant's home |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2003-03-06 |work=Court TV Online}}</ref> Blake insisted that she take a DNA test to prove the paternity.<ref name="tru5"/> Blake and Bakley married November 19, 2000 after [[DNA]] tests proved Blake to be the biological father of her child, renamed Rose. It was his second marriage and her tenth.

==Legal history==

===Arrest and trial for murder===
On May 4, 2001, Blake took Bakley for an Italian dinner at Vitello's Restaurant at 4349 Tujunga Avenue in Studio City. Afterward, Bakley was killed by a gunshot to the head while sitting in the car, which was parked on a side street around the corner from the restaurant. Blake claimed that he had returned to the restaurant to collect a gun which he had left there, and was not present when the shooting occurred. The gun that Blake claimed he had left in the restaurant was later determined not to have fired the shots that killed Bakley.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/bakley/1.html trutv.com]</ref>

On April 18, 2002, Blake was arrested and charged in connection with the murder of his wife. His longtime bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, was also arrested and charged with conspiracy in connection with murder. A key event that gave the LAPD the confidence to arrest Blake came when a retired stuntman, Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, agreed to testify against him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0425/blake_ap.html |title=Stuntmen key witnesses vs. Blake |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2002-04-25 |work=Court TV Online}}</ref> Hambleton alleged that Blake tried to hire him to kill Bonnie Lee Bakley. Another retired stuntman and an associate of Hambleton's, [[Gary McLarty]], came forward with a similar story.

According to author Miles Corwin, Hambleton agreed to testify against Blake only after being told he would be subject to a [[grand jury]] subpoena and a pending misdemeanor charge.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/011905_ctv.html |title=Author: Police suspected Robert Blake hours after wife was slain |accessdate=2007-04-02 |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |date=2005-01-20 |work = Court TV Online}}</ref> Hambleton's motives for testifying were called into question by Blake's defense team during the criminal trial.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/020105_ctv.html|title=Scene is set in Blake case; cue stuntmen  |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2005-02-01 |work=Court TV Online}}</ref>

On April 22, 2002, Blake was charged with one count of murder with special circumstances, an offense eligible for the death penalty. He was also charged with two counts of solicitation of murder and one count of murder conspiracy. Blake pleaded not guilty to all charges. Caldwell was charged with a single count of murder conspiracy and also pleaded not guilty. Three days later, the Los Angeles [[District attorney (county)|District Attorney]]'s office announced they would not seek the death penalty against Blake should he be convicted, but prosecutors would seek a sentence of life in prison without parole.

After Blake posted US$1 million bail, Caldwell was released, but a judge denied bail for Blake. On March 13, 2003, after almost a year in jail, Blake was granted bail, which was set at US$1.5 million, and he was allowed to go free to await trial. Blake was placed on house arrest during this time. On Oct. 31, in a major reversal for the prosecution, the judge dismissed the conspiracy charge against Blake and Caldwell during a pre-trial hearing.<ref name=part8/> The junior prosecutor who handled the case, Shellie Samuels, was interviewed by CBS reporter [[Peter Van Sant]] for the CBS program [[48 Hours Investigates]]. During the interview, broadcast in November 2003, she admitted the prosecutors had no forensic evidence implicating Blake, could not tie him to the murder weapon, had no witnesses and had virtually nothing in the way of hard evidence.<ref name=part8/>

====Murder trial and acquittal====

Blake's criminal trial for murder began on December 20, 2004, with opening statements by the prosecution and then the defense the following day.<ref name=part8>{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part8.html}}</ref> The prosecution contended that Blake intentionally murdered Bakley to free himself from a loveless marriage, while the defense challenged all of the evidence, claiming that Blake was an innocent victim of circumstantial and fabricated evidence.

Prosecution testimony began with various witnesses detailing the night of the murder and the murder weapon used. Bakley was shot twice while sitting in the passenger side of the parked car and the passenger window was rolled down, indicating she may have been familiar with her assailant. The murder weapon was revealed to be a semi-automatic Walther P-38 pistol, which was found in a dumpster a few yards away from the parked car where the shooting took place.

On February 7, 2005, Gary McLarty claimed that in March 2001, Blake attempted to contract him to murder his wife; McLarty allegedly declined. McLarty's testimony was subject to an intense cross-examination, which examined his history of mental problems and his difficulty remembering key details of the alleged contract offer. On February 9, testimony came from Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, who also claimed that Blake tried to solicit him to murder his wife. His testimony was also called into question during cross-examination when his past criminal record of various petty crimes for drug and gun possession was exposed.

The prosecution rested its case on February 14. The defense began its case with a series of witnesses, including relatives of Gary McLarty, who contradicted various parts of the prosecution's case, . On February 19, testimony was heard about the effects of chronic drug use on the mind—specifically, the minds of the two key prosecution witnesses, Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton and Gary McLarty, who were  drug users during their stuntman careers. The lack of gunshot residue on Blake's hands was also a key part of the defense's case that Blake was not the shooter. Robert Blake chose not to testify. The defense rested its case on February 23, and after closing arguments were made on March 2–3, the jury retired to deliberate on March 4.<ref>{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part9.html}}</ref>

On March 16, 2005, Blake was found not guilty of the murder of Bonnie Lee Bakley and of one of the two counts of solicitation of murder. The other count, the solicitation of Gary McLarty, was dropped after it was revealed that the jury was deadlocked 11–1 in favor of an acquittal. Los Angeles District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]], commenting on this ruling, called Blake a "miserable human being" and the jurors "incredibly stupid to fall for the defenses claims."<ref>{{cite web |title=Blake jurors want apology from D.A. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7284990 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2005-03-25 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Blake's defense team, led by attorney [[M.

===Civil case===
Bakley's three children filed a [[Lawsuit|civil suit]] against Blake, asserting that he was responsible for their mother's death. On November 18, 2005, the jury found Blake liable for the [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of his wife and ordered him to pay US$30 million. On February 3, 2006, Blake filed for [[bankruptcy]]. Expressing disbelief that Blake was found liable by the jury in the civil trial, Schwartzbach (Blake's attorney in the criminal trial) vowed to appeal the jury verdict.<ref>{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Deutsch |title=Blake to Appeal Wrongful-Death Verdict |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050801098.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2006-05-08 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

====Civil trial verdict appeal====
According to the Associated Press, Schwartzbach filed the appeal brief on February 28, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Deutsch |title=Robert Blake appeals $30M civil verdict |url=http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/entertainment/16805298.htm |work=[[Monterey County Herald]] |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Blake appeal brief |url=http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/_documents/blake_appeal.pdf |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2007-02-28 |format=pdf |work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The AP also reported that an LAPD Internal Affairs investigation has been opened regarding the lead detective in the murder case, Detective Ron Ito.

====Verdict upheld====
On April 26, 2008, an appeals court upheld the civil case verdict, but cut Blake's penalty assessment in half to US$15 million.  Blake's attorneys had protested that jurors improperly discussed the [[Michael Jackson]] and [[O.J. Simpson]] verdicts during deliberations of his case, but the appeals judge ruled that such discussions were not improper.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-04-27 |title=Actor Blake loses US court appeal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7369978.stm}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33530773/Appeal-From-Robert-Blake-Worngful-Death-Verdict-Opinion Court of Appeals Opinion]</ref>

===Retirement and 2010 tax lien===
Blake has maintained a low profile since his acquittal and his filing for bankruptcy with debts of US$3,000,000 for unpaid legal fees and state and federal taxes after the criminal and civil trials.<ref>[http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/taxingdetroitblog/index.php?blogid=295 DETNEWS | Weblogs | Tax Watchdog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Having retired from acting years before the murder of Bonnie Lee Bakley, and due to his legal issues, Blake has said that he might return to acting someday to help himself financially.<ref name=welkos>{{cite web|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|title=An Act 2 for Robert Blake?| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/25/entertainment/et-blake25| work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> On 9 April 2010, the state of [[California]] filed a tax lien against Blake for US$1,110,878 with the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] Recorder of Deeds for unpaid back taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webcpa.com/news/Robert-Blake-Tax-Lien-54728-1.html |title=Actor Robert Blake Hit with $1.1 Million Tax Lien |publisher=Webcpa.com |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>

In December 2011, Blake appeared on ''[[Tavis Smiley (TV series)|Tavis Smiley]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/actor-robert-blake-part-1/|title=The Tavis Smiley Show|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2012-01-18}}</ref> On 16 July 2012, Blake was interviewed on ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]''. During the interview, Blake was asked by Morgan about the night of the murder of Blake's wife, Bonnie. The line of questioning quickly led to Blake becoming defensive and angry. Blake said he resented Morgan's questioning and felt he was being interrogated. Morgan disagreed with Blake's assessment of the questioning saying he was only asking questions he felt people were eager to have answered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/11/robert-blake-on-his-murdered-wife-bonnie-lee-bakley-i-think-she-was-a-con-artist/?hpt=pm_mid|title=Robert Blake on his murdered wife Bonnie Lee Bakley|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> Blake told interviewers and wrote in his autobiography that he hoped he would be offered one more great acting role before he died.
