'''''Death to Smoochy''''' is a 2002 American [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Danny DeVito]], and starring [[Robin Williams]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Catherine Keener]], [[Jon Stewart]] and DeVito. The film received mixed reviews from critics and failed at the box office during its release, but in recent years it has developed a sizable [[Cult film|cult]] following{{fact|date=March 2015}}.

==Plot==
"Rainbow Randolph" Smiley ([[Robin Williams]]), a happily corrupt [[Children's television series|children's television]] host, is disgraced by an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sting for making deals with parents who want their kids on the show. He is replaced by the "squeaky clean" Sheldon Mopes ([[Edward Norton]]) and his character, Smoochy the [[Rhinoceros|Rhino]]. Mopes is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality child [[edutainment]], and his show quickly becomes tremendously popular. Randolph finds himself unemployed, homeless, and outcast from the television business by his two-faced associate Marion Stokes ([[Jon Stewart]]). In an effort to return to the spotlight, Randolph hatches several schemes to bring down Mopes in hopes of reclaiming his timeslot, including planting a phallic-shaped cookie into a live taping of the replacement show, ''Smoochy's Magic Jungle''.

Mopes quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to his hardened producer Nora Wells ([[Catherine Keener]]). With the help of his new agent Burke Bennett ([[Danny DeVito]]), Mopes renegotiates his contract and is named [[executive producer]]. [[Irish mob]] boss Tommy Cotter ([[Pam Ferris]]) approaches Mopes, asking him to create a spot on his show for her cousin Spinner ([[Michael Rispoli]]), a former [[Boxing|boxer]] whose numerous head injuries have left him with severe [[brain damage]], who just so happens to be a really big fan of ''Smoochy's Magic Jungle''. Reluctantly, Sheldon adds Spinner to the show, first as a cowbell-wielding game warden, and later on as Smoochy's cousin Moochy.
  
Mopes is horrified to learn that Burke signed him up to star in a Smoochy [[ice show]]; he fears that the event will exploit children. Burke and Merv Green ([[Harvey Fierstein]]), the heads of the corrupt charity running the ice show, warn Mopes not to back out of the event, but he does anyway. Soon afterward, a disguised Randolph tricks Mopes into performing a Smoochy act at a [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] rally that is raided by the police. Smoochy is branded a [[racism|racist]] and fired. However, when Randolph accidentally lets it slip to Nora that he set Sheldon up, he is arrested. Smoochy's reputation and show are restored. Nora and Mopes begin a relationship.

Mopes decides that half the proceeds of the ice show should go to the [[drug rehabilitation]] clinic where he used to work, which was closed due to lack of funding, and the other half to child literacy enhancement programs; the children who attend the show itself will be given free souvenirs and healthy snacks. Burke and Green retaliate by plotting to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming. However, Green and his men accidentally kill Spinner in his Moochy costume; Cotter and her men retaliate by killing them. Meanwhile, Randolph corners Mopes and Nora in their [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] and threatens to kill them. They talk him down and discover that he is [[depression (mood)|depressed]] and genuinely misses entertaining children. An empathetic Mopes offers to let Randolph stay in the penthouse until he recovers.

Burke and Stokes hire [[heroin]] addict Buggy Ding Dong ([[Vincent Schiavelli]]), another former host, to assassinate Mopes during his ice show. Buggy steals a [[backstage pass]] to get inside. However, Randolph, who has been summoned to the ice show, tackles Buggy just as he tries to shoot Mopes from the rafters. Randolph and Buggy struggle for the [[sniper rifle]], until Buggy falls to his death. After Mopes realizes that Bennett and Stokes set him up, he chases after Burke into an alley. He pulls a gun and threatens to kill Burke, but Cotter and her men arrive and persuade him not to forfeit his high ideals. Mopes and Nora move on, and Cotter decides to take care of Burke and Stokes in her own way. The movie ends with Smoochy and Rainbow Randolph launching a new show together.

==Reception==
The film currently holds a rating of 42% ("rotten") on review aggregator ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' based on 119 critics who contributed reviews thereto as well as a 66% audience rating; as the site's critical consensus has it, "The talent involved can't save a script that has nowhere to go with its promising premise."<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_to_smoochy/ Death to Smoochy—Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> On ''[[Metacritic]]'', its weighted average score is 38 from 30 critics, which the site considers "generally unfavorable".<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/death-to-smoochy Death to Smoochy Reviews—Metacritic]</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] wrote an extremely negative review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (giving it one-half of a star out of four), saying "Only enormously talented people could have made ''Death to Smoochy''. Those with lesser gifts would have lacked the nerve to make a film so bad, so miscalculated, so lacking any connection with any possible audience. To make a film this awful, you have to have enormous ambition and confidence, and dream big dreams."<ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] (2002-03-29).

[[J. Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'', however, praised the film: "''Death to Smoochy'' is often very funny, but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of DeVito's misanthropic vision."<ref>{{cite web |last= Hoberman|first=Jim |authorlink = J.
