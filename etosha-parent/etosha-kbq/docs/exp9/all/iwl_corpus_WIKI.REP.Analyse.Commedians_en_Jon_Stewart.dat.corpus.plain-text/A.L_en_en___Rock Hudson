Hudson is generally known for his turns as a [[leading man]] in the 1950s and 1960s. He achieved stardom with dramatic roles in films such as ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'', and found continued success with a string of romantic comedies costarring [[Doris Day]] (''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'', ''[[Lover Come Back (1961 film)|Lover Come Back]]'', ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]''). Hudson began a second career in television through the 1970s and 80s, starring in the popular [[mystery fiction|mystery]] series ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'' and the [[soap opera]] ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]''.

Hudson was voted Star of the Year, Favorite Leading Man, and similar titles by numerous film magazines. He completed nearly 70 films and starred in several television productions during a career that spanned over four decades. Hudson died in 1985, becoming the first major celebrity to die from an [[AIDS]]-related illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcmdb.com/participant.jsp?participantId=90260%7c133734&afiPersonalNameId=null |title=Overview for Rock Hudson |publisher=Tcmdb.com |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Hudson was born in [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], [[Illinois]], the only child of [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]] Katherine Wood (of [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent) and [[auto mechanic]] Roy Harold Scherer, Sr. (of [[Germans|German]] and [[Swiss]] descent), who abandoned the family during the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. His mother remarried and his stepfather, Wallace "Wally" Fitzgerald, adopted him and changed his surname to Fitzgerald. Hudson's years at [[New Trier High School]] were unremarkable, although he sang in the school's [[glee club]] and was remembered as a shy boy who delivered newspapers, ran errands, and worked as a [[golf caddy]].

After graduating from high school during [[World War II]] he trained at the [[Great Lakes Naval Training Station]], and with orders to report to Aviation Repair and Overhaul Unit 2 then located on [[Samar]], [[Philippines]], as an [[aircraft mechanic]] he departed San Francisco aboard the troop transport [[List of Liberty ships (Je–L)|''Lew Wallace'']].{{sfn|Wise|1997|p=178}}<ref name=autogenerated4>Berger, Joseph, [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/100385sci-aids.html "Rock Hudson, Screen Idol, Dies at 59"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 3, 1985. Retrieved February 12, 2011.</ref> In 1946, after returning to San Francisco aboard an aircraft carrier,{{sfn|Wise|1997|p=180}} Hudson moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue an acting career and applied to the [[University of Southern California]]'s dramatics program, but he was rejected due to poor grades. He worked as a truck driver for some time, longing to be an actor but with no success in breaking into the movies. After he sent talent scout [[Henry Willson]] a picture of himself in 1947, Willson took Hudson on as a client and changed his name to Rock Hudson, although Hudson later admitted he hated the name.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

==Career==
Hudson made his acting debut with a small part in the 1948 [[Warner Bros.]] film ''Fighter Squadron'', and took 38 takes to successfully deliver his only line in the film.<ref>''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson'' by Robert Hofler, Carroll & Graf, 2005, pp. 163–164 ISBN 0-7867-1607-X</ref> Hudson was further coached in [[acting]], [[singing]], [[dancing]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], and [[horseback riding]] at Universal International, and he began to be featured in film [[magazine]]s where he was promoted (possibly on the basis of his good looks).<ref name=autogenerated4 />

In 1953 he appeared in a [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]] commercial which showed him on the set of ''[[Seminole (film)|Seminole]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Rock Hudson (Actor)| year =1953 | title = Camel Cigarette Commercials, 16mm Transfers Reel # 8.

[[File:Taylor - Hudson - Giant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hudson, pictured with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), the film that led to his first [[Academy Award]] nomination]]

Director [[Douglas Sirk]] gave Hudson his first leading role, in the 1954 film ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'', co-starring Jane Wyman.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kashner|first1=Sam|last2=MacNair|first2=Jennifer|title=The bad & the beautiful : Hollywood in the fifties|date=2003|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32436-2|pages=144–154|edition=[1st Norton paperback].|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated4 />  The film received positive reviews, with ''Modern Screen Magazine'' citing Hudson as the most popular actor of the year.  His popularity soared with [[George Stevens]]' film ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956). Hudson and his co-star [[James Dean]] were both nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] category. In the 1950s, Hudson made nine films with acclaimed director and father-figure [[Douglas Sirk]], with Sirk's own favorite being ''[[The Tarnished Angels]]'' (1958).

Following [[Richard Brooks]]' acclaimed film ''Something of Value'' (1957) was a moving performance in [[Charles Vidor]]'s box office failure ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1957 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1957). In order to make ''A Farewell to Arms'', Hudson reportedly turned down [[Marlon Brando]]'s role in ''[[Sayonara]]'', [[William Holden]]'s role in ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', and [[Charlton Heston]]'s role in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001369/bio|title=Rock Hudson Biography|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> ''A Farewell to Arms'' received negative reviews, failed at the box office and became the last production by [[David O.

[[File:Rock Hudson - Julie Andrews.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Hudson and [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Darling Lili]]'', one of the many romantic comedies he filmed in the 1960s]]Hudson sailed through the 1960s on a wave of romantic comedies. He portrayed humorous characters in ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'', the first of three profitable co-starring performances with [[Doris Day]]. This was followed by ''[[Lover Come Back (1961 film)|Lover Come Back]]'', ''[[Come September]]'', ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'', ''[[Man's Favorite Sport?]]'', ''[[The Spiral Road]]'', and ''[[Strange Bedfellows (1965 film)|Strange Bedfellows]]''. Along with [[Cary Grant]], Hudson was regarded as one of the best-dressed male stars in Hollywood, and received Top 10 Stars of the Year a record-setting eight times from 1957 to 1964. He worked outside his usual range on the science-fiction thriller ''[[Seconds (film)|Seconds]]'' (1966). The film flopped but it later gained cult status, and Hudson's performance is often regarded as one of his best.<ref>[http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3835 Apollo Movie Guide's Review of Seconds<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He also tried his hand in the action genre with ''[[Tobruk (1967 film)|Tobruk]]'' (1967) and spy thriller ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968), a role which he had actively sought and remained his personal favorite. He also dabbled in westerns with ''[[The Undefeated (1969 film)|The Undefeated]]'' (1969).

Hudson's popularity on the big screen diminished after the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in a number of TV movies and series. His most successful television series was ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'' opposite [[Susan Saint James]], which ran from 1971 to 1977. Hudson played [[police commissioner]] Stewart "Mac" McMillan, with Saint James as his wife Sally, and their on-screen chemistry helped make the show a hit. Hudson took a risk and surprised many by making a successful foray into live theater late in his career, the most acclaimed of his efforts being ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' in 1974.

[[File:Rock Hudson en 'Embryo'.png|thumb|right|250px|Hudson in the lead role of ''[[Embryo (1976 film)|Embryo]]'' (1976), a horror/sci-fi film]]In the early 1980s, following years of heavy drinking and smoking, Hudson began having health problems which resulted in a heart attack in November 1981. Emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery sidelined Hudson and his new TV show ''The Devlin Connection'' for a year, and the show was canceled in December 1982 soon after it had first aired. Hudson recovered from the heart surgery but continued to smoke. He nevertheless continued to work with appearances in several TV movies. He was in ill health while filming the action-drama film ''The Ambassador'' in Israel during the winter months of 1983 to 1984. He reportedly did not get along with his co-star [[Robert Mitchum]], who had a serious drinking problem and often clashed off camera with Hudson and other cast and crew members.<ref>Server, Lee ''Baby, I Don't Care'' (2001)</ref> During 1984, while filming the TV drama ''The Vegas Strip Wars'', Hudson's health grew worse and prompted rumors that he was suffering from liver cancer (among other ailments) because of his increasingly gaunt face and build.

From December 1984 to April 1985, Hudson appeared in a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] prime time [[soap opera]] ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'' as Daniel Reece, the love interest for Krystle Carrington (played by [[Linda Evans]]) and biological father of the character Sammy Jo Carrington ([[Heather Locklear]]). While he had long been known to have difficulty memorizing lines, which resulted in his use of [[cue cards]], it was Hudson's speech itself that began to visibly deteriorate on ''Dynasty.'' He was originally slated to appear for the duration of the show's fifth season; however, because of his progressing ill health, his character was abruptly written out of the show and died off screen.

==Personal life==
While his career developed, Hudson and his agent [[Henry Willson]] kept the actor's personal life out of the headlines. In 1955, ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine threatened to publish an exposé about Hudson's secret [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] life. Willson stalled this by disclosing information about two of his other clients.<ref>Willson provided information about [[Rory Calhoun]]'s years in prison and the arrest of [[Tab Hunter]] at a party in 1950. See: Hofler, Robert. ''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson.'' New York: Carroll & Graf, 2005, pp. 248–250; Oppenheimer, Jerry and Vitek, Jack. ''Idol Rock Hudson: The True Story of an American Film Hero.'' New York: Villard Books, 1986, p. 55.</ref> According to some colleagues, Hudson's homosexuality was well known in Hollywood throughout his career,<ref name=autogenerated3>Yarbrough, Jeff.

Retrieved February 12, 2011.</ref> and former co-stars [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Susan Saint James]] claimed that they knew of his homosexual activity, as did [[Carol Burnett]]. Soon after the ''Confidential'' incident, Hudson married Willson's secretary [[Phyllis Gates]]. Gates later wrote that she dated Hudson for several months, lived with him for two months before his surprise marriage proposal, and married Hudson out of love and not (as it was later reported) to prevent an exposé of Hudson's sexual past.<ref>Phyllis Gates, ''My Husband, Rock Hudson'' (1987), written with [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]]</ref> Press coverage of the wedding quoted Hudson as saying: "When I count my blessings, my marriage tops the list." Gates filed for divorce after three years in April 1958, citing mental cruelty. Hudson did not contest the divorce and Gates received [[alimony]] of $250 a week for 10 years.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dennis Mclellan |title=Phyllis Gates: Her marriage to Hudson had fan magazines raving |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/obituaries/stories/011706dnmetgatesobit.ce8c30d.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref> After her death, the gay news magazine ''[[The Advocate]]'' published an article by Willson's biographer, which claimed that Gates was actually a [[lesbian]] who knew from the beginning of their relationship that Hudson was gay.<ref name=fa1>{{Cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2006_Feb_28/ai_n16107748 |title=Outing Mrs. Rock Hudson: the obits after Phyllis Gates died in January omitted some important facts: Those who knew her say she was a lesbian who tried to blackmail her movie star husband|accessdate=February 15, 2014  |publisher=The Advocate|date=Feb 28, 2006|author=Robert Hofler |url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Outing+Mrs.+Rock+Hudson%3A+the+obits+after+Phyllis+Gates+died+in...-a0143009615}}</ref> She never remarried.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/12/local/me-gates12/2|title=Phyllis Gates, 80; Former Talent Agency Secretary Was Briefly Married to Rock Hudson in '50s|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=January 12, 2006|publisher=latimes.com|page=2|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref>

According to the 1986 biography ''Rock Hudson: His Story'' by Hudson and [[Sara Davidson]], Hudson was good friends with American novelist [[Armistead Maupin]] and his lovers included Jack Coates (born 1944); Tom Clark (1933–1995), who also later published a memoir about Hudson, ''Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine''; and Marc Christian, who later won a suit against the Hudson estate. An [[urban legend]] states that Hudson married [[Jim Nabors]] in the early 1970s. Not only was same-sex marriage not recognized under the laws of any American state at the time, but, at least publicly, Hudson and Nabors were nothing more than friends. According to Hudson, the legend originated with a group of "middle-aged homosexuals who live in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]" who sent out joke invitations for their annual get-together. One year, the group invited its members to witness "the marriage of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors", at which Hudson would take the surname of Nabors' most famous character, [[Gomer Pyle]], becoming Rock Pyle. The "joke" was evidently already in the mainstream by the very early 1970s. In the October 1972 edition of ''[[MAD magazine]]'' (issue no. 154), an article entitled "When Watching Television, You Can be Sure of Seeing...", gossip columnist 'Rona Boring' states: "And there isn't a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! I repeat, they are not married! They are not even going steady!" Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor. As a result, Hudson and Nabors never spoke to each other again. Three years later, Nabors would begin a long-term (and, until 2013, secret) relationship with Stan Cadwallader, the man he would eventually marry once same-sex marriage was legalized.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barbara Mikkelson |title=Good Nabors Policy |url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/nabors.htm |publisher=Snopes |date=August 10, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref>

==Illness and death==
[[File:Reagans with Rock Hudson.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Hudson (left) with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at a White House state dinner, May 1984, less than three weeks before he was diagnosed with [[HIV]].]]

Unknown to the public, Hudson had been diagnosed with [[HIV]] on June 5, 1984. During most of 1984 and 1985, Hudson kept his illness a secret while continuing to work and at the same time travel to France and other countries seeking a cure, or at least treatment to slow the progress of the disease. On July 16, 1985, Hudson joined his old friend [[Doris Day]] for a press conference announcing the launch of her new TV cable show ''Doris Day's Best Friends'' in which Hudson was videotaped visiting Day's ranch in Carmel, California, a few days earlier. His gaunt appearance and almost incoherent speech pattern was so shocking that the reunion was broadcast repeatedly over national news shows that night and for days to come. Media outlets speculated on Hudson's health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20202713,00.html|title=Hudson's Day of Revelation|last=Martin|first=James A.|date=July 11, 1997|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> Two days later, Hudson traveled to Paris, France, for another round of treatment. After Hudson collapsed in his room at the Ritz Hotel in Paris on July 21, his publicist, Dale Olson, released a statement claiming that Hudson had inoperable [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]]. Olson denied reports that Hudson had [[AIDS]] and would say only that he was undergoing tests for "everything" at the [[American Hospital of Paris]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=negLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gVkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7186,1909318&dq=rock+hudson+liver+cancer&hl=en|title=Hospital: Hudson liver cancer report is false|last=Dunphy|first=Harry|date=July 24, 1985|work=The Evening Independent|page=3–A|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref>

He flew back to Los Angeles on July 30. Hudson was so weak that he was removed by stretcher from the Air France Boeing 747 he had chartered and upon which he and his medical attendants were the only passengers.<ref>Shilts, Randy.

In its August 15, 1985, issue, [[People (magazine)|''People'']] published a story that discussed his disease in the context of his sexuality. The largely sympathetic article featured comments from famous show business colleagues such as [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Robert Stack]], and [[Mamie Van Doren]], who claimed they knew about Hudson's homosexuality and expressed their support for him.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> At that time, ''People'' had a circulation of more than 2.8 million,<ref>Diamond, Edwin. ''Celebrating Celebrity: The New Gossips''. [[New York Magazine]], Vol. 18, No. 19. May 13, 1985.</ref> and, as a result of this and other stories, theories about Hudson's homosexuality became fully public.

Hudson's revelation had an immediate impact on the visibility of AIDS, and on the funding of medical research related to the disease. Among activists who were seeking to de-stigmatize AIDS and its victims, Hudson's revelation of his own infection with the disease was viewed as an event that could transform the public's perception of AIDS. Shortly after Hudson's press release disclosing his infection, [[William M. Hoffman]], the author of ''[[As Is (play)|As Is]]'', a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: "If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It's just a disease, not a moral affliction."<ref name=autogenerated3 /> At the same time, [[Joan Rivers]] was quoted as saying: "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS to the attention of the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage."<ref name=autogenerated3 /> [[Morgan Fairchild]] said that "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3281609.stm

I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth."<ref name=autogenerated4 />

Shortly after his death, ''People'' reported: "Since Hudson made his announcement, more than $1.8 million in private contributions (more than double the amount collected in 1984) has been raised to support AIDS research and to care for AIDS victims (5,523 reported in 1985 alone).

However, Hudson's revelation did not immediately dispel the stigma of AIDS.

Retrieved February 11, 2001.</ref> At the same time Reagan called Hudson privately in his Paris hospital room where he was being treated in July 1985.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

After Hudson revealed his diagnosis, a controversy arose concerning his participation in a scene in the television drama ''Dynasty'' in which he shared a long and repeated kiss with actress [[Linda Evans]] in one episode (aired in February 1985 for the first time). When filming the scene, Hudson was aware that he had AIDS, but did not inform her. Some felt that he should have disclosed his condition to her beforehand.<ref>Haller, Scot.

Asner said that he was aware of scripts being rewritten to eliminate kissing scenes.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean.

==Legacy==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hudson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 6116 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/rock-hudson/|title=Hollywood Star Walk: Rock Hudson|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> Following his death, [[Elizabeth Taylor]], his co-star in the film ''Giant'', purchased a bronze plaque for Hudson on the [[West Hollywood Memorial Walk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lisaburks.typepad.com/gravehunting/2009/06/rock-walk.html|title=http://lisaburks.typepad.com/gravehunting/2009/06/rock-walk.html|publisher=Lisaburks.typepad.com |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref> In 2002, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated |format=PDF |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Lawsuit==
Following Hudson's death, Marc Christian, Hudson's former lover, sued his estate on grounds of "intentional infliction of emotional distress".<ref>{{cite news |author=Willard Manus |title=The Cleaning Man Airs Rock Hudson's Dirty Laundry in L.A. |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/57447.html |work=Playbill |date=December 18, 2000 |accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref> Christian claimed that Hudson continued having sex with him until February 1985, more than eight months after Hudson knew that he had HIV. Although he repeatedly tested negative for HIV, Christian claimed that he suffered from "severe emotional distress" after learning from a newscast that Hudson had died of AIDS. Christian also sued Hudson's personal secretary, Mark Miller, for $10 million because Miller allegedly lied to him about Hudson's illness. In 1989, a jury awarded Christian $21.75 million in damages, later reduced to $5.5 million. Christian died of "pulmonary problems" caused by years of heavy smoking in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/05/local/la-me-marc-christian5-2009dec05|title=Marc Christian MacGinnis dies at 56; Rock Hudson's ex-lover|last=Woo|first=Elaine|date=December 5, 2009|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref>

In the book ''Rock Hudson, Friend of Mine'' by his live-in Hollywood publicist Tom Clark, Clark said he would go to his grave believing that Hudson acquired HIV from blood transfusions during his emergency quintuple bypass open-heart surgery in 1981. Clark's book characterized Christian as "a criminal, a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist and a squatter". Christian then sued Clark. Christian was living in the guest house after Clark, who had left in 1983, had returned to Hudson's home in 1985 to take care of him at assistant Mark Miller's request.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-05/local/me-1051_1_rock-hudson | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Carol | last=McGraw | title=Rock Hudson Ex-Lover Files Libel Suit | date=April 5, 1990}}</ref> In 2010, Robert Park Mills, the attorney who represented the Hudson estate against Christian in court, released a book entitled ''Between Rock and a Hard Place: In Defense of Rock Hudson''. In the book, Mills discusses details of the trial and also questions Christian's allegations against Hudson.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker Mills|first=Robert |title=Between Rock and a Hard Place: In Defense of Rock Hudson: From the Ashes of Trial to the Light of Truth|year=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=1-456-70039-1|pages=x–xi}}</ref> Ironically, Christian's partner of nine years Brent Beckwith also took legal action after not securing an expected share of Christian's estate. The case resulted in the creation of new tort: Interfering with an Expected Inheritance.<ref>Beckwith v.
