==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
Essman has been traveling and appearing at clubs throughout the country for more than two decades. Her first half-hour special appeared on Comedy Central in 1992; as much of her comedy draws from her [[ethnic]] background, she has been featured in such documentaries as, "Heroes of Jewish Comedy" and "A History of Jewish Comedy".

On October 15, 2004, she performed at the [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] of [[Donald Trump]], in which she [[Parody|lampooned]] the [[tycoon]] with lines like "Donald, did you enjoy your meal? I heard your hair ordered the salmon" and "I'm so not your type. I'm smart, my boobs are real, and I speak English."<ref>[http://www.susieessman.com/#trump Official Susie Essman website]</ref> Essman made her [[U.K.]] [[standup comedy]] debut at the [[Corn Exchange, Newbury|Corn Exchange]] at the [[Newbury Comedy Festival]] in July 2007. While in [[England]], she appeared on the British television show ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]''.

Essman is best known for her role as [[Curb Your Enthusiasm#Characters|Susie Greene]], the wife of [[Curb Your Enthusiasm#Characters|Jeff Greene]] (portrayed by [[Jeff Garlin]]), on the [[HBO]] comedy series ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. Essman told [[The New York Times]] that, by the show's third season, she could not "walk down the street anymore without people stopping her and begging her to say [her character's catchphrase] 'You fat fuck'".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 2007, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' named Essman's character one of the best on television, and a reason the publication looked forward to the return of the show.<ref>Slate, Lapidos, Juliet. November 23, 2003: [http://www.slate.com/id/2174389 "Oh, How We've Missed You! The Best Characters on Television"]</ref>

She also provided the voice of Helen Higgins on the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Crank Yankers]]''; she was an occasional correspondent on the first season of the network's ''[[The Daily Show]]''. She made memorable comic cameos in three 1988 films – ''[["Crocodile" Dundee II]]'', ''[[Baby Boom (film)|Baby Boom]]'' and ''[[Punchline (film)|Punchline]]''. She appeared on Comedy Central's Roast of [[Bob Saget]] on August 17, 2008 and provided the voice of "Mittens" (the cat) in the [[Disney]] animated film, ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', and reprised the role in the 2009 short ''[[Super Rhino]]''. She also made an appearance on the [[Regis Philbin]] version of ''[[Million Dollar Password]]''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In October 2013, she had a sell out run at London's Soho Theatre. She also appeared as the sole guest on [[Gilbert Gottfried]]'s first podcast recorded before a live audience at the Fontana bar in Manhattan's Chinatown in January 2015.

Essman's book, ''What Would Susie Say: Bullshit Wisdom About Love, Life and Comedy'', was published in October 2009 by [[Simon and Schuster]].<ref>
