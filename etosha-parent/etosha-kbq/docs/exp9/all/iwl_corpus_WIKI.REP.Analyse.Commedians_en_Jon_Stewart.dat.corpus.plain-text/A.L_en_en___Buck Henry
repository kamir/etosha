==Early life==
Henry was born in New York City, the son of silent film actress [[Ruth Taylor (actress)|Ruth Taylor]] and Paul Steinberg Zuckerman (April 15, 1899 – 1965), a retired Air Force brigadier general and [[stockbroker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Buck-Henry.html|title=Buck Henry Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,219497,00.html|title=That Old Feeling: Sweet Smells|publisher=TIME|date=March 21, 2002|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=[Displaying Abstract]|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B1FF93C54167A93C6A91789D95F418685F9|title=PAUL S.

Buck Henry attended [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) and [[Dartmouth College]], where he met [[Bob Rafelson]], and also worked on the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' humor magazine. From 1959 to 1962, as part of an elaborate hoax by comedian [[Alan Abel]], he pretended to be G. Clifford Prout, the quietly outraged president of the [[Society for Indecency to Naked Animals]], who presented his point of view on talk shows. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Television career==
Henry's dry humor attracted attention in the entertainment community. He became a cast member on [[television|TV]] programs such as ''[[Steve Allen|The New Steve Allen Show]]'' (1961) and  ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' (1964–65). He was a co-creator and writer for ''[[Get Smart]]'' (1965–70), with [[Mel Brooks]]. Two of his TV projects had short runs but are fondly remembered by fans: ''[[Captain Nice]]'' (1967) with [[William Daniels]] as a reluctant superhero, and ''[[Quark (TV series)|Quark]]'' (1978), with [[Richard Benjamin]] in command of a garbage scow in outer space.  He also played Dr. Victor Rudman, a fractile scientist who dated Murphy, on the "My Dinner With Einstein" episode (1989) of ''[[Murphy Brown]]''.

He appeared on the television show ''[[Will and Grace]]'' in 2005. In 2007, he made two guest appearances on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as a contributor, billed as the show's "Senior Senior Correspondent". He has also appeared as Liz Lemon's father, Dick Lemon, in the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episodes "[[Ludachristmas]]" (December 13, 2007) and "[[Gentleman's Intermission]]" (November 4, 2010). In 2011, he appeared in a multi-episode arc of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' as Elka's groom.

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Henry hosted NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ten times, appearing first in 1976, and for the last time in 1980.  It became a tradition in those four years that he hosted the last show of each season. Henry also hosted the only live remote attempted by ''SNL'', broadcast live from [[Mardi Gras]] in [[New Orleans]]. Henry's frequent host record would be broken when [[Steve Martin]] hosted the 14th season finale in 1989.<ref>As of 2011, Alec Baldwin is now the most frequent male host in ''SNL'' history with 16 episodes.</ref> During the October 30, 1976 episode, Buck Henry was injured in the forehead by [[John Belushi]]'s [[katana]] in the [[Saturday Night Live Samurai|samurai]] sketch. Henry's head began to bleed and he was forced to wear a large bandage on his forehead for the rest of the show. As a gag, the members of the ''SNL'' cast each wore a bandage on their foreheads as well.
