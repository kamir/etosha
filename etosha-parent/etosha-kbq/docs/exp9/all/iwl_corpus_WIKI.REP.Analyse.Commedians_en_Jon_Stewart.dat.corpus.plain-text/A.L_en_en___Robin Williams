===College and Juilliard School===
After high school graduation, Williams enrolled at [[Claremont McKenna College|Claremont Men's College]] in [[Claremont, California]] to study [[political science]], then later dropped out to pursue acting.<ref name="Kornbluth" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Golum |first=Rob |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-11/actor-robin-williams-dead-in-apparent-suicide.html |title=Robin Williams, Oscar Winner, Dies After Hanging Himself |work=Bloomberg News |date=August 12, 2014|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20141011002226/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-11/actor-robin-williams-dead-in-apparent-suicide.html|archivedate = October 11, 2014|deadurl = no}}</ref> Williams then studied theatre for three years at the [[College of Marin]], a [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]] in [[Kentfield, California]]. According to Marin drama professor James Dunn, the depth of Williams's talent first became evident when he was cast in the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' as [[Fagin]]. Williams was known to improvise during his time in Marin's drama program, putting cast members in hysterics.<ref name="Hansen">{{cite news |last=Hansen |first=Megan |title='We knew him as a neighbor': Marin remembers Robin Williams |url=http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_26319466/we-knew-him-neighbor-marin-remembers-robin-williams |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |work=Marin Independent Journal |date=August 11, 2014|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140813072755/http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_26319466/we-knew-him-neighbor-marin-remembers-robin-williams|archivedate = August 13, 2014|deadurl = no}}</ref> Dunn called his wife after one late rehearsal to tell her that Williams "was going to be something special."<ref name="Hansen" />

In 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the [[Juilliard School]] in New York City. He was one of only 20 students accepted into the freshman class and one of only two students to be accepted by [[John Houseman]] into the Advanced Program at the school that year; the other was [[Christopher Reeve]]. [[William Hurt]] and [[Mandy Patinkin]] were also classmates.<ref name=Maslon>Maslon, Laurence, and Kantor, Michael.

{{quote|He wore tie-dyed shirts with track suit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was "on" would be a major understatement.<ref name="reeve"/>}}

Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who, Reeve said, was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers. Skinner had no idea what to make of Williams, adds Reeve, as he [Williams] could instantly perform in many dialects, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo," notes Reeve. Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn sometimes criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his convincing role of an old man in ''The Night of the Iguana,'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]. "He simply ''was'' the old man," observed Reeve. "I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together."<ref name="reeve"/>

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
[[File:Robin Williams in Camp Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Williams performing stand-up comedy at a [[United Service Organization|USO]] show on December 20, 2007]]
After his family moved to [[Marin County]], Williams began his career doing stand-up comedy shows in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the mid-1970s. His first performance took place at the [[Holy City Zoo]], a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from tending bar to getting on stage.<ref name=Zehme/> In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance," writes critic Gerald Nachman.<ref name=Nachman>Nachman, Gerald. ''Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s'', Pantheon, N.Y. (2003)</ref>{{rp|6}} Williams says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud,"<ref name=Maslon/> (a humorous mis-para-phrasing of the opening of [[Howl]] by [[Allen Ginsberg]]). 

He moved to Los Angeles and continued doing stand-up shows at various clubs, including the Comedy Club, in 1977, where TV producer [[George Schlatter]] saw him. Schlatter, realizing that Williams would become an important force in show business, asked him to appear on a revival of his [[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|''Laugh-In'']] show.  The show aired in late 1977 and became his debut TV appearance.<ref name=Maslon/> Williams also performed a show at the LA [[The Improv|Improv]] that same year for [[Home Box Office]].<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH7crqRvhhc&list=WL&index=2 "Young Robin Williams at the Los Angeles Improv, 1977]</ref> While the ''Laugh-In'' revival failed, it led Williams into a career in television, during which period he continued doing stand-up at comedy clubs, such as the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]], to help him keep his improvisational skills sharp.<ref name=Maslon/><ref>video: {{YouTube|id=LsIh5z7oYyY&t=2m25s|title=Robin Williams at the Roxy, 1978}}</ref>

====Early influences====
Williams has credited other comedians with having influenced and inspired him, including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Nichols and May]], and [[Lenny Bruce]].  He attributed their influence to their ability to attract a more intellectual audience by using a higher level of wit.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|43}} He also liked [[Jay Leno]] for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines, and [[Sid Caesar]], whose acts he felt were "precious."<ref name=Grobel>{{cite news | work = [[Playboy]] | date = January 1992 | first = Lawrence | last = Grobel | title = Playboy Interview:Robin Williams }}</ref> Jonathan Winters became his "idol" early in life; Williams first saw him on television at age 8 and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|259}}<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead_n_3070474.html|title = Jonathan Winters Dead: 'Mork and Mindy' Star Dies At Age 87|date = April 12, 2013|work = Huffington Post|accessdate = October 23, 2014|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6TXrQUU82|archivedate = October 23, 2014|deadurl = no}}</ref> Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, "that anything is possible, that anything is funny{{nowrap|. . .}} He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|260}}

During an interview in [[London]] in 2002, he told [[Sir Michael Parkinson]] that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'': "It doesn't get better than that." Williams owned a rare recording of Sellers's early radio [[Goon Show]]s. British comedy actors [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Cook]] were also among his influences, he told Parkinson.<ref>video: {{cite interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI |last=Williams |first=Robin |interviewer=[[Michael Parkinson]] |title=Robin Williams, Parkinson interview 2002 |accessdate=September 18, 2014}}</ref> Williams was also influenced by [[Richard Pryor]]'s fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was "cheaper than therapy" and gave him a way to release his pent up energy and emotions.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|121}}

====Televised live performances====
Williams won a [[Grammy Award]] for the recording of his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York, "Reality...What a Concept". Some of his later tours, after he became a TV and film star, include ''An Evening With Robin Williams'' (1982), ''Robin Williams: At The Met'' (1986) and ''Robin Williams Live on Broadway'' (2002). The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets were sold out within thirty minutes of going on sale.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Carter|title=Shazbot Robin Williams: Because we did, in fact, love him|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-reviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/|website=commdiginews.com|accessdate=August 12, 2014|publisher = Communities Digital News|date = August 11, 2014|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140812224009/http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-reviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}</ref> In 1986, Williams released ''[[A Night at the Met]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benedictus|first1=Leo|title=Comedy gold: Robin Williams's A Night at the Met|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold|accessdate=December 3, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>

After a six-year break, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour titled "Weapons of Self-Destruction". He said that this was his last chance to make jokes at the expense of the Bush administration, but by the time the show was staged, only a few minutes covered that subject. The tour started at the end of September 2009 and concluded in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO special on December 8, 2009.<ref>[http://beforeitsnews.com/eu/2014/08/robin-williams-jokes-at-the-expense-of-the-bush-administration-weapons-of-self-destruction-2566732.html "Robin Williams' jokes at the expense of the Bush administration – Weapons of Self Destruction."] ''Before It's News'', August 12, 2014</ref>

====Hardships in performing stand-up====
Williams said that partly due to the stress of doing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career.  He further said that he never drank or took drugs while on stage but occasionally performed when ill with a hangover from the previous day. During the period he was using [[cocaine]], he said that it made him paranoid when performing on stage.<ref name=Grobel/>

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:
{{blockquote|It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle—partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|34–35}}}}

Some, such as the critic [[Vincent Canby]], were concerned that Williams' monologues were so intense that it seemed as though at any minute his "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Williams felt secure he could not run out of ideas as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.<ref name=Grobel/> He also explained that he often used [[Free association (psychology)#Characteristics|free association]] of ideas while improvising in order to keep audience interest.<ref>video: {{YouTube|id=4LaJDOD5cJI&t=14m20s|title=Robin Williams interview with Sir Michael Parkinson, 2002}}</ref> Williams noted that the competitive comedy club atmosphere could cause problems. For example, some comedians accused him of intentionally copying their jokes, although Williams strongly denied ever doing so.<ref name=Grobel/> [[Whoopi Goldberg]] explained that it is difficult for comedians to not pick up and reuse another comedian's material, and that it is done "all the time."<ref name="rs comedy">{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-fears-of-a-clown-20140811 | title = Robin Williams: Fears of a Clown | first = Jeff | last = Giles | date = February 21, 1991 | accessdate = August 17, 2014 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> He later avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.<ref name="rs comedy"/>

During a ''Playboy'' interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing the ability to speak openly about those kinds of events and subjects, and admitted that he would, "if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't spark, still fire off or talk about things." While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist [[Jerzy Kosiński]] to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father, who he said gave him self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.<ref name=Grobel/>

After the ''[[Laugh-In]]'' revival and appearing in the cast of ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'' on [[NBC]], Williams was cast by [[Garry Marshall]] as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the hit TV series ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name=Maslon/><ref name="actors">{{cite episode | title = Robin Williams | series = Inside the Actors Studio | season = 7 | number = 710 | airdate = June 10, 2001 | network = Bravo | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | credits = James Lipton (host)}}</ref> Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html|publisher=Biography Channel|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}</ref> As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice. Mork's appearance was so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off hit television sitcom ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'', which ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate Williams's improvisations. Although he portrayed the same character as in ''Happy Days'', the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado instead of the late 1950s in [[Milwaukee]]. ''Mork & Mindy'' at its peak had a weekly audience of 60 million and was credited with turning Williams into a "superstar."<ref name=Maslon/> According to critic [[James Poniewozik]], the series was especially popular among young people as Williams became a "man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of invention."<ref name=Corliss>{{cite journal |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://time.com/3110842/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy/ |title=Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy |magazine=Time |date=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three [[HBO]] comedy specials, ''Off The Wall'' (1978), ''An Evening with Robin Williams'' (1982) and ''Robin Williams: Live at the Met'' (1986). Also in 1986, Williams co-hosted the [[58th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=John J |title=The Academy Awards Ceremony |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/movies/the-academy-awards-ceremony.html |accessdate=August 12, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times|date = March 26, 1986|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140812213954/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/movies/the-academy-awards-ceremony.html|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}</ref>

Williams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''<ref>video clip; {{YouTube|iqdSagycCWc|"Robin Williams on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show – 1991"}}</ref> and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', on which he appeared 50 times. Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at the Comedy Store in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. "He came in like a hurricane," said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html|title = Letterman Remembers the First Time He Met Robin Williams|date = August 19, 2014|accessdate = 2014-10-23|website = Slate|last = Lockett|first = Dee}}</ref>

Williams's stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002).

Williams' first film was the 1977 low-budget comedy ''Can I Do It 'Till I Need Glasses?''.

Among the actors who helped him during his acting career, he credited [[Robert De Niro]], from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialog when acting, to portray the deep-driven man. From [[Dustin Hoffman]], with whom he co-starred in ''Hook'', he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation.

[[Terry Gilliam]], who co-founded ''[[Monty Python]]'' and directed Williams in two of his films, ''The Fisher King'' and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), noted in 1992 that Williams had the ability to "go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable," adding that to him Williams was "the most unique mind on the planet.

During his career, he starred as a voice actor in several animated films. His voice role as the [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#The Genie|Genie]] in the animated, musical fantasy film, ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) was written specifically for Williams. The film's directors stated that they took a risk by writing the role, and successfully convinced him to take it.<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOo9XqAyxE&t=2m24s "Turning Robin Williams into 'Aladdin's' Genie"], ''ABC News'', August 15, 2014</ref> Through approximately 30 hours of tape,<ref name="Kornbluth" /> Williams was able to improvise much of his dialogue and impersonated dozens of celebrity voices, including Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F.

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Robin Williams Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|Williams' star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.<ref name=Grobel/><ref>[http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure "Glenn Close on Friend and Colleague: 'Robin Williams Was a World Treasure'"], ''Showbiz411'', August 13, 2014</ref>

His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression.<ref name=CSM>[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video "Robin Williams: His unscripted riffs were not merely funny, but observant"],(+video), ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 12, 2014</ref> According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, "probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person."<ref name=CSM/>

Williams' unusual free-form style of comedy became so identified with him that new comedians imitated him. [[Jim Carrey]] impersonated his Mork character early in his own career.<ref>{{YouTube|9zorOqE0j1c|"Jim Carrey Impersonates Robin Williams"}}</ref> Williams's high-spirited style has been credited with paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing Williams's spontaneous style: "one moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space."<ref>Rappoport, Leon. ''Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor'', Greenwood Publishing (2005)  p. 136</ref> According to [[Judd Apatow]], Williams's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, however, his talent was unique enough that no one else tried to copy it.<ref name="Browne">Browne, David. "Robin Williams, 1951-2014", ''Rolling Stone'', Sept. 11, 2014 pp. 38-47</ref>

As a film actor, Williams' roles often influenced others, both in and out of the film industry. Director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who directed Williams in ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', says that watching him work "was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/13/chris-columbus-speaks-about-life-with-ro/?print|title = Valley native Chris Columbus speaks about life with Robin Williams|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = October 24, 2014|website = vindy.com}}</ref>

Looking over most of Williams' films, Alyssa Rosenberg at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was "struck by the breadth of Williams' roles", and how radically different most were, writing that "Williams helped us grow up."<ref name="WP"/>
