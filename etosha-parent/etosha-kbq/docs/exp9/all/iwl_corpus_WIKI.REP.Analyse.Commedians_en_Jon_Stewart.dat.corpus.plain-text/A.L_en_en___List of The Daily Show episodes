''[[The Daily Show]]'' is an American [[Late night television|late-night]] [[news satire|satirical]] [[television program]] airing each Monday through Thursday on [[Comedy Central]] and, in Canada, [[The Comedy Network]]. The half-hour-long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was [[anchorman|hosted]] by [[Craig Kilborn]] until December 1998. [[Jon Stewart]] took over as host in January 1999, making the show more strongly focused on politics and the national media, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. It is currently the second longest-running program on Comedy Central, and has won 18 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. A total of <!--Episode count can be edited in the info box of the main page.

Describing itself as a [[News satire|fake news]] program, ''The Daily Show'' draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often, aspects of the [[self-referential humor|show itself]]. The show typically opens with a long [[monologue]] from Jon Stewart relating to recent headlines and frequently features exchanges with one or more of several [[List of The Daily Show correspondents|correspondents]], who adopt [[reductio ad absurdum|absurd or humorously exaggerated takes]] on current events against Stewart's [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]] persona. The final segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to nonfiction authors and political figures.<ref name=imdb>{{cite web|title=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (TV Series 1996- ) - Episodes - IMDB|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115147/episodes|work=imdb}}</ref><ref name=interbridge>{{cite web|title=The Late Night TV Page - Talk Show Guest Listings|url=http://www.interbridge.com/lineups.html#DS|work=interbridge}}</ref><ref name=archive>{{cite web|title=Snapshot of guests from 1996 to 2005|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050206045333/http://www.shuntv.net/tdslist.html|work=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref name=tvdb>{{cite web|title=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart: Complete Episode List|url=http://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&id=71256&lid=7|work=thetvdb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epguides.com/DailyShow/ |title=The Daily Show |publisher=''[[epguides]]'' |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref>
