'''Agnes Robertson Moorehead''' (December 6, 1900 – April 30, 1974) was an American actress whose career of more than three decades included work in radio, stage, film, and television.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', May 8, 1974, page 286.</ref> She is chiefly known for her role as Endora on the [[television series]] ''[[Bewitched]]''. She was also notable for her film roles in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', and ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''.

While rarely playing leads in films, Moorehead's skill at character development and range earned her one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and two [[Golden Globe]] awards in addition to four [[Academy Award]] and six Emmy Award nominations. Moorehead's transition to television won acclaim for drama and comedy. She could play many different types, but often portrayed haughty, arrogant characters.

==Early life==
Moorehead was born in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry, to a [[Presbyterian]] [[clergy]]man, John Henderson Moorehead, and his wife, the former Mildred McCauley, who had been a singer. Moorehead later shaved six years off her age by claiming to have been born in 1906. Moorehead recalled her first public performance was at the age of three, reciting "[[The Lord's Prayer]]" in her father's church. The family moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and Moorehead's ambition to become an actress grew "very strong". Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, "Who are you today, Agnes?", while Moorehead and her sister<ref>Kear, Lynn. ''Agnes Moorehead: a Bio-Bibliography''. (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1992). ISBN 0-313-28155-6. Page 2. Moorehead rarely spoke of her younger sister Margaret, who died when both were children, and was often thought of as an only child</ref> would often engage in mimicry, often coming to the dinner table and imitating parishioners. Moorehead noted and was encouraged by her father's amused reactions. She joined the chorus of the [[The Muny|St. Louis Municipal Opera Company]], known as "The Muny". In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in religion; in later years, actors such as [[Dick Sargent]] would recall Moorehead's arriving on the set with "the [[Bible]] in one hand and the script in the other".<ref name="kear"/>

Moorehead graduated from Central High School in St. Louis, in 1918. Although her father did not discourage Moorehead's acting ambitions, he insisted that she obtain a formal education. In 1923, Moorehead earned a [[bachelor's degree]], with a major in [[biology]], from [[Muskingum College]] (now Muskingum University) in [[New Concord, Ohio]]; while there, she also appeared in college stage plays. She later received an honorary [[doctorate]] in literature from Muskingum and served for a year on its board of trustees. When her family moved to [[Reedsburg, Wisconsin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reedsburgwi.gov/index.asp?SEC=F4929A3E-5508-478A-9599-29714D684216&Type=B_BASICl|title=Reedsburg's Notable Citizens
|publisher=  City of Reedsburg, Wisconsin|accessdate= May 23, 2014}}</ref> she taught public school for five years in [[Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin]], while she also earned a [[master's degree]] in English and public speaking at the University of Wisconsin (now [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]). She then pursued postgraduate studies at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Bradley University]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].

==Career==
Moorehead's early career was unsteady, and, although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed and forced to go hungry. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her "the value of a dollar". She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met the actress [[Helen Hayes]], who encouraged her to try to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. Rejected as not being "the right type", Moorehead returned to radio.

===Mercury Theatre===
[[File:Citizen Kane-Agnes Moorehead2.JPG|left|thumb|210px|Agnes Moorehead in the trailer for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)]] 
Moorehead met [[Orson Welles]], and by 1937 was one of his principal [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]], along with [[Joseph Cotten]]. She performed in his ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial ''[[The Shadow]]'' as Margo. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for [[RKO Pictures]]. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as his mother in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), considered one of the best films ever made. She also appeared in his films ''[[Journey into Fear (film)|Journey Into Fear]]'' (1943), based on a novel by [[Eric Ambler]], and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), based on a novel by [[Booth Tarkington]]. She received a [[New York Film Critics Award]] and an Academy Award nomination for her performance in the latter film. Moorehead received positive reviews for her performance in ''[[Mrs. Parkington]]'', as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination.

Moorehead played another strong role in ''[[The Big Street]]'' (1942) with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]], and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1943) with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[The Youngest Profession]]'' (1944) with the adolescent [[Virginia Weidler]].

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
By the mid-1940s, Moorehead joined [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract with the provision to perform also on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to play on radio as "the actors didn't have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show."<ref name="kear"/> In 1943–1944, Moorehead portrayed "matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet", who was constantly offering her "candied opinion", in Mutual Radio's ''[[The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall]]''; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.<ref>Cox, Jim, ''Radio Crime Fighters'', 2002, p. 18, McFarland, Jefferson, North Carolina, ISBN 0-7864-1390-5</ref>

Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries throughout her career. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap'n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM's hit 1951 remake of ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]''. She was in many important films, including ''[[Dark Passage (film)|Dark Passage]]'' and ''[[Since You Went Away]]'', either playing key small or large supporting parts. Moorehead was in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'' in 1951–1952, and ''Lord Pengo'' in 1962–1963.

===Radio===
During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''. During the 946-episode-run of ''Suspense'', Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the "first lady of ''Suspense''". Moorehead's most successful appearance on ''Suspense'' was in the legendary play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'', written by [[Lucille Fletcher]], broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for ''Suspense'' and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. [[Barbara Stanwyck]] had played the role in the [[Sorry, Wrong Number|1948 film version]].

In 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived ''Bringing up Father'' program on the [[Blue Network]]. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor's housekeeper in the radio version of ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. She also starred in ''The Amazing Mrs. Danberry'', a situation comedy on [[CBS]], in 1946. Moorehead's title character was described as "the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer."<ref name="dunningota">Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-507678-3. Pp. 120, 443, 24.</ref>

[[File:Agnes Moorehead - 1955.jpg|left|thumb|210px|In ''The Blue Veil'' (1951)]]

===More film===
In the 1950s, Moorehead continued to work in films and to appear on stage across the country, including a national tour of Shaw's ''[[Don Juan in Hell]]'', co-starring [[Charles Boyer]], [[Charles Laughton]], and [[Cedric Hardwicke]]. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney's hit film ''[[Pollyanna]]'' (1960). Alongside Bette Davis, Olivia De Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten, she starred in ''Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte'' (1964), as the maid, Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Academy Award]].

===Television===
In 1959, Moorehead guest starred on ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]''. Her role in the radio play ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' inspired writers of the CBS television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' to script an episode with Moorehead in mind.<ref>Richard J. Hand, ''Terror on the Air!: Horror Radio in America, 1931–1952''. McFarland, 2006. ISBN 0-7864-2367-6</ref> In "[[The Invaders (The Twilight Zone)|The Invaders]]" (broadcast January 27, 1961) Moorehead played a woman whose isolated farm is plagued by mysterious intruders. In "Sorry, Wrong Number", Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice, and for "The Invaders", she was offered a script where she had no dialogue at all.

Moorehead also had guest roles on ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]'', ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in "Incident at Poco Tiempo" as Sister Frances, and ''[[The Rifleman]]''. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in "The Night of the Vicious Valentine" on ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a performance for which she won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].

===''Bewitched''===
[[File:Agnes Moorehead Dick York Elizabeth Montgomery Bewitched 1964.JPG|thumb|Moorehead and ''[[Bewitched]]'' castmates [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Dick York]]]]

In 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha's ([[Elizabeth Montgomery]]) mortal-loathing, quick-witted [[witch]] mother, in the situation comedy ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success. However, she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, therefore allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the ''Bewitched'' scripts as "hack" in a 1965 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name=TVGuide>"Agnes Moorehead's recipe for TV success: The Strength of an  Amazon..." ''TV Guide''. July 17–23, 1965</ref> The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as ''Bewitched'' was in the top 10 programs for the first few years it screened.

Moorehead received six [[Emmy Award]] nominations, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career. Despite her ambivalence, she remained with ''Bewitched'' until its run ended in 1972. She commented to the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1974, "I've been in movies and played theater from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before ''Bewitched'', and I don't particularly want to be identified as a witch." Later that year she said she had enjoyed playing the role, but  it was not challenging and the show itself was "not breathtaking", although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show's star, Elizabeth Montgomery, and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star [[Dick Sargent]], who in 1969 replaced the ill [[Dick York]] as Samantha's husband, Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, caustically describing her as "a tough old bird."<ref name="kear">{{Cite book |last= Kear |first= Lynn |title= Agnes Moorehead: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1992 |publisher= Greenwood Press, Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-28155-6 |page= 12 }}</ref>

===Later years===
In 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early ''[[Night Gallery]]'' episode "Certain Shadows on the Wall". She also reprised her role in ''Don Juan in Hell'' on Broadway and on tour, in an all-star cast which also featured [[Edward Mulhare]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], and [[Paul Henreid]].

Moorehead also memorably supplied the voice of the friendly Mother Goose in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1973 adaptation of the [[E. B. White]] children's book ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.

For the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 Broadway adaptation of ''Gigi'']], Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including "The Contract" for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, forcing [[Arlene Francis]] to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.

In January 1974, three months before her death, Moorehead performed in two episodes (including the first) of ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the popular series produced by old-time radio master [[Himan Brown]].

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee in 1930; they divorced in 1952. Moorehead and Lee adopted an orphan named Sean in 1949, but it remains unclear whether the adoption was legal, although Moorehead did raise the child until he ran away from home. In 1954, she married actor [[Robert Gist]]; they divorced in 1958.

===Sexuality===
Within the entertainment community, Moorehead was widely believed to be a [[lesbian]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Creekmur|first=Corey K.and Alexander Doty|title=Out in Culture: Gay, Lesbian, and Queer Essays on Popular Culture|year=1995|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0-304-33488-X|page=111|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HeXgksZhfgQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In an interview, [[Paul Lynde]], Moorehead's occasional co-star on ''Bewitched'', said: "Well, the whole world knows Agnes was a lesbian--I mean classy as hell, but one of the all-time Hollywood dykes".<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Patricia|title=Uninvited: Classical Hollywood Cinema and Lesbian Representability|year=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington IN|isbn=0-253-33641-4|page=140|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gPxwl7uSYfYC&printsec=frontcover&vq=moorehead#v=onepage&q=moorehead&f=false}}</ref> Journalist [[Boze Hadleigh]] has reported an incident in which, when she caught one of her husbands cheating on her, "Agnes screamed at him that if he could have a mistress, so could she".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hadleigh|first=Boze|title=Hollywood Lesbians|year=1994|publisher=Barricade Books|location=Fort Lee NJ|isbn=978-1569800140|page=179}}</ref> In an interview, Moorehead acknowledged her same-sex orientation while identifying a number of other Hollywood actresses who "enjoyed lesbian or bi relationships".<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrams|first=Brett L.|title=Hollywood Bohemians: Transgressive Sexuality and the Selling of the Movieland Dream|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson NC|isbn=978-0786439294|page=129}}</ref>

===Political Views===
Moorehead was a staunch conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who believed in less government intervention and tax cuts. She also supported her close friend [[Ronald Reagan]] for his 1966 run for governor.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=X8GQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267&dq=Agnes+Moorehead+Republican&source=bl&ots=B9OmA7JBf7&sig=i8NzObrIlX44mGO5q1r6KPM4GK8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=E2f8VK3lDIufyQTJkYGwDQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Agnes%20Moorehead%20Republican&f=false</ref>

==Death==
Moorehead died of [[uterine cancer]] on April 30, 1974, in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]; she is buried at Dayton Memorial Park in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. In 1994, Moorehead was posthumously inducted into the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

The [[Touchdown Tavern]] in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, opened the Agnes Moorehead Lounge, exhibiting [[memorabilia]].

Moorehead bequeathed her 1967 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] statue for ''The Wild Wild West'', her private papers, and her home in Rix Mills, Ohio, to her ''alma mater'', Muskingum College. She left her family's Ohio estate and farmlands, Moorehead Manor, to [[Bob Jones University]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[South Carolina]], as well as some biblical studies books from her personal library. Her will stipulated that BJU should use the farm for retreats and special meetings "with a Christian emphasis", but the distance of the estate from the South Carolina campus rendered it mostly useless. In May 1976, BJU traded the Moorehead farmlands with an Ohio college for $25,000 and a collection of her library books. Moorehead also left her professional papers, scripts, Christmas cards, and scrapbooks to the [[Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research]] at the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]].

===''The Conqueror'' and Cancer===
Moorehead appeared in the 1956 movie ''[[The Conqueror (film)|The Conqueror]]'', which was filmed near [[St. George, Utah]]—[[downwinders|downwind]] from the [[Yucca Flat Test Site|Yucca Flat, Nevada, nuclear test site]]. She was one of over 90 (of 220) cast and crew members — including co-stars [[Susan Hayward]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Pedro Armendariz]], as well as director-producer [[Dick Powell]] — who developed cancer; at least 46 died from the disease.<ref name=curse/> However, these rates of cancer are almost identical to the general population, in which 43% may be expected to contract cancer in their lifetimes, and 23% die from it.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Cancer Society|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer}}</ref> Nonetheless, speculations of a connection persist.

No bombs were tested during the filming of ''The Conqueror'', but 11 explosions occurred the year prior. Two of them were particularly "dirty", depositing long-lasting radiation over the area. The 51.5-kiloton shot (code name "Simon") was fired on April 25, 1953, and the 32.4-kiloton blast (code name "Harry") went off May 19. (In contrast, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was 16 kilotons.<ref>http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html#nfaq8.1.3</ref>) "Fallout was very abundant more than a year after 'Harry'", said former AEC researcher Robert C. Pendleton.<ref name=curse>{{cite web | author = Michael D. Shaw| title = Was The Movie The Conqueror Really Cursed? A Look At Radiation Paranoia | url = http://www.gasdetection.com/Interscan_News/health_news_digest225.html | work =  | publisher = HealthNewsDigest.com | date = September 14, 2009| accessdate = 2013-09-09}}</ref> "Some of the isotopes, such as [[strontium 90]] and [[cesium 137]], would not have diminished much."<ref name=curse/> Pendleton pointed out that radioactivity can concentrate in "hot spots" such as the rolling dunes of Snow Canyon, a natural reservoir for windblown material, which was where much of ''The Conqueror'' was filmed.<ref name=curse/>

Pendleton noted that radioactive substances enter the food chain. By eating local meat and produce, ''The Conqueror'' cast and crew were increasing their risk. Pendleton, director of radiological health at the [[University of Utah]], stated, "With these numbers, this case could qualify as an epidemic. The connection between fallout radiation and cancer in individual cases has been practically impossible to prove conclusively. But in a group this size you'd expect only 30-some cancers to develop. With 91, I think the tie-in to their exposure on the set of ''The Conqueror'' would hold up even in a court of law."<ref name=curse/> On the other hand, Pendleton's number has been questioned <ref>{{cite web| publisher=National Cancer Institute| title=Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer| date=2013-08-23| url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer|accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref> by the National Cancer Institute, which states that a random group of 220 people, 96 should have cancer at some point in their lives, and that rate has been essentially the same throughout the 20th century, trending slowly upwards as longer lifetimes are experienced. Later inquiries into the deaths of the crew of ''The Conqueror'' have revolved around extreme cigarette usage among them.<ref name=curse /><ref>{{cite web|date=2010-01-29|title=The Tobacco Celebs: Wayne For Camels|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=john-wayne-cancer|accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref>

Moorehead was one of the first members of the company to perceive a connection between the film and the fallout. Her friend [[Sandra Gould]], who was featured with her on ''Bewitched'', recalls that long before Moorehead developed the uterine cancer that killed her in 1974, she recounted rumors of "some radioactive germs" on location in Utah, observing: "Everybody in that picture has gotten cancer and died." As she was dying, she reportedly said: "I should never have taken that part."<ref name=People>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077825,00.html |title=The Children of John Wayne, Susan Hayward and Dick Powell Fear That Fallout Killed Their Parents |author=Karen G.
