'''''The Colbert Report''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛr|_|r|ə|ˈ|p|ɔr}}) <!--Do not change to "was", per WP:TVLEAD.-->is an American [[late night television|late-night]] [[Late-night talk show|talk]] and [[news satire]] [[television program]] hosted by [[Stephen Colbert]] that aired on [[Comedy Central]] from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert]], played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status [[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]", is a caricature of televised political [[pundit]]s. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly [[Fox News]]' ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. ''The Colbert Report'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'', where he acted as a [[correspondent]] for the program for several years while developing the character.

The program was created by Colbert, [[Jon Stewart]], and [[Ben Karlin]]. The show's writing was grounded in [[improvisation]], and often lampooned [[current events]] stories. The show's structure also included a guest interview, in which the Colbert character attempts to deconstruct his opponent's argument. The show was taped in [[New York City]]'s [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, and the program's set is "hyper-American," epitomizing the character's ego. The show was taped and broadcast Monday through Thursday, with weeks taken off at multiple points in a given year for breaks.

''The Colbert Report'' saw immediate critical and ratings successes, leading to various awards, including two prestigious [[Peabody Award]]s. The show's [[Cultural impact of The Colbert Report|cultural influence]]—which occasionally would require a fair degree of participation from the show’s audience, dubbed the Colbert Nation—extended beyond the program a number of times. This impact included the character running for [[U.S. President]] twice, co-hosting a [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|rally]] at the [[National Mall]], presenting a [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|controversial performance]] at the [[White House Correspondents' Association|White House Correspondents' Dinner]], and opening a real [[Colbert Super PAC|Super PAC]] that raised a million dollars. In addition, the show inspired various forms of multimedia, including music and multiple best-selling books.

==Background==

''The Colbert Report'' satirized conservative personality-driven political [[pundit]] programs, and focused on a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert]], played by his real-life namesake. The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'' in 1996, described as "a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop."<ref name="NYT"/> Colbert first joined [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in 1997, a year following its launch, then hosted by [[Craig Kilborn]]. When [[Jon Stewart]] became the program's host in 1999, ''The Daily Show'' developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Colbert recalled that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gross, Terry|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title=A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|work=Fresh Air|date=January 20, 2005|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> He commented that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on "human interest-y" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more "issues and news driven", particularly after the beginning of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] campaign with which the show dealt in its "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]" coverage.<ref name="Colbert interview">{{cite web|author=Plume, Ken|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/433/433111p1.html|title=An Interview with Stephen Colbert|publisher=IGN|date=August 11, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Jacqueline|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title=So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]]|date=May 6, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref>

Colbert became a fixture on ''The Daily Show'', occasionally hosting in Stewart's absence.<ref name="VF"/> In 2003, the program began running advertisements for a fictional program titled ''The Colbert Réport'', starring Colbert as a parody of cable news pundits.<ref name="NYT"/> When fellow ''Daily Show'' star [[Steve Carell]] left to pursue a film and television career, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. He pitched ''The Colbert Report'' to the channel in 2004. Stewart pushed Comedy Central to pick up the show, and Colbert was given an eight-week tryout. Following the show's immediate success, the show "quickly became a fixture in the late-night lineup."<ref name="NYT"/> On November 2, 2005, based on the strong [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show's first two weeks, Comedy Central and Colbert announced they had signed for an additional year, through the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/index.jsp?tnews| title=Comedy Central Keeps Colbert| first=Charlie| last=Amter| date=November 2, 2005| publisher=[[E!

==History==
===Development===
[[File:Jon Stewart 2005.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The show is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], seen here in 2005.]]
The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'' in 1996, described as "a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop."<ref name="NYT"/>

When ''The Daily Show'' ran short on time, a short piece starring Colbert, advertising a fictional program titled ''The Colbert Réport'', were added into the program. In these sketches, Colbert began to amplify his character to parody news pundits.<ref name="VF"/> Colbert anchored many sketches in his persona, including "Even Stepvhen", in which he debated current issues with fellow correspondent [[Steve Carell]], often devolving into petty name-calling and insults.<ref name="NYT"/> Colbert and Carell were viewed as potential breakout stars by staff, and when Carell left the series in 2004 to start a US version of ''[[The Office]]'', Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network.<ref name="nymag"/> Stewart and Karlin were already looking to expand the ''Daily Show'' franchise and their production company, Busboy. The duo supposedly came up with the idea for ''The Colbert Report'' after watching coverage of the [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit filed against [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]. Colbert met with network president Doug Herzog the day following the 2004 Emmy Awards to first discuss the concept.<ref name="nymag"/> The one-line pitch Colbert, Karlin and Stewart developed was "Our version of ''the O'Reilly Factor'' with Stephen Colbert."<ref name="USATodayLevin">{{cite news| title=First 'Stewart,' now 'Colbert'| last=Levin| first=Gary | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-10-13-colbert_x.htm|work=USA Today| date=October 13, 2005 |accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> Herzog committed to an eight-week tryout period without a pilot.<ref name="NYT"/>

By the time of the 2004 election, the character was fully developed.<ref name="VF"/> In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be "an asshole," Stewart remarked, "You’re not an asshole. You’re an idiot. There’s a difference."<ref name="nymag"/> Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, "There is an essential innocence to his character."<ref name="splitsider"/> Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format.<ref name="NYT"/> Despite this, ''The Colbert Report'' was designed as an extension of the satiric goals of ''The Daily Show'', combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor.<ref name="splitsider"/> To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with ''The Daily Show'', Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts.<ref name="nymag"/> For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each ''Daily Show'' in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show.<ref name="WP05"/><ref name="NYT05"/>

The show's writing was grounded in [[improvisation]], employing a "yes to everything" mentality.<ref name="NYT"/> Much of the show's humor derived from extended improvisational games with the show's studio and at-home audience, such as Colbert's poll to name a bridge in Hungary after himself.<ref name="RS"/> Many of the show's writers have improvisational training and at one point put together "improv evenings" at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] once a month.<ref name="NYT"/> Writers on ''The Colbert Report'' were predominantly male and white; this lack of diversity was acknowledged by Colbert, who contended that writers were considered solely based on the quality of their material, and that he did not even look at the name on their writing packets before hiring them.<ref name="hp15"/> Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself.<ref name="ewnycf"/> Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an [[echo chamber]] of sorts.<ref name="RS"/> This led Colbert to describe his show, "at its purest expression, is a pebble that we throw into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples."<ref name="RS"/>

Ideas were considered in the show's morning pitch meeting, which could range from "harrowing" to smooth.<ref name="ewnycf"/> Colbert was described as having "demanding standards," quoted as remarking, "Let's make it perfect and then cut it."<ref name="NYT"/> Dozens of ideas were either implemented into the program, deleted, or saved for a later date (these jokes were often forgotten due to the pace of news).<ref name="NYT"/> Jokes would go unused if they did not specifically fit the character's point of view, which was deemed the inverse of what "any logical person" feels.<ref name="hp15"/> Writing for the program was once described as "all-consuming," leaving no time for outside activities.<ref name="NYT"/> Ideas with considerable potential are categorized into the "hopper" category, where it can be rewritten and developed, while more fully formed ideas are placed in what they deemed the "pantry."<ref name="ewnycf">{{cite journal|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/11/08/stephen-colbert-report-new-york-comedy-festival/|title=Stephen Colbert at the New York Comedy Festival: Ten things we learned|first=Shirley|last=Li|journal=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}</ref>

By 11am, a rough outline for the show would typically be completed and writers would be sent off in pairs to complete scripts, which are polished throughout the day.<ref name="NYT"/> Writers would then scan news articles for ideas and partner together in pairs, with one "keeping track of possible jokes."<ref name="ewnycf"/> During an appearance at the [[New York Comedy Festival]] in 2013, some writers admitted to procrastinating until the last hour before rehearsal to complete their sections; Colbert confirmed that segments such as ""The Wørd," in the early days of the program, were scripted entirely during the rewrite before rehearsal.<ref name="hp15"/><ref name="ewnycf"/> Both writers would typically act out their dialogue aloud in order to understand whether or not the Colbert character would say them.<ref name="splitsider"/> While writers are working on their respective scripts, the show's production and graphics team would be compiling music, footage, and props needed for the show.<ref name="splitsider"/> To collect video clips of news programs to comment on, the show would cross-reference transcripts of archived [[TiVo]] recordings.<ref>{{cite news|author= Tony Maglio |url=http://www.thewrap.com/the-secret-to-daily-show-colbert-report-and-the-soup-snapstream/|title=The Secret Weapon Behind ‘Daily Show,’ ‘Colbert Report’ and ‘The Soup’|website=[[The Wrap]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> In 2011, the show switched to the software [[SnapStream TV monitoring software|Snapstream]] which streamlined the process; the program searches [[closed captioning]] for select words and records hours of television.<ref>{{cite news|author= Richard Lawler|url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/24/the-daily-show-and-colbert-report-switching-up-video-capture-tec/|title=The Daily Show and Colbert Report changing video capture tech for the switch to HDTV|website=[[Engadget]]|date=December 24, 2009|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> In addition, a group of coders on the show's staff and independent contractors developed the software Scripto to collaboratively edit scripts in real time.<ref>{{cite news|author= Joshua Brustein |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-17/stephen-colberts-in-house-tech-startup-wants-to-fix-tv-scripts|title=The Colbert Report’s TV Production Software Is No Joke|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=June 17, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref>

By 1pm, the show would hold a second production meeting to go over the writers' scripts, and to determine which pieces to edit.<ref name="splitsider"/> Scripts were "hopefully" completed around 4pm, and the show's rehearsal would take place at 5:30pm, occasionally earlier.<ref name="splitsider"/> Following this rehearsal, attended by the entire staff, final changes were made to the show's script.<ref name="VF"/> The final rewrite would take place in a "small, red, poorly ventilated room" until 6:45pm.<ref name="splitsider"/><ref name="hp15">{{cite journal|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/the-colbert-report-writers-15-surprising-facts_n_4242916.html|title=15 Things You Might Not Know About ''The Colbert Report''|first=Katla|last=McGlynn|journal=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}</ref> Prior to interviewing guests, Colbert would meet with the guest in the [[green room]] and acknowledges that he is playing a character, noting that this character is "willfully ignorant of what you know and care about," and to "honestly disabuse me of what you see as my ignorance."<ref name="RS"/> Emily Lazar, a guest producer on the program, would advise guests to talk with Colbert as though he were a "harmless drunk at the next bar stool."<ref name="PB"/> Guests would typically take their seats around 7pm, when a warm-up comedian (which included Jared Logan and Paul Mercurio) delivered jokes.<ref name="bg"/> Colbert, out of character, typically held a brief question and answer session with the audience prior to taping.<ref name="RS"/> The show's taping could last up to three hours,<ref name=bg>{{cite journal| last =Simon| first =Clea| date =November 21, 2013| title =Waiting for the punchline: In the audience at ''The Colbert Report''| journal =[[The Boston Globe]] | url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2013/11/21/waiting-for-punchline-audience-the-colbert-report/9Vyy7RYyANjYu7jajc0fbK/story.html| accessdate =June 21, 2014}}</ref> and typically would around 9pm, after which the show was edited and sent to Comedy Central for broadcast.<ref name="NYT"/> After the taping, the staff would meet for one final time to work through details for the following night's show.<ref name="splitsider"/>

''The Colbert Report'' was taped and broadcast four nights a week, Monday–Thursday.<ref name="USATodayLevin"/> The show's taping studio, at 513 W. 54th Street in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, was used for ''The Daily Show'' until July 2005,<ref name="VF"/> and has a capacity of 150.<ref name="bg"/> NEP Studio 54 on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] is owned by [[NEP Broadcasting]] which is New York City's largest production facility and also owns ''The Daily Show'' set at NEP Studio 52 two blocks south on [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]].

The show's set was designed by Jim Fenhagen, and was intended to both capture the character's ego and be "hyper-American."<ref name="Linda"/> Elements incorporated into the set included architectural lines converged to Colbert's desk, and radial beams coming out from behind his chair.<ref name="RS"/> Colbert's main influence for the set was Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'',<ref name="avclub">{{cite news|url =http://www.avclub.com/articles/stephen-colbert,13970/|title = Stephen Colbert interview|first = Nathan|last = Rabin|work = [[The A.V.

"I kept saying, 'People might not really notice this.' But when you're working with a comedy team, they really get into it. They couldn't help themselves," said Fenhagen. Among these touches are the Constitution, miniature Ten Commandments, and a CliffNotes guide to American government.<ref name="Linda"/> The set was described as "part Riefenstahlesque homage to the star, part symbologic gallery — where alert viewers are rewarded with snarky jokes at every turn."<ref name="Linda">{{cite news | last =Tischler | first =Linda | title =Telly Visionary | date= November 2006 |journal=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]| url =http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/110/telly-visionary.html | accessdate = September 2, 2008 }}</ref> The graphics used throughout the show and the studio itself are saturated with [[United States flag|American flags]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[Captain America]]'s shield, and other patriotic imagery.<ref name="Verb! brands The Colbert Report">{{cite web | publisher =Studio Daily | title =Verb! brands The Colbert Report | date= October 28, 2005 | url =http://www.studiodaily.com/main/news/f/projects/5614.html | accessdate = September 2, 2008 }}</ref> In the set, "virtually every inch emblazoned with Colbert's name or the initial C."<ref name="WP05"/> The show debuted an updated set in January 2010.<ref name=nj>{{cite news|last=Rose|first=Lisa|title=Stephen Colbert interview: Speaking several decibels lower than expected|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/10/stephen_colbert_interview_s_pe.html|date=October 26, 2009|accessdate=October 26, 2009}}</ref>

Colbert's desk is in the shape of serifed C, standing for Colbert. On one wall, there is an artificial fireplace with the engraving "Videri Quam Esse," meaning, "to seem to be rather than to be"; it is a play off of the traditional Latin phrase "esse quam videri," or, "to be, rather than to seem to be," reflecting Colbert's mock right-wing personality. Above this fireplace is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself.

Colbert said "I don't mean to brag, but as it contains three portraits, my portrait has more portraits than any other portrait in the National Portrait Gallery!" The portrait was then put on display at the Smithsonian until April 13. On October 16, 2008, the three-deep portrait was officially donated to the permanent collection of the Smithsonian's American Treasures exhibit. In September 2009, the portrait was retired to the Smithsonian's collection. At the end of that show, a new 5-deep portrait was unveiled, with the newest Colbert holding his newly won Primetime Emmy Award with another Primetime Emmy Award and a Peabody by the mantle.

Club]]'', Colbert explained that much of the design for the set was inspired by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]''. "All the architecture of that room points at Jesus' head, the entire room is a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]", Colbert said. "On the set, I'd like the lines of the set to converge on my head. And so if you look at the design, it all does, it all points at my head...there's a sort of [[solar deity|sun-god]] burst quality about the set around me."<ref name="avclub" /> On the floor to the front stage right of his desk there is an eagle's nest, and a tape outline of where he injured his wrist, akin to those seen at murder scenes on television police procedurals.

For the week of April 14 through April 17, 2008, the program was taped at the [[Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus, in advance of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] primary in that state on April 22.

Typically, Colbert starts with the audience going insane and teasers regarding the show's topics and guest; each headline is structured to be a deliberate pun. The series of puns are followed by a verbal [[metaphor]] that promotes the show and is almost always finished with, "This is the ''Colbert Report''." The show's original opening title sequence began with an eagle diving past the host, following by images of Americana, stock footage of Colbert, and words describing Colbert flying by (some of which have been used as The Wørd). The first word used was "Grippy", and has changed to include, among others, <!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST-->"Megamerican", "Lincolnish", "Superstantial", "Flagaphile", and "Factose Intolerant".<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST--> The May 4 episode in 2009 featured "''346x''" as a hint planted by [[J. J. Abrams]] about when and where Colbert would be in the [[Persian Gulf]], and "Farewellison" for the final episode of former producer Allison Silverman.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The show's opening credits depict the Colbert character clutching an American flag.<ref name=NYT>{{cite journal| last =McGrath| first =Charles| date =January 4, 2012| title =How Many Stephen Colberts Are There?| journal =[[The New York Times]] | publisher =[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn = 0362-4331 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/magazine/stephen-colbert.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&| accessdate =June 5, 2014}}</ref>  On January 4, 2010, a new opening debuted. The opening begins and ends with an eagle as before, but features new background renderings, new shots of Stephen Colbert, and is now colored in an American, red white and blue motif. The show's [[theme music]] is "Baby Mumbles" by [[Cheap Trick]]. Colbert phoned guitarist [[Rick Nielsen]] during development of the show to discuss the theme, noting that he loved the band's song "[[I Want You to Want Me]]"; the show's theme music is largely that song's melody backwards.<ref name=cheaptrick>{{cite journal| last =DiCrescenzo| first =Brent| date =December 9, 2009| title =Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick – Interview| journal =[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] | url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/rick-nielsen-of-cheap-trick-interview| accessdate =June 5, 2014}}</ref>

Following the opening sequence, Colbert most often proceeds with a run-through of recent headlines in a manner parodying traditional news broadcasts; this is similar to ''The Daily Show'' but with a faux-[[right-wing politics|right-wing]] spin. The program typically continues with Colbert addressing a specific topic. Colbert often calls to "Jimmy", a reference to program director Jim Hoskinson, to roll video clips.<ref name="hp15"/> That topic will often lead into a "The Wørd" segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''{{'}}s "Talking Points Memo".<ref>{{cite news | first = Ryan | last = Nolan | title = Mock News Becomes Very Real Success | url = http://www.longislandpress.com/?cp=224&show=article&a_id=10293 | publisher = [[Long Island Press]] | date = November 16, 2006 | accessdate = September 2, 2008}}</ref> On occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone having to do with the topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of [[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report|recurring segments]], which may include "[[Better Know a District]]", in which Colbert interviews a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from a certain district of the United States; "Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; "Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.", a health segment; "The Sport Report" with the "t" in both Sport and Report silent, a sports segment; and "The ThreatDown", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others. His newest segment, "Thought for Food" deals with the consumption of specific foods across the world.

Sometimes, there is a "''Colbert Report Special Repor-t''" (the final 't' pronounced with special emphasis), or even a "''Colbert Report, Sport Report, Special Repor-t''", in which Colbert devotes a section of an episode, and sometimes the entire episode to a special subject. The third segment is almost always an interview with a celebrity guest, often an author or government official.<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = 'Colbert Report' to Get Best-Of DVD | url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/wire/sns-ap-tv-colbert-dvd,0,387970.story?coll=sns-ap-tv-headlines | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015182340/http://newsday.com/entertainment/tv/wire/sns-ap-tv-colbert-dvd,0,387970.story?coll=sns-ap-tv-headlines | archivedate=October 15, 2007 |work=Newsday | date= July 29, 2007 | accessdate = September 2, 2008}}</ref> Unlike the late night talk show standard of the guest walking out to the host’s desk, Colbert instead runs to a separate area of the set to interview his guest, basking in the applause and glory meant for the guest.<ref name="vulture14">{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/colbert-report-first-head-writer-remembers-allison-silverman.html?mid=twitter_vulture|title=The Colbert Report’s First Head Writer Remembers the Show’s Early Days and the Correspondents’ Dinner|author= Allison Silverman|date=December 17, 2014|accessdate=December 17, 2014|publisher=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]}}</ref> On the interview segment of the show, Colbert frequently attempts to nail his guest by using various [[rhetorical device]]s and [[fallacy|fallacies]] to prove them wrong.<ref name="nprgross">{{cite interview|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5040948| title=Bluster and Satire: Stephen Colbert's 'Report'| last=Colbert |first=Stephen |interviewer=[[Terry Gross]] |program=Fresh Air | date=December 7, 2005 |callsign=WHYY| accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> The real-life Colbert once remarked that his personal favorite segment of the program were the interviews, which involved more listening on his end in order for the character to "ignorantly deconstruct" his opponent's argument.<ref name="RS"/> The third segment of the show is on occasion a musical guest.

The character incorporates aspects of Colbert's real life, but is primarily a [[parody]] of cable news [[pundit (expert)|pundits]], particularly [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] of [[Fox News]]' ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', whom he refers to as "Papa Bear".<ref>{{cite news| last=Day|first=Patrick Kevin|title=Bill O'Reilly snarks on Stephen Colbert's new gig|date=February 19, 2007|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-bill-oreilly-snarks-on-stephen-colberts-new-gig-20140415,0,4551395.story#axzz2z3afIRS7|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> To this end, the character even incorporates O'Reilly's mannerisms, described as his "pen-wielding, hand-stabbing gestures."<ref name="NYT"/> O'Reilly's use of "talking points" — illustrated onscreen graphics reflecting the host's opinions — are parodied on ''The Colbert Report'' with the segment "The Wørd".<ref name=NYT05>{{cite journal| last =Steinberg| first =Jaques| date =October 12, 2005| title =The News Is Funny, as a Correspondent Gets His Own Show| journal =[[The New York Times]] | publisher =[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn = 0362-4331 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/12/arts/television/12colb.html?incamp=article_popular&_r=0&pagewanted=1| accessdate =June 5, 2014}}</ref>  He initially incorporated long-winded, verbose metaphors to parody CNN correspondent Aaron Brown.<ref name="NYT05"/> In addition, the character was also heavily inspired by [[Stone Phillips]], [[Bill Kurtis]] and "especially" [[Geraldo Rivera]].

====Early years====
''The Colbert Report'' premiered in October 2005.

===Controversy===
''The Colbert Report'' has on occasion created controversy. In March 2014, the show attracted controversy when Colbert used a "fatuously fake parody stereotype character, 'Ching-Chong Ding-Dong,'" to "satirize knee-jerk mockery" of [[Languages of Asia|Asian dialect]].<ref name="WSJasian"/> The name had been used before without incident, but the show's official [[Twitter]] account — run by an unknown individual — tweeted the remarks without context, leading to wide outrage over [[social media]], including a [[hashtag]] campaign, "#CancelColbert," that was a worldwide trending topic for over 24 hours, thanks in-part by Colbert himself helping make it go viral for his show.<ref name="WSJasian">{{cite journal|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/29/stephen-colbert-racism-and-the-weaponized-hashtag/|title=Stephen Colbert, Racism and the Weaponized Hashtag|first=Jeff|last=Yang|journal=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=March 29, 2014|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Legacy and accolades==
{{Main|Cultural impact of The Colbert Report}}
{{see also|Vandalism on Wikipedia#Stephen_Colbert}}
''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that "Colbert has made vital observations about the American political system, particularly about the sordid role that money plays within it. ''The Colbert Report'' and the ''Daily Show'' [...] have changed the way that young liberals of a certain class think and talk about civic culture."<ref name="newyorker14">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-real-colbert-will-triumph-on-late-night|title=The Real Colbert Will Triumph on Late Night|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=April 11, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

The show also coined another word, ''wikiality'', that means "reality as decided on majority rule." Viewers of the show also coined a word, ''freem'', based on its inclusion in the show's opening sequence; the word refers to "'freedom' without having to 'do' anything — without any responsibility or action."<ref name="splitsider"/> In response to the "Better Know a District" segment, [[Rahm Emanuel]], then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show in 2007.<ref name="The Hill">{{cite news | last =Kaplan | first =Jonathan E. | title =Emanuel tells freshmen to avoid Stephen Colbert | publisher =[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date=  2007-03-14 | url = http://thehill.com/homenews/news/11329-emanuel-tells-freshmen-to-avoid-stephen-colbert | accessdate = 2014-04-11 }}</ref> In 2008, [[East Carolina University]] associate professor [[Jason Bond]] named a species of [[trapdoor spider]] ''[[Aptostichus stephencolberti]]'' in honor of Stephen Colbert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25724187/|title=Spider to be named for Stephen Colbert - Celebrities|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref>

The "Colbert Bump" is defined, connotatively by the ''Report'', as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on ''The Colbert Report'', they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to the [[American Political Science Association]], contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/colbert_bump.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Colbert Bump in Campaign Donations: More Truthful than Truthy |journal=PS: Political Science & Politics |issue=3 |volume=41 |pages=533–539 |date=July 2008 |author=[[James H.

Viewers of ''The Colbert Report'' were on numerous occasions cited as being more knowledgeable about current events than traditional news viewers. In April 2007, a [[Pew Research Center]] report cited both ''Colbert'' and ''The Daily Show'' viewers as more well-informed than those who gathered their information via newspapers, television news and radio.<ref name="VF"/> Colbert's Super PAC coverage was widely lauded, and studies later found that this coverage was more effective than traditional news programs at educating the audience on campaign finance. He was awarded a [[Peabody Award]] for the parody, which was described as an "innovative means of teaching American viewers about the landmark court decision".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/04/05/stephen-colberts-super-pac-satire-lands-him-a-peabody/ |title=Stephen Colbert’s Super PAC Satire Lands Him a Peabody &#124; NewsFeed &#124; TIME.com |publisher=Newsfeed.time.com |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref> The [[Annenberg Public Policy Center]] reported in 2014 that the Colbert Super PAC segments increased viewers' knowledge of PAC and 501(c)(4) campaign finance regulation more successfully than other types of news media.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/Stephen_Colberts_super_Super_PAC_lesson_taught.html |title=Penn study: Colbert's civics lesson 'not just a proliferation of jokes' |first=Sam |last=Wood |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=June 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15205436.2014.891138 |title=Stephen Colbert's Civics Lesson: How Colbert Super PAC Taught Viewers About Campaign Finance |work=Mass Communication and Society |volume=17 |issue=3 |year=2014 |first1=Bruce W. |last1=Hardy |first2=Jeffrey A. |last2=Gottfried |first3=Kenneth M. |last3=Winneg |first4=Kathleen Hall |last4=Jamieson |pages=329–353 |doi=10.1080/15205436.2014.891138}}</ref>

==International distribution==
Outside the United States, ''The Colbert Report'' has been shown in Canada on [[The Comedy Network]], simultaneously with its original U.S. broadcast, since shortly after its debut. On September 22, 2014, due to The Comedy Network's acquisition of Canadian rights to ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', the program began airing on [[M3 (Canadian TV channel)|M3]] and did so for the remainder of the show's run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m3tv.ca/the-colbert-report-is-coming-to-m3/|title=The Colbert Report Is Coming To M3!|publisher=[[M3 (Canadian TV channel)|M3]]|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref> The decision to move the program may have also been influenced by The Comedy Network not owning Canadian rights to Colbert's next program, ''[[Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'', which are currently held by [[Omni Television]].

It airs on [[The Comedy Channel]] in Australia, [[Comedy Central New Zealand|Comedy Central]] in New Zealand, and on [[Maxxx]] in the [[Philippines]].

The show was shown during prime time on Australia's free-to-air [[ABC2]] in 2010, however the channel was outbid for rights for 2011.<ref>[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/11/colbert-coming-to-abc2.html Colbert coming to ABC2].

Several international markets also air ''The Colbert Report Global Edition'', which shows highlights from the previous week's shows and includes a special introduction by Stephen Colbert at the start of the program. This means a new or newly repackaged episode can be screened every weekday.

In addition most recent episodes (usually 3 weeks back) are available in full length on colbertnation.com. However some international audiences are unable to view the videos or episodes.

Referred to as a "pure extension" of the show in book form,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ''I Am America (And So Can You!)'' was released on October 9, 2007. Written by Stephen Colbert and ''The Colbert Report'' writers, the book covers Colbert's opinions on a wide array of topics not addressed on the show. Red [[Margin (typography)|margin]] notes appear throughout the book, providing reactions and counterpoints to Colbert's arguments in a style comparable to the ''Report''{{'}}s Wørd segment. The book draws some influence from and also parodies the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' (2000) and [[Sean Hannity]]'s ''[[Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism|Deliver Us From Evil]]'' (2005), which Colbert says he "forced" himself to read as a reference.<ref>[[Stephen Colbert|Colbert, Stephen]] (October 16, 2007).
