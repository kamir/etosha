'''Margaret Jane Pauley''' (born October 31, 1950), better known as '''Jane Pauley''', is an [[United States|American]] television anchor and journalist, and has been involved in news reporting since 1975. She is best known for her 13-year tenure on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' program, followed by 12 years as co-host of ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', and for her public acknowledgements of her struggle with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Jane_pauley.html|title=Jane Pauley: Interview by Chet Cooper and Dr. Gillian Friedman''|publisher=Abilitymagazine.com|accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

==Early life==
Pauley competed in debate and public speaking tournaments through the Indiana High School Forensic Association while enrolled at [[Warren Central High School (Indiana)|Warren Central High School]] in Indianapolis, which she graduated from in 1968.  She subsequently earned a scholarship to [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], where she was involved in the [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] sorority. After college, she worked from 1972 to 1975 at [[WISH-TV|WISH]] in Indianapolis and from 1975 to 1976 at [[WMAQ-TV|WMAQ]] in [[Chicago]] while also having a house in [[Pittsburgh]] where her sister went to work for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tstRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6m0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=today%20show%20pittsburgh&pg=6494%2C5595147|title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - Google News Archive Search|work=Google.com|accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> From there, she joined [[Television network|network television]].

==Career==
===''Today''===
From 1976 to 1989 Pauley was the co-host, with [[Tom Brokaw]] from 1976–81 and [[Bryant Gumbel]] from 1982–89, of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]''. She also anchored the Sunday edition of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' from 1980-82. Following in the footsteps, both in career and in style, of the first female anchor of the show, [[Barbara Walters]], she became a symbol for professional women, more specifically, female journalists. In her autobiography, ''And So It Goes'', Pauley's colleague [[Linda Ellerbee]] wrote, "She (Pauley) is what I want to be when I grow up". NBC briefly experimented with a trio of anchors, Pauley, Gumbel, and [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]], before returning to a co-anchor format with Gumbel.{{citation needed|date = December 2013}}

In 1989, following months of conjecture about Pauley's publicly reported dislike of the grueling morning assignment and ambition to work in prime-time television, she announced her resignation from ''Today.'' Speculation in the media seemed to imply that NBC executives had eased her out to advance younger NBC newscaster [[Deborah Norville]], who had begun to play a larger role in the two-hour morning program.

After leaving ''The Today Show'', Pauley hosted ''[[Real Life with Jane Pauley]]'' and served as deputy anchor for ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''.

In 1990, Pauley co-hosted the [[42nd Primetime Emmy Awards]], alongside [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Jay Leno]].<ref>

===''Dateline NBC''===
From 1992 to 2003, Pauley co-hosted NBC's ''Dateline NBC''. On February 9, 1993, at the end of a regularly scheduled edition of Dateline, Pauley, along with co-host [[Stone Phillips]], delivered a public apology to [[General Motors]] on behalf of NBC. While Pauley had no connection to the story, the apology was apparently part of a settlement of a lawsuit resulting from the [[Dateline NBC#General Motors vs. NBC|now debunked 1993 report]] which aired on Dateline on November 17, 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305709,00.html|title=Dateline Disaster|publisher=Ew.com|accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/LIE/nbc.html|title=Where NBC Went Wrong|publisher=Ew.com|accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/us/nbc-settles-truck-crash-lawsuit-saying-test-was-inappropriate.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=NBC Settles Truck Crash Lawsuit, Saying Test Was 'Inappropriate'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref>

===''The Jane Pauley Show''===
{{citation needed span|text=In 2004, Pauley returned to television as host of ''[[The Jane Pauley Show]]'', a syndicated daytime talk show. On the show, she discussed her bipolar disorder at length.

==Personal life==
The timing of her announcement that she is diagnosed with bipolar disorder coincided with the release of her autobiography, ''Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue'' (2004) and the launch of her daytime talk show.<ref>{{cite news| author =| title =Jane Pauley shares her story| quote =Most at NBC didn't know about her illness or that during a leave from the network, she'd been admitted to a psychiatric clinic.| newspaper =[[NBC News]]| date = September 4, 2004| url =http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5887567/ns/dateline_nbc-books/t/jane-pauley-shares-her-story/#.VVbl9mYnhPQ| accessdate =May 16, 2015}}</ref>

In October 2006, Pauley and her lawyers filed a lawsuit against ''[[The New York Times]]'' for allegedly duping her into lending her name and likeness to an advertising supplement popular with drug companies.
