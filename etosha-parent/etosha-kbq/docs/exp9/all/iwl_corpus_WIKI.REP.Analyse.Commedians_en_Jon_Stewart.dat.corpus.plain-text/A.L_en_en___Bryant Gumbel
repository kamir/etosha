==Life and career==

===Early life===

He is the son of Rhea Alice (née LeCesne), a city clerk, and Richard Dunbar Gumbel, a judge.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/11/Bryant-Gumbel.html Bryant Gumbel Biography]</ref> He attended and graduated from [[De La Salle Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], while growing up on the South Side of the city. He graduated from [[Bates College]] in 1970. In 1971, he became editor of ''[[Black Sports Magazine]]'', leaving the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/gumbel-bryant-1948 |title=Gumbel, Bryant (1948– ) &#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date= |accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/78078%7c0/Bryant-Gumbel/ |title=Overview for Bryant Gumbel |publisher=Tcm.com |date= |accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fitzhenry |first=Joseph |url=http://www.maristmy575.com/?p=8882 |title=Bryant Gumbel speaks his mind to students and faculty |publisher=Maristmy575.com |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>  Gumbel began his television career in October 1972, when he was made a sportscaster for [[KNBC-TV]] out of Los Angeles.

===Professional career===

====NBC Sports====
Gumbel was hired by [[NBC Sports]] in the fall of 1975 as co-host of its [[National Football League]] pre-game show ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#GrandStand|GrandStand]]'' with [[Jack Buck]]. From 1975 until January 1982 (when he left to do ''The Today Show'') Gumbel hosted numerous sporting events for NBC including [[Major League Baseball on NBC|Major League Baseball]], [[College Basketball on NBC|college basketball]] and the [[NFL on NBC|National Football League]]. Gumbel returned to sportscasting for NBC when he hosted the prime time [[Olympics on NBC|coverage]] of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] from [[Seoul]] and the [[PGA Tour on NBC|PGA Tour]] in 1990.

One of Gumbel's more memorable moments during his time at NBC Sports occurred in 1982, when he was on-site for the "[[The Epic in Miami|Epic in Miami]]" NFL playoff game between the [[1981 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] and [[1981 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. At the end of the game, Gumbel told the viewing audience "If you didn't like this football game then you don't like football!"

====''Today''====
Gumbel began his affiliation with ''Today'' as the program's chief sports reporter contributing twice-weekly features to the program, including a regular series entitled "Sportsman of the Week," featuring up-and-coming athletes. In June 1981, NBC announced that [[Tom Brokaw]] would depart ''Today'' to anchor the ''NBC Nightly News'' with [[Roger Mudd]] beginning in the spring of 1982. The search for Brokaw's replacement was on, and the initial candidates were all NBC News correspondents, including [[John Palmer (TV journalist)|John Palmer]], [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]], [[Bob Kur]], [[Bob Jamieson]], and [[Jessica Savitch]]. The candidates auditioned for Brokaw's job throughout the summer of 1981 when Brokaw was on vacation. Gumbel became a candidate for the job just by chance when he served as a last-minute substitute for ''Today'' co-anchor [[Jane Pauley]] in August 1981. Gumbel so impressed executive producer Steve Friedman and other NBC executives that he quickly became a top contender for the ''Today'' anchor position. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

While Friedman and other NBC executives favored Gumbel as Brokaw's replacement, another contingent within the NBC News division felt strongly that Brokaw should be replaced by a fellow news correspondent, not a sports reporter. Chris Wallace was the favored candidate of then-NBC News president Bill Small. NBC News decided to split the difference, selecting Gumbel as the program's anchor and Wallace as the Washington-based anchor. Jane Pauley would remain co-anchor in New York. Brokaw signed off of ''Today'' on December 18, 1981, and Gumbel replaced Brokaw on January 4, 1982.

The Gumbel-Pauley-Wallace arrangement, known internally as the "Mod Squad," lasted only nine months. It was an arrangement that proved intriguing on paper but unwieldy on television. Gumbel served as the show's traffic cop, opening and closing the program and conducting New York-based interviews, but Pauley and Wallace handled newsreading duties, and Wallace conducted all Washington-based hard news interviews. With ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' in first place and expanding its lead, NBC News made Gumbel the principal anchor of ''Today'' beginning September 27, 1982, with Jane Pauley as his co-anchor. Wallace became chief White House correspondent covering President Reagan, and John Palmer, previously a White House correspondent, became ''Today'''s New York-based news anchor.

Gumbel and Pauley had a challenging first two years together as ''Today'' anchors as they sought to find a rhythm as a team. ''Good Morning America'' solidified its lead over ''Today'' in the ratings during the summer of 1983, and Pauley's departure for maternity leave sent ''Today'' into a ratings tailspin. But when Pauley returned in February 1984, she and Gumbel began to work well together as a team. NBC took ''Today'' on the road in the fall of '84, sending Gumbel to the Soviet Union for an unprecedented series of live broadcasts from Moscow. Gumbel won plaudits for his performance in Moscow, erasing any doubts about his hard-news capabilities. That Moscow trip began a whirlwind period of travel for ''Today''. Remote broadcasts from Vietnam, Vatican City, Europe, South America, and much of the United States followed between 1984 and 1989. ''Today'' began to regain its old ratings dominance against ''[[Good Morning America]]'' throughout 1985, and by early 1986, the NBC program was once again atop the ratings.

In 1989, Gumbel, who was already known for his strong management style as ''Today'' anchor, wrote a memo to ''Today'' executive producer Marty Ryan, on Ryan's request, critiquing the program and identifying its shortcomings. Many of Gumbel's criticisms were directed at fellow ''Today'' staffers. This memo was leaked to the press. In the memo, Gumbel commented that [[Willard Scott]], "holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste...This guy is killing us and no one's even trying to rein him in". He commented that [[Gene Shalit]]'s movie reviews "are often late and his interviews aren't very good."<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/4066132.html?dids=4066132&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Mar+1%2C+1989&author=Collins%2C+Monica&pub=USA+TODAY&edition=&startpage=D1&desc=Memo+to+NBC%3A+We+Love+Scott Monica Collins, "Memo to NBC: We Love Scott", ''[[USA Today]]'', March 1, 1989.]</ref>

There was enough negative backlash in regard to Gumbel's comments toward Scott that Gumbel was shown making up with Scott on ''Today''.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/55908252.html?dids=55908252:55908252&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+14%2C+1989&author=Brian+Donlon&pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=01.D&desc=On+%60Today%2C%27+it%27s+kiss+and+make+up Brian Donlon, "On ''Today'', it's kiss and make up", ''[[USA Today]], March 14, 1989]</ref>

Following Jane Pauley's departure from ''Today'' in December 1989, Gumbel was joined by [[Deborah Norville]] in a short-lived partnership that lasted just over a year. ''Today'' dropped to second place in the ratings during this period as a result of intensely negative publicity surrounding Norville's replacement of Pauley, and Gumbel's feud with Scott. Norville was replaced by [[Katie Couric]] in April 1991, and the Gumbel-Couric team helped refocus ''Today'' as the morning news program on public affairs during the 1992 presidential campaign. The program returned to first place in the ratings in December 1995.

Gumbel's work on ''Today'' earned him several [[Emmys]] and a large group of fans. He is the third longest serving co-host of ''Today'', after current host [[Matt Lauer]] and [[Katie Couric]]. Gumbel stepped down from the show on 3 January 1997 after 15 years.

Since his departure, Gumbel has made occasional appearances on ''Today''. He appeared for the show's 60th anniversary and hosted along with Matt Lauer and Jane Pauley on December 30, 2013.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-bryant-gumbel-jane-pauley-return-to-today-20131230,0,4410436.story#axzz2pAmr1100 Patrick Kevin Day, "Bryant Gumbel, Jane Pauley return to Today" ''[[Los Angeles Times]], December 30, 2013]</ref>

====''Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel''====

After 15 years on the Today show, Bryant Gumbel moved to CBS to host a new prime time news-magazine called "Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel" during the 1997–1998 television season. The episode "The Reckoning" won a [[Peabody Award]] in 1998.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-reckoning 58th Annual Peabody Awards], May 1999.</ref> The show lasted just one season before being cancelled. The show aired on Wednesday nights at 9pm ET before moving to Tuesdays at 9pm ET.<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0196045.html</ref><ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/eye-ratings-cbs-replaces-gumbel-exec-article-1.793868</ref>

====''The Early Show''====
After leaving the ''Today Show'' and ''Dateline NBC'' in 1997, Gumbel moved to [[CBS]], where he hosted various shows before becoming co-host of the network's morning show ''[[The Early Show]]'' on November 1, 1999. Gumbel left ''The Early Show'' (and CBS that same year) in May 2002. He returned to his morning television roots when, in the spring and summer of 2010, he served as special guest moderator of ABC's "The View" for multiple days.

Gumbel was hosting the Early Show on the morning of September 11, 2001. He was the first to announce to CBS viewers of the [[September 11 attacks|attack on the World Trade Center]].

=====''Boy Scouts Incident''=====
A [[CBS]] camera caught a disgusted Bryant Gumbel blurting out "What a fucking idiot" just after he had finished a hostile interview with Robert Knight of the [[Family Research Council]] (FRC). The incident occurred at about 7:15&nbsp;a.m. ET on Thursday, June 29, 2000 following Knight's appearance to defend the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] policy of excluding [[Homosexuality|gays]] from being leaders. The [[Media Research Center]] reported that he uttered those words; Gumbel openly admitted to saying so when guest-hosting a June 2007 episode of ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Brent|title="F***ing Idiot" Outburst by Gumbel; Donaldson Also Dissed a Conservative|url=http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/2000/cyb20000630_extra.asp|work=CyberAlert|publisher=Media Research Center|date=June 30, 2000|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}{{cite news|title=CBS News Anchor Bryant Gumbel Says He Was Right to Call Pro-Family Advocate a F***ing Idiot|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2007/jun/07060604.html|work=LifeSiteNews.com|date=June 6, 2007|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>

====''Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel''====
Gumbel has concentrated most of his energy recently on his duties as host of [[HBO]]'s acclaimed investigative series ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'' (a show that he has hosted since 1995). HBO's web page claims that ''Real Sports'' has been described as "flat out TV's best sports program" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/realsports/about/ HBO: Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel – About the Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2012.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/real-sports-with-bryant-gumbel 71st Annual Peabody Awards], May 2013.</ref>

=====Controversial remarks=====
In February 2006, Gumbel made remarks regarding the Winter Olympics and the lack of African-American participation.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&id=2337773</ref>{{cquote|So try not to laugh when someone says these are the world's greatest athletes despite a paucity of blacks that makes the Winter Games look like a GOP convention.}}

On the August 15, 2006 episode of ''Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'', Gumbel made the following remarks about former NFL commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] and Players' Union president [[Gene Upshaw]] and directed these comments to new commissioner [[Roger Goodell]]: {{cquote|Before he cleans out his office have Paul Tagliabue show you where he keeps Gene Upshaw's leash. By making the docile head of the players union his personal pet, your predecessor has kept the peace without giving players the kind of guarantees other pros take for granted. Try to make sure no one competent ever replaces Upshaw on your watch.}}

In response, Tagliabue said: {{cquote|What Gumbel said about Gene Upshaw and our owners is about as irresponsible as anything I've heard in a long time.<ref>
[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2006-08-21-gumbel-upshaw_x.htm Michael McCarthy, "Gumbel's remarks strike ill chord with Tagliabue", ''[[USA Today]]'', 22 August 2006.]</ref>}}

On the October 18, 2011&nbsp;episode, Gumbel evoked [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in his criticism of NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] over the [[2011 NBA lockout|league's lockout]].<ref>http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-hawks/hbos-bryant-gumbel-calls-1205532.html</ref>{{cquote|His efforts are typical of a commissioner who has always seemed eager to be viewed as some kind of modern-day plantation overseer, treating NBA men as if they were his boys. ... His moves are intended to do little more than show how he's the one keeping the hired hands in their place.}}

In a Rolling Stone article dated January 20, 2015, Gumbel said "There are a few things I hate more than the NRA. I mean truly. I think they're pigs. I think they don't care about human life. I think they are a curse upon the American landscape. So we got that on the record." <ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/real-talk-bryant-gumbel-on-the-nfl-the-ncaa-and-the-nra-20150120</ref>

====''The Weather Man''====
Gumbel made a cameo appearance alongside [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael Caine]] in ''[[The Weather Man]]'', a [[2005 in film|film]] directed by [[Gore Verbinski]]. In the film, Gumbel co-hosts a morning show entitled ''Hello America'' for which Cage's character, a depressed weatherman, auditions.

====''Seinfeld''====
Gumbel made a cameo appearance on the NBC sitcom "Seinfeld" during which he interviewed Jerry Seinfeld on the Today Show while Jerry was wearing the puffy pirate shirt.

====The NFL Network====
{{Main|Run to the Playoffs}}
In April 2006, [[NFL Network|the NFL Network]] announced that Gumbel, along with [[Cris Collinsworth]] and [[Dick Vermeil]], would comment on its new package of NFL games. Unlike his brother Greg, Bryant had never called [[play-by-play]]<ref>[http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/sports/16340143.htm "Gumbel's move to play-by-play was a bad call"]</ref><ref>[http://sportsmediawatch.blogspot.com/2009/12/decade-in-review-10-worst%20-personnel.html Sports Media Watch presents the ten worst personnel moves of the 2000s. #6: Bryant Gumbel calls NFL games (2006–08, NFL Network)]</ref> for live sporting events in his career. Before his first game commentary for the network, Gumbel's status was brought into question after he stirred up controversy in his closing remarks on his HBO program on August 15, 2006, in which he criticized [[NFL Players Association]] head [[Gene Upshaw]] and outgoing [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]]. Gumbel would later reconcile with the NFL and retained his play-by-play job with the NFL Network.<ref>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14701011/ Gumbel, NFL reconcile after ‘leash’ comment – NFL – MSNBC.com]</ref> On December 29, 2007, Gumbel had a reunion of sorts as he called the [[2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game|Patriots-Giants game]] on the NFL Network, CBS, and NBC. This is the first 3-network simulcast NFL game and coincidentally Gumbel has worked for all three networks during his career. He also had a strong affiliation with NFL films.

Gumbel was fired as play-by-play announcer in April 2008, prior to the [[2008 NFL season]]. He would be replaced on the NFL Network telecasts by [[Bob Papa]].

==Personal life==
Gumbel raised two children with his wife June in semi-rural [[Waccabuc]], north of New York City. In 2001, he divorced her to marry Hilary Quinlan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nypost.com/2001/08/22/bryant-gumbels-divorce-settlement-she-got-the-cash/ | title=Bryant Gumbel's Divorce Settlement: She Got the Cash | work=[[The New York Post]] | date=22 August 2001 | accessdate=5 June 2014 | author=Duleavy, Steve}}</ref> In October 2009, Gumbel had surgery to remove a malignant tumor near one of his lungs.
