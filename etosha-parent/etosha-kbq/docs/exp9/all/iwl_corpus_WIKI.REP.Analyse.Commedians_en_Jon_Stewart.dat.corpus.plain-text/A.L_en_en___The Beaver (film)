'''''The Beaver''''' is a 2011 [[dramedy]] film directed by and starring [[Jodie Foster]], written by [[Kyle Killen]], and starring [[Mel Gibson]], [[Anton Yelchin]], and [[Jennifer Lawrence]]. This is Gibson and Foster's first film together since 1994's ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]''. This is [[Summit Entertainment]]'s only film to have [[Entertainment One]] not distribute it within the UK.

==Plot==
Walter Black ([[Mel Gibson]]) is a depressed CEO of Jerry Co., a toy company nearing bankruptcy. He is kicked out by his wife ([[Jodie Foster]]), to the relief of their elder son Porter ([[Anton Yelchin]]). Walter moves into a hotel. After unsuccessful suicide attempts, he develops an alternate personality represented by a beaver hand [[puppet]] found in the trash. He wears the puppet constantly, communicating solely by speaking as the beaver, helping him to recover. He reestablishes a bond with his younger son Henry and then with his wife, although not with his elder son, Porter. He also becomes successful again at work by creating a line of Mr. Beaver Building Kits for kids.

Porter, who gets paid to write papers for schoolmates, is asked by Norah ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) to write her graduation speech. He gets emotionally attached to Norah but his father's actions with the beaver puppet embarrass him.

Walter's wife moves out of the house with the children, because he lied to her about the puppet being part of a treatment plan monitored by his psychiatrist. She feels she can no longer communicate with her husband and that he is suffering from a [[dissociative identity disorder]], with the beaver taking him over.

Part of Walter's personality realizes what he has put his family through and wants to get rid of the beaver to get back together with his family, but the beaver resists. Walter finally takes the puppet out of his life by cutting off his arm at the elbow. He gets a prosthetic hand and is placed in a psychiatric hospital.

Norah reconnects with Porter. She starts the speech he wrote, but stops and admits publicly that she did not write it herself. She switches to explain the value of truth and her trauma caused by her brother's death some years ago.  Porter realizes the value of his father and reunites with him.

Walter Black becomes himself again and returns to a normal life.

Before its release, much of the coverage focussed on the unavoidable association between the protagonist's issues and Mel Gibson's own well-publicized personal and legal problems, including a conviction of battery of his ex-girlfriend in March.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/movies/jodie-foster-talks-about-the-beaver-and-mel-gibson.html</ref>  Wrote Time Magazine: "''The Beaver'' is a somber, sad domestic drama featuring an alcoholic in acute crisis.  Sound familiar, almost like a documentary? It’s hard to separate Gibson’s true-life story from what’s happening onscreen."<ref>http://entertainment.time.com/2011/05/04/the-beaver-are-we-ready-to-forgive-mel-gibson/</ref> While critics were impressed by the actor's performance, audiences seemed to stay away due to the "ick factor" of seeing Gibson on screen.<ref>http://www.ew.com/article/2011/05/10/beaver-mel-gibson-box-office</ref>

==Critical reception==
The Beaver received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 61% based on reviews from 171 critics and reports a rating average of 6.1 out of 10. It reported the consensus, "Jodie Foster's visual instincts and Mel Gibson's all-in performance sell this earnest, straightforward movie."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_beaver_2010/ | title=The Beaver Movie Reviews | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate= May 17, 2011 }}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 59 based on 32 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-beaver | title=The Beaver Reviews | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate= May 17, 2011 }}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 1/2 (out of a possible 4) star rating, saying, "''The Beaver'' is almost successful, despite the premise of its screenplay, which I was simply unable to accept."<ref>{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110504/REVIEWS/110509994 | title=The Beaver | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date= May 4, 2011 }}</ref>
