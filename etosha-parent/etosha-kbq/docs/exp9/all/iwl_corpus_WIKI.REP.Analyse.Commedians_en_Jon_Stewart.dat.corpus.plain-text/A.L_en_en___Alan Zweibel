'''Alan Zweibel''' (born May 20, 1950) is an American producer and writer who has worked on such productions as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', PBS' ''[[Great Performances]]'', and ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]''.

==Early life==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Brooklyn]], Zweibel grew up in the New York City suburbs of [[Wantagh, New York|Wantagh]] and [[Woodmere, New York|Woodmere]] on [[Long Island]].<ref name="NYT"/> He graduated from [[George W. Hewlett High School]] in 1968 and The [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] in 1972.<ref>McGee, Celia. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E7DC1430F93AA35750C0A961958260 "How to Mourn a Friend? One Way Is With a Play"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 9, 1997. Accessed May 21, 2008. "Mr. Zweibel harbored secret ambitions to write as far back as his days as ''a jock'' at Hewlett High School on Long Island. After graduation from the University of Buffalo...."</ref>

Upon graduation from college, Zweibel started writing for stand-up comedians who paid him seven dollars a joke.  He later compiled over 1,100 of them into a portfolio which he showed to producer Lorne Michaels who then hired Zweibel to be one of the original writers of a new show called ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Television==
During his five years at ''SNL'' (1975–1980), Zweibel wrote many memorable sketches including the ''Samurai'' for [[John Belushi]], and helped to create the characters of [[Roseanne Roseannadanna]] and [[Emily Litella]], both played by [[Gilda Radner]].  In fact, on Weekend Update, Radner read letters supposedly from Richard Feder of Fort Lee, New Jersey who in real life was Zweibel's brother-in-law and did live in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk0NSZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NjcyMDc2MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTM=  Once again, Ft.

Zweibel's close friendship and collaboration with Gilda Radner extended beyond their tenure at ''Saturday Night Live'' – as her last television appearance was on an episode of ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' which Zweibel co-created and produced. After Radner's death from ovarian cancer, Zweibel wrote a bestselling book about their relationship titled [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1557832765 ''Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner – a Sort of Love Story''] which he later adapted into an off-Broadway play.

Zweibel has won multiple Emmy, Writers Guild of America, and TV Critics awards for his work in television which also includes ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' and an episode of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]''.

==Publishing, Theater and Film==
In addition to ''Bunny Bunny'', Zweibel's other books include [http://www.amazon.com/dp/081297283X ''The Other Shulman''] – a novel that won the 2006 [[Thurber Prize for American Humor]].  His popular children's book, [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RAR19E ''Our Tree Named Steve,''] was a Scholastic Book Club selection that has been translated into eleven languages, and his young adult novel, [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679748245 ''North,''] was made into a movie directed by [[Rob Reiner]].  A collection of short stories and essays, [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345500865 ''Clothing Optional,''] was published by Villard in 2008.

In 2011 Price World Publishing dusted off some stories Zweibel had written years ago into the eBook "[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G828TC/ From the Bottom Drawer of: Alan Zweibel]".  Zweibel and [[Dave Barry]] collaborated to write the novel [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399158693/ Lunatics] to be released in January 2012.  [[Universal Pictures]] acquired 'Lunatics' to produce as a film that will star [[Steve Carell]].<ref>http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/universal-pictures-acquires-novel-lunatics-as-star-vehicle-for-steve-carell/</ref>

His humor has appeared in such diverse publications as ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The New York Times]] Op-Ed Page,'' ''The Huffington Post,'' and ''[[Mad Magazine]]''.

In the theater, Zweibel's work has appeared both on and off Broadway.  On Broadway, he co-wrote ''Fame Becomes Me'' with [[Martin Short]] and collaborated with [[Billy Crystal]] on the Tony Award-winning production of ''[[700 Sundays]]''.  Zweibel's off-Broadway shows include ''Between Cars, Comic Dialogue, Bunny Bunny,'' and ''Happy.''

His film credits include ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', ''The Story of Us,'' and ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]'' which so infuriated film critic [[Roger Ebert]] that he penned a now-famous review, one line of which later served as the title of Ebert's book, ''I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie''; Zweibel carries a clipping of the review in his wallet and reads it at public appearances to the delight of audiences.<ref>Zweibel appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]],'' November 14, 2008</ref>

==Personal==
In 2009, Zweibel was awarded an honorary PhD. by the State University of New York and the following year, he was awarded the Ian McLellan Hunter Lifetime Achievement Award by the Writers Guild of America, East.

Zweibel and his wife Robin Blankman, who met while they were both working on ''Saturday Night Live'', live in Short Hills, New Jersey.  They have three children, Adam, Lindsay and Sari and two grandchildren Zachary and Alexis.
