'''''The Record''''' (colloquially called '''''The Bergen Record''''' or '''''The Record of Hackensack'''''<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/biography/1995-Commentary 1995 Pulitzer Prize Winners for Commentary]</ref>) is a newspaper in [[northern New Jersey]], United States.  It primarily serves [[Bergen County]], though it also covers [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]] and [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]] counties as well.  It has the second largest circulation of New Jersey's daily [[newspaper]]s, behind ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''.<ref name=circulation/> Founded in 1895 and owned by the Borg family since 1930, it is the flagship publication of the [[North Jersey Media Group]]. [[Stephen A. Borg]] is the publisher of ''The Record''.  The paper is edited by [[Martin Gottlieb]].

For years, ''The Record'' had its primary offices in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] with a bureau in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]]. Following the purchase of the competing ''[[Herald News]]'' of [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], both papers began centralizing operations in what is now [[Woodland Park, New Jersey|Woodland Park]], where ''The Record'' is currently located. 
==History==
In 1930 John Borg, a Wall Street financier, bought ''The Record.''<ref name="Sloat2013">{{cite book|last=Sloat|first=Warren|title=The Press and the Suburbs: The Daily Newspapers of New Jersey|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=coNrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA40|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=2013-11|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412851930|pages=40–}}</ref>

From 1952 to 1963 the circulation of ''The Record'' doubled and its coverage changed from local to regional.<ref name="Aron1969"/>   It was one of the papers whose editorial position was in favor of the Metropolitan Regional Council (MRC)<ref name="Aron1969">{{cite book|last=Aron|first=Joan B.|title=The Quest for Regional Cooperation: A Study of the New York Metropolitan Regional Council|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IJygh3TVU0MC&pg=PA67|accessdate=16 January 2014|year=1969|publisher=University of California Press|pages=67–}}</ref>

In 1974, writers in the area voted ''The Record'' first in the categories of writing, editing and local coverage.<ref name="Sloat2013"/> It provided different local news coverage for various areas in its distribution range.<ref name="Sloat2013"/>

In 1983, the paper had a daily circulation of just over 149,000 with its readership described as "upscale".<ref name="Sloat2013">{{cite book|last=Sloat|first=Warren|title=The Press and the Suburbs: The Daily Newspapers of New Jersey|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=coNrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA40|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=2013-11|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412851930|pages=40–}}</ref>

On September 12, 1988, its afternoon publication and delivery changed to early morning.  When combined with more centralized distribution requiring carriers to have automobiles, many "youth carriers" ([[Newspaper delivery|paperboys]]) were put out of work.<ref name=Weber-Leaf-2015-04-16>{{cite news|last1=Weber-Leaf|first1=Pamela|title=Carrying history: Paperboys (and girls) of The Record|url=http://www.bergencounty.com/history-and-trivia/carrying-history-paperboys-and-girls-of-the-record-1.1308694|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=(201) Magazine|publisher=BergenCounty.com}}</ref>

==Format and style==
The paper's approach to coverage made it "read like a magazine".<ref name="Sloat2013"/> Rather than a focus on breaking news on its front page, it featured "The Patch", a thematic topic or investigative report.<ref name="Sloat2013"/>

==Raising the Flag at Ground Zero==

In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], a photographer for ''The Record'', [[Thomas E. Franklin]], took a photograph of three firefighters raising an [[American flag]] over the rubble of what had been the World Trade Center.
