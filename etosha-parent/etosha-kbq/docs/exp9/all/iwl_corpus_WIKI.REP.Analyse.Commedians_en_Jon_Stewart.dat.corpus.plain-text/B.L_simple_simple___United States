The '''United States of America''' ('''USA'''), commonly referred to as the '''United States''' ('''US'''), or '''America '''is a [[country]] in [[North&nbsp;America]]. It is made up of 50 [[U.S. State|states]], a [[federal district]], and five [[territory|territories]]. It is one of the world's [[superpower]]s. It is famous for its [[influence]] over [[finance]], [[trade]], [[culture]], [[military]], [[politics]], and [[technology]].

==History==
{{main|History of the United States}}

==Government ==
The United States is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[republic]]. The [[:wikt:federal|federal]] [[:wikt:government|government]] is set up by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. There are three [[branch]]es of government. They are the ''[[executive branch]]'', the ''[[legislative branch]]'', and the ''[[judicial branch]]''. State governments work much like the federal government. 

=== Executive branch ===
The [[executive branch]] is the part of the government that enforces the law.  Members of the [[U.S. Electoral College]] elect a [[President of the United States|president]] who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the [[armed forces]]. The president may [[veto]] a bill that the Congress has passed, so it doesn't become a law. The President may also make "executive orders" to ensure that people follow the law. Two of the most famous executive orders were President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s order to send soldiers to allow the [[Little Rock Nine]] into a school. 

The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day [[business]] of government. For example, [[Department of Commerce]] makes rules about trade and business.  The president chooses the heads of these departments, and also nominates federal judges.  However, the Senate, part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses. The president may serve two 4-year terms.

=== Legislative branch ===
[[File:USCapitol.jpg|thumb|right|The west side of the [[United States Capitol]], which is home to the [[United States Congress]]]]
The [[legislative branch]] makes laws. The legislative branch is called the [[United States Congress]]. Congress is divided into two "houses".

One house is the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].  The Representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state.  The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there.  Representatives serve two-year terms. The total number of representatives today is 435. The leader of the House of Representatives is the [[Speaker of the House]], who would become president if the president and [[vice president]] were unable to serve.

The other house is the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators. Before the President makes [[treaty|treaties]] or appoints [[official]]s, the Senate must approve them. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate.  In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator is selected to serve as president pro tempore, or [[wikt:temporary|temporary]] president, of the Senate.

Representatives and senators [[proposal|propose]] laws, called "[[bill (law)|bill]]s", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group of members of that house, known as a [[committees of the United States Senate|committee]], which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or [[veto]] it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds [[majority]], the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president.

Under the American system of [[federalism]], Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national [[emergency|emergencies]], to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique.

===Judicial branch===
The [[Judicial Branch]] is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution, the law is said to be "struck down" and is no longer a [[validity|valid]] law. The Supreme Court is made up of nine [[judge]]s, called [[justice]]s, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]], heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or [[resignation|resigns]] (quits in the middle of his or her term). When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else.

Famous court cases such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the [[United States Constitution]] and has the power to strike down any law that [[conflict]]s with it.<ref>http://www.landmarkcases.org/marbury/home.html</ref>

== Politics ==
{{See also|States of the United States|Politics of the United States}}
[[File:Political System of the United States.svg|thumb|300px|The political system of the United States]]
The United States of America consists of [[States of the United States|50 states]], 5 territories and 1 district ([[Washington D.C]].). States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is usually about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution. Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws.

The federal and most state governments are dominated by two [[Political party|political parties]]: the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] and the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]. There are also many smaller parties; the largest of these are the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]. People give money to political [[campaign]]s that they like, and try to persuade politicians to help them. This is called [[lobbying]]. All Americans are allowed to lobby the government, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and want rules to be made to change it.

Since 2009, the president is a Democrat, so Democrats have slightly more power in the federal government. However, there are still many powerful Republicans who can try to stop the Democrats from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country. Also, the Democrats do not always agree with each other on what to do. And if enough people decide to vote against Democrats in the next election, then they will lose power. In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want. All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done. They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes.

The USA's large cultural, economic, and military influence has made the [[foreign policy of the United States]], or relations with other countries, an especially important topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries.

[[File:GeorgeWashington.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|first President]].]]

== Land ==
The country grew from East to West. It conquered and bought lands.

The states are divided into [[county|counties]]. Two states do not use the word "county". Louisiana uses the word "[[parish]]". Alaska uses the word "[[borough]]".

The United States also consists of several other lands that are not states. Most of these are [[colony|colonial]] [[territory|territories]], and are not a part of the Mainland U.S. Some examples are:
* [[Puerto Rico]]
* [[American Samoa]]
* [[Guam]]
* [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]
* [[Northern Mariana Islands]]

The United States also includes one federal district that was split from a state:
* [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital.

The largest city is [[New York City|New York]]. Other major US cities include [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Seattle]], [[Miami]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Denver]], [[St. Louis]], [[Dallas]], and [[Pittsburgh]].

The [[Philippines]] ([[island]]s) was once a [[possession]] of the United States. [[Palau]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], and other [[Pacific Islands|Pacific island]] nations were once governed by the United States as a United Nations "Trust Territory", but are now [[independence|independent]].

The U.S. military has [[Military base|bases]] in many countries.
The U.S. Naval base at [[Guantanamo Bay]] was rented from [[Cuba]], even after that country had a [[Communist]] revolution.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United States}}
The United States is the third biggest country in the world. Only [[Russia]] and [[Canada]] are bigger. Its [[geography]] varies a lot and includes:

* [[forest]]s and grass fields on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]]
* the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the east
* the [[Great Plains]] in the middle of the country
* the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River|Missouri]] river in the middle of the country
* the [[Rocky Mountains]] west of the [[plain]]s
* [[desert]]s and coastal areas west of the Rocky Mountains
* [[forest]]s in the [[Pacific Northwest]]
* [[Arctic]] regions of Alaska
* [[volcano|volcanic]] islands in Hawaii
* a long [[coastline]] with many [[beach]]es
* the [[everglades]] in [[Florida]]  
The [[climate]] varies along with the geography, from [[tropical]] (hot and wet in [[summer]], warm and dry in [[winter]]) in [[Florida]] to [[tundra]] (cold all year) in Alaska. Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters. Some parts of the United States, like parts of California, have a [[Mediterranean climate]].

==Economy==
The United States has a [[capitalist]] [[economy]]. The country has rich [[mineral]] [[Natural resource|resource]]s, with many [[gold]], [[coal]] and [[uranium]] deposits. [[Farming]] makes the country among the top producers of, among others, [[corn]] ([[maize]]), [[wheat]], [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]]. American produces [[automobile|cars]], [[airplanes]] and [[electronics]]. About 3/4 of Americans work in the [[service industry]].

The United States of America has people of many different [[race (sociology)|race]] and [[ethnic group|ethnic]] backgrounds. 80% of the people in the United States [[:wikt:descend|descend]] from [[Europe]]an [[immigration|immigrants]]. Many people are descended from [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Africa]], and [[Italy]].<ref>http://www.geolytics.com/?gclid=CK7Nw9bgpJYCFRJ4xgod32jc5g</ref>  13% of the people in the United States are [[African-American]]. Most of them descend from the [[slave trade|African slaves that were brought to America]]. [[Asian]]-Americans make up only 5% of the population in America but make up a bigger portion in the west coast. For example in [[California]], Asian-Americans make up 13% of the population of that state. [[Hispanic]]-Americans or people of Latin origins make up 15% of the nation. The original peoples, called [[Native American]] or ''American Indian''s and [[Inuit]] ([[Eskimo]]s) are a very small group.

11% of the people in the United States are foreign born. 18% speak a language other than English at home. For people 25 and older, 80% are [[high school]] [[graduation|graduates]] while 25% have a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.

The 2000 Census counted self-reported [[ancestor|ancestry]]. It identified 43 million German-Americans, 30.5 million Irish-Americans, 24.9 million African-Americans, 24.5 million English-Americans, and 18.4 million Mexican-Americans.

=== Money ===
The [[social]] [[structure]] of the United States has a big range. This means that some Americans are much, much richer than others. The [[average]] ([[median]]) [[income]] for an American was $37,000 a year in 2002. However, the [[wealthy|richest]] 1% of Americans have as much money as the [[poor]]est 90%. 51% of all households have access to a [[computer]] and 41% had access to the [[Internet]] in 2000, a figure which had grown to 75% in 2004. Also, 67.9% of American families owned their homes in 2002.  There are 200 million cars in the United States, two for every three Americans. The debt has grown to over $16,000,000,000,000.<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/04/who-do-owe-most-that-16-trillion-to-hint-it-isnt-china/</ref>

=== Religion ===
[[Native American mythology|Native American religion]]s included various [[animism|animistic]] [[practice]]s, including [[reverence]] for [[nature]] and [[spirits]]. There are many different [[religion]]s in the U.S. [[Statistics|Statistically]], the largest religion is [[Christianity]], including groups such as [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Mormonism]]. Other religions include [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Wicca]], [[Druidry]], [[Baha'i]], [[Raelism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Jainism]].<ref>Media, Minorities, and Meaning: A Critical Introduction - Page 88, Debra L. Merskin - 2010</ref> Religions which were founded within the United States include [[Eckankar]], [[Satanism]] and [[Scientology]].

The United States is one of the most [[religious]] countries in the [[Western World]], and most Americans believe in [[God]]. The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down. 86.2% called themselves Christian in 1990 and 78.4% said this in 2007. The others include Judaism (1.7%), Islam (0.8%), [[Buddhism]] (0.7%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). Those who have no religion are at 16.1%. There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a religious body of that religion.<ref>http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/affiliations-all-traditions.pdf</ref>

Doubts about the existence of a God, gods or goddesses are higher among young people. Among the non-religious population of the U.S., there are [[deist]]s, [[humanist]]s, [[Ignosticism|ignotic]], [[atheist]]s, and [[agnostic]]s.<ref>Merica, Dan (2012-06-12).

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has increased in usage in certain sectors of society, due to a flow of immigrants—especially from Mexico and Cuba. French is also a main language in parts of Louisiana because France once owned the area as a colony.

==Culture==
American [[popular culture]] goes out to many places in the world. It has a large [[influence]] on most of the world, especially the [[Western hemisphere|Western]] world. American [[music]] is heard all over the world, and American movies and [[television]] shows can be seen in most countries.

===Flag===
