'''Dr. Stephen T.

Colbert first appeared as a correspondent on [[Comedy Central]]'s news parody series ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in 1997 and remained a regular contributor until 2005, when he left to host ''The Colbert Report'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] show satirizing personality-driven political pundit programs. He has also been featured in a number of other public performances, most notably at the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]], and as the author of the books ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'', ''[[I Am a Pole (And So Can You!)]]'', and ''[[America Again: Re-Becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't]]''.

On April 23, 2014, the character appeared on ''The Daily Show'' to announce that he has clearly "won television" and will be ending ''The Colbert Report'' because he has met his goal. This came after the real Colbert announced he will not be using the character when he replaces [[David Letterman]] as the host of ''[[Late Show (CBS TV series)|Late Show]]'' on [[CBS]] in 2015.<ref name="LateShow" /> The [[The final episode of The Colbert Report|final episode]] of ''The Colbert Report'' aired on December 18, 2014; the character later made his final appearance as a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' episode "Chapter 27".

Colbert's performance attracted widespread critical attention and acclaim, with a reviewer writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine calling it "one of the greatest sustained performances in pop culture, TV or otherwise."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3641534/colbert-report-final-episode-review/|agency=TIME|title=Review: The Colbert Report Is Dead.

== Development and inspirations ==

=== ''The Dana Carvey Show'' ===
Colbert's earliest mainstream exposure came in the [[prime time]] [[sketch comedy]] program ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]''. While only lasting seven episodes in early 1996, it provided Colbert with roles that would help forge his future onscreen persona. This was largely due to its format of delivering sketch performances directly to the camera. Although they did not air, several sketches inspired by ''[[The Onion]]'' also had Colbert playing a [[deadpan]] anchor delivering the news.<ref>Heisler, Steve [http://www.avclub.com/articles/dana-carvey-and-robert-smigel,29184/ Interview - Dana Carvey and Robert Smigel] [[AV Club]] (June 15, 2009). Retrieved on 5-09-10.</ref> In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' regarding ''The Dana Carvey Show'', Colbert noted, "If you have an opportunity to give it right to the audience, there’s a special connection that you make by looking at the camera."

Upon the show's cancellation, Colbert was cast for ''[[The Daily Show]]'' by co-creator [[Madeleine Smithberg]]. This was thanks to his performance as a nauseated waiter on ''The Dana Carvey Show''.<ref>Dave, Itzkoff [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/arts/television/10itzk.html?_r=1 Comedy Ahead of Its Time (if That Time Ever Comes)] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (May 7, 2009). Retrieved on 5-09-10.</ref>

=== ''The Daily Show'' ===
{{main|The Daily Show}}

Colbert appeared as a [[correspondent]] on ''The Daily Show'' between 1997 and 2005. During this time, the comedian developed the character that would later form the basis for his ''Colbert Report'' persona, one that its creator calls a "fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool".<ref name="IGN" /> Colbert frequently cites [[Stone Phillips]] — whom he describes as having "the greatest neck in [[journalism]]" — as a source of inspiration for the character, as well as [[Geraldo Rivera]], "because he's got this great sense of mission... He just thinks he's gonna change the world with this report."<ref>{{cite web|author= Berkowitz, Elana; Schiller, Amy|url = http://campusprogress.org/features/375/five-minutes-with-stephen-colbert|title= Five Minutes With Stephen Colbert|publisher= Campus Progress|accessdate= August 14, 2007}}</ref> As a correspondent, Colbert was regularly pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects or host [[Jon Stewart]] in scripted exchanges which typically revealed the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he was discussing.<ref name="Steinberg" /> Other ''Daily Show'' correspondents have since adopted a similar style; former correspondent [[Rob Corddry]] recalls that when he and [[Ed Helms]] first joined the show's cast in 2002, they "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".<ref>[[Rob Corddry|Corddry, Rob]].

Retrieved on October 28, 2007.</ref>

=== ''The Colbert Report'' ===
{{main|The Colbert Report}}

In 2005, Colbert left ''The Daily Show'' to host a spin-off series entitled ''The Colbert Report'', a parody of personality-driven political pundit programs such as [[Fox News]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined over the course of the show, complete with a fictitious [[backstory]] that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.

The character Colbert portrays in ''Report'' originated as an amplification of his self-important ''Daily Show'' correspondent. As they developed the character and the show Colbert and his staff began to look at some more specific models.<ref name="Gross">Colbert, Stephen. Interview with [[Terry Gross]] (October 9, 2007).

The nightly in-character guest interviews were initially of concern to Colbert, who worried his character's belligerent nature would be off-putting to guests. However, since the show's debut, he says he has found he is able to "slide the intensity" of his behavior depending on his interviewee's ability to respond to his aggressive approach. Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his favorite part of the show, because it allows him to improvise.<ref>Colbert, Stephen (December 8, 2006). [http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/93 A conversation with comedian Stephen Colbert]. ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]''.</ref> Colbert advises his guests to disabuse the character of his ignorance. "Don't let me get away with anything. Don't try to play my game. Be real. Be passionate. Hold your ideas. Give me resistance. Give me traction I can work against."<ref name="Harvard" />

=== Books ===

Colbert is the central character in the 2007 book ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. Co-written with [[Paul Dinello]] and the writers of ''The Colbert Report'', ''I Am America'' delves into what the character considers to be the most pressing issues facing America. The book takes influence from the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as O'Reilly's ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' (2000) and Hannity's ''[[Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism|Deliver Us From Evil]]'' (2004), which Colbert says he "forced" himself to read as a reference. ''I Am America'' is considered a pure extension of the ''Report''; the written medium allowed the writers to employ different styles, such as long-format arguments, that they could not have used on television. "You can actually spend 20 pages talking about religion whereas in the show, two pages is about as long as we hold any one idea", Colbert explains. In doing this, the writers "discovered things that [the character] cared about that... they didn't know he cared about before".<ref name="meet" />

A character similar to Colbert's ''Daily Show'' persona featured in the 2003 book ''[[Wigfield: The Can Do Town That Just May Not]]'' by Colbert, Paul Dinello and [[Amy Sedaris]]. Russell Hokes, a self-aggrandizing journalist, was voiced by Colbert in both stage performances of the text and the [[audiobook]]. Colbert likens Hokes to his self-important correspondent character, but "more extreme, more self-involved".<ref>Colbert, Stephen (May 13, 2003). ''[[The Leonard Lopate Show]]''. [[WNYC]].</ref>

==Non-fictional elements==
Certain elements of the character are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' as teenagers; and both are practicing [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, [[science fiction]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' story will often show through in the ''Report''. His character has a chocolate portrait of [[Viggo Mortensen]] (who portrayed [[Aragorn]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' films]]) in a place of honor on his shelf; Mortensen briefly reprised the role of Aragorn in the ''Report'''s September 13, 2007 episode.<ref name="IGN">Ken P (August 11, 2003).

Occasionally, Colbert will mention his real-life siblings on the show. In one episode, he placed his brother Ed, a lawyer who advises the International Olympic Committee, "on notice" for refusing to grant the show the rights to air footage of a dispute between two American [[speed skating|speed skaters]].<ref>[[The Colbert Report]], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=1451 Episode 2022], February 22, 2006.</ref> Ed later appeared at the start of the February 22, 2010 edition advising Stephen on how to cover the [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver Winter Olympics]] since his character doesn't have the television rights to the games. Footage from the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]] was used after Stephen was named a special advisor to USA Speedskating. Generally, journalists covering the Olympics don't have access to the venues unless their employer has the rights to Olympic TV coverage, and can't show moving video coverage of any official Olympic event unless they have permission from the rights holder. When his sister [[Elizabeth Colbert Busch]] declared her intention to run for congress, he mentioned the event. Later, when she was nominated to run against [[Mark Sanford]] and the MSNBC show [[Morning Joe]] declared their support for Sanford and mentioned Colbert, he defended his sister's campaign.

In an appearance at [[Harvard University]] in 2006, Colbert revealed that his character's fear of bears was in part inspired by a recurring nightmare he has had, in which a bear is standing between him and his goal.<ref name="Harvard">{{cite web|url= http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5550134133036374310|title= A Conversation With Stephen Colbert|publisher= [[Harvard Institute of Politics]]|date= October 1, 2006|accessdate= August 15, 2007}}</ref> The character's [[phobia]], which was initially referenced in the show's first "ThreatDown" skit, was originally slated to be a fear of [[alligator]]s. By the time the ''Report'' went to air, the alligator story was several weeks old, and the writers chose to use a more recent news item involving a bear in its place.<ref name="meet">Colbert, Stephen (October 16, 2007).

After Colbert received an honorary [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] from [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], the show began listing his name in the ending credits as "Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A." even though using both the [[honorific]] prefix and [[post-nominal letters]] is incorrect. During the show, the character will sometimes refer to the degree and the qualifications he mistakenly believes it bestows upon him.<ref name=doctorate>{{cite web|title=Stephen Colbert Honorary Degree - Knox College|url=http://deptorg.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12687.html|publisher=Knox College|date=June 1, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2009}}</ref>

In May 2007, Colbert was voted the "second most influential person in the world" by a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine online poll. The first spot was taken by [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]], a young [[K-pop|Korean pop]] star with a large following in Asia and the United States. Colbert then declared Rain his "[[Archenemy|arch-nemesis]]" and began mentioning him frequently on the ''Report''. Colbert filmed a satirical music video poking fun at Rain's popular single "How to Avoid the Sun" and referencing several stereotypical [[Korean cuisine|South Korean dishes]] and products. The one-sided feud eventually culminated in Colbert challenging Rain to a competition on air. After telling Colbert "not to quit his day job", Rain appeared in a short segment on the show and competed (and won) a [[Dance Dance Revolution|DDR]] dance-off with Colbert.<ref>{{cite web|author= Colbert, Stephen|url= http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?collectionId=167949|title= Rain Rivalry|publisher= [[Comedy Central]]|date= May 10, 2007|accessdate= March 18, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080718054844/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?collectionId=167949 |archivedate = July 18, 2008 }}</ref> Both have been defeated by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] in recent polls,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?collectionId=167949|title= The 2008 TIME 100 Finalists|publisher= [[Time Magazine]]|date= May 10, 2008|accessdate= March 18, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080718054844/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?collectionId=167949 |archivedate = July 18, 2008}}</ref> though they still continue to be strong contenders.

On June 21, 2007, Colbert broke his left wrist on the set of the ''Report'' while performing his warm-up for the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofactzone.net/2007/07/26/avery-reports-stephen-has-been-injured/|title=The Truth Behind Stephen Colbert's Broken Wrist: Injury on the set of "The Colbert Report"|date= July 26, 2007|accessdate= November 8, 2012}}</ref> This quickly became a regular source of comedy on the show as the self-absorbed character requested his audience send flowers, launched a campaign against [[Hollywood]]'s supposed glorification of "wrist violence", and began a "wrist [[Awareness campaign|awareness]]" campaign with "[[Livestrong wristband|WristStrong]]" [[gel bracelet|silicone bracelets]].<ref>{{cite news|author= Stelter, Brian|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/business/media/27colbert.html|title= 2 Out of 3 Anchors Join Colbert in Wrist Stunt|publisher= The New York Times|date= August 27, 2007|accessdate= December 20, 2007}}</ref> Although his wrist has healed, he continues to wear and promote his "WristStrong" bracelets.

Colbert occasionally makes comments that he would also make were he not in character. In an interview with ''The Buffalo News'', Colbert said "The weird thing about my character, even on the show, is sometimes I say what I mean. It doesn't matter to me that the audience doesn't know when that is."<ref>Pergament, Alan (April 10, 2014).

On June 19, 2013, Colbert came back from an unplanned break where he took several days due to the passing of his mother (Lorna Colbert). He started the show with a tribute to his mother, first with a short biography of her life and followed by an emotional video.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Colbert|first1=Stephen|url=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/yxgnju/remembering-lorna-colbert|website=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/|title=Remembering Lorna Colbert |publisher=Comedy Central|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> Colbert was visibly emotional and at the point of tears throughout the tribute.

Colbert's fictional history is not always rigidly adhered to by the show's writers. The comedian himself says that, "My character's history may not always be perfectly consistent ...

Prior to embarking on a career in journalism, Colbert worked as a carnival [[roustabout]] and a construction worker. During the 1980s, he was the lead singer and guitarist of an [[ABC (band)|ABC]]-like [[New wave music|new wave]] band called "Stephen and the Colberts". The comedian portrays his character's younger self in the band's [[music video]], wearing worn jeans, cowboy boots and a spiky hair style. Their only revealed song to date is entitled "Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)", one of numerous references to an ex-girlfriend (and cousin) whom he continues to [[stalking|stalk]] despite numerous [[restraining order]]s.<ref>[[The Colbert Report]], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=67 Episode 2094], July 26, 2006.</ref> This song has been made available for [[music download|download]] for free in the video game ''[[Rock Band]]''. On the May 14, 2008 episode, Colbert claimed to have been the "[[totalitarian]] ruler of [[Malawi]] from 1982 to 1984". He mentions that his wife's first name is Lorraine.

Colbert later moved into reporting, working in TV news for several stations in [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Occasionally he will show footage of himself as a "young man" (portrayed by Colbert, wearing a false moustache) working as an anchor at a local news station (WPTS) in [[Patterson Springs, North Carolina]], still displaying his trademark outrage over minor municipal issues in the manner of ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' correspondent [[John Stossel]]. In 1997, Colbert was promoted to anchor of the Channel 7 News on WPTS Patterson Springs after [[outing]] the previous anchor, Wayne Colt, for his [[cocaine]] addiction. His ensuing investigative reports into Colt's downfall earned him a local [[Emmy]], and eventually a correspondent position at ''The Daily Show''.<ref name="IAAASCY" /> This corresponds with the year the comedian joined the cast of the show.

Colbert often makes digs at the expense of ''Daily Show'' host [[Jon Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Franklin |first=Nancy|url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/11/28/051128crte_television|title= The Spinoff Zone|publisher= The New Yorker|date= November 28, 2005|accessdate= December 20, 2007}}</ref> He has implied a strained relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian,<ref name="MaureenDowd"/> and suggests that his departure from ''The Daily Show'' occurred under dubious circumstances.

Colbert is described in ''[[America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]'', to which he was a contributor while serving as a 'Daily Show' correspondent, as holding the positions of the [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|Arthur Schlesinger]] Professor of American Studies at Harvard University,<ref>America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction (Warner Books, September 2004) ISBN 0-446-53268-1, p. 39</ref> and of Chief Defender of International War Crimes at the [[International Criminal Court|World Court]] in [[the Hague]].<ref name="America The Book, p. 92">America (The Book), p. 92</ref> The book also states that he is the seven-time recipient of the

== Presidential campaigns ==
=== Colbert '08 ===
{{main|Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008}}

Colbert dropped hints of a potential presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, ''I Am America (And So Can You!)'', which was rumored (invariably by Colbert himself) to be a sign that he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the [[White House]]. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating he had not yet made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.

Colbert confirmed his presidential ambitions on his October 16, 2007 show,<ref>{{cite news|author= Kurtz, Howard|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/16/AR2007101602462.html?nav=hcmodule|title= Primary-Time TV With Colbert the Candidate|publisher= The Washington Post|date= October 17, 2007|accessdate= December 20, 2007}}</ref> stating his intention to run both on the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] platforms, but only as a [[favorite son]] in his native South Carolina. In an interview with [[Larry King]] he revealed that, as his running mate, he would consider [[Mike Huckabee]] (who himself jokingly offered Colbert the vice presidential position<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-colbert-report/stephen-colbert-for-vice-presi-15564.aspx|title= Stephen Colbert for Vice President?}}</ref>).<ref>[[Editor & Publisher]] (October 11, 2007).

Colbert abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina [[primary election|primary]]. On November 1, 2007, it was announced that he would not appear on the Democratic primary ballot either, after being deemed ineligible by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee.<ref>{{cite web|author= Vogel, Kenneth|url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1107/6674.html|title= S.C.

The show went on hiatus immediately after this as a result of the [[2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America Strike]]. When it returned to air on January 7, 2008 without a writing staff, the character justified his absence by stating that he had taken some time off to have "a good cry" about his failed presidential attempt. He said that he had returned to air in celebration of Huckabee's success in the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucus]], something for which he considers himself [[Colbert bump|personally responsible]] as Huckabee has appeared on the ''Report'' on numerous occasions to invite Colbert to be his running mate.<ref>[[The Colbert Report]], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=2919 Episode 4001], January 7, 2008.</ref>

Despite having withdrawn from the presidential race, Colbert continued to be referred to as an active candidate in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Colbert '08 paraphernalia appeared in the artwork of various [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics,<ref name="ColbertforMarvel">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3547.Colbert_for_President|title=Colbert For President|accessdate=June 1, 2008|date=May 31, 2008|work=Marvel.com}}</ref> and Colbert himself teamed up with [[Spider-Man]] in the October 2008 comic ''Amazing Spider-Man #573''.<ref name="Spiderman573" /> On November 5, 2008, Marvel announced that its fictional newspaper ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' was reporting Colbert's victory over both [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news|author= Thill, Scott|url=http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/11/colbert-beats-o.html|title=Colbert Bests Obama, Wins Marvel White House|accessdate=November 6, 2008|date=November 5, 2008|work=Wired}}</ref> Several hours later Marvel released a second ''Daily Bugle'' article correcting its initial reports, stating that while Colbert had won the popular vote Obama had secured more electoral votes, thus winning the presidency.

During the January 12, 2012 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert announced his plans to form an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for his possible candidacy for "[[President of the United States]] of [[South Carolina]]". In the process, he transferred control of the Super PAC to [[Jon Stewart]], renaming it ''The Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC'', since, according to Colbert's lawyer, Trevor Potter, it would definitely be illegal for Colbert and Stewart to coordinate their efforts in super PAC activities. A [[CBS]] news report called Colbert's run "essentially a joke", saying, "The real significance of Colbert's announcement may be the spotlight it puts on super PACs, into which donors can pour unlimited money in order to support or attack candidates, and thus influence election outcomes. Super PACs were made possible by the 2010 "[[Citizens United]]" Supreme Court decision that effectively classified money as speech".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57358732-503544/stephen-colbert-isnt-really-running-for-president/ | work=CBS News | title=Stephen Colbert isn't really running for president}}</ref>

Colbert's timing was too late for his name to be added the South Carolina primary ballot, and South Carolina law would not allow for [[write-in]] candidates.  Polling showed that 21% of the potential Republican primary electorate reported they would be "more likely" to vote for former candidate [[Herman Cain]], who remained on the ballot, if that vote served as encouragement for Colbert.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://maristpoll.marist.edu/119-colbert/ |title=18% in South Carolina Kinda Somewhat Likely to Back Colbert &#124; Home of the Marist Poll: Pebbles and Pundits |publisher=Maristpoll.marist.edu |date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref> Herman Cain received 6,338 votes in the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2012|South Carolina Republican Primary]], which was more than all the other withdrawn candidates received combined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enr-scvotes.org/SC/36831/64075/en/summary.html |title=South Carolina Election Division, Results for the 2012 Republican Presidential Primary |publisher=Enr-scvotes.org |date=January 22, 2012 |accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref> On the next episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' broadcast on January 23, 2012, Colbert boasted about passing the 1% threshold and for Cain receiving many more votes in South Carolina than in [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012|New Hampshire]].

Since the election of [[Barack Obama]], Colbert continues his right-wing views, but claims he will "support our new President as long as [he] remains popular". Colbert emphasizes that his character is genuinely well-meaning and wants to do the right thing, but does not have the tools to achieve it "because he has no curiosity, he doesn't like to read and he won't listen to anybody except the voices in his head".<ref>{{cite news|last= Colbert |first=Stephen|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0710/14/lkl.01.html|title= Larry King Live: Interview with Stephen Colbert|publisher= CNN|date= October 14, 2007|accessdate= December 20, 2007}}</ref>

[[Image:Colbert report.jpg|thumb|left|The "Eagle's Nest", with its many references to Colbert, reflects the character's self-aggrandizing style.]]

Colbert is deeply self-centered and takes everything personally, a trait which is reflected in his discussion of the news and current events. According to the comedian, "There's nothing too large that doesn't involve him. Every news story is really about him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds with well-known figures such as [[The Decemberists]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Tony Bennett]], and [[Don Rickles]] (the latter three of whom beat out Colbert for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program|Best Individual in a Variety or Music Program]] at the [[Emmys]]). The comedian equates these feuds with Bill O'Reilly's [[culture war]]s.<ref name="Gross" />

Central to Colbert's personality is his rigid belief that "what I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true",<ref name="avclub" /> regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the ''Report'''s first [[Wørd]] segment, using the term "[[truthiness]]" as he explained what he perceives to be the difference between "those who think with their head and those who ''know'' with their ''heart''".<ref>The Colbert Report, [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=662 Episode 1001], October 17, 2005.</ref> He has further gone on to ascribe "truthiness" to other institutions including [[Wikipedia]], which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people want something to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at [[global warming]], Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the [[box office]] success of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', a sign that "the [[free market]] has spoken".

Colbert describes himself as [[Race-blind|racially color-blind]] and unable to visually identify a person's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]],<ref>Pastorek, Whitney (2007).

People tell me I'm white, and I believe them, because I own a lot of [[Jimmy Buffett]] albums."<ref>[[The Colbert Report]], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=438 Episode 2138], November 2, 2006.</ref> His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines.<ref>Other punch lines include: [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=1157 ...because I have my own late night talk show], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=1403 ...because I can’t say the "N" word], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=1017 ...because I think Barack Obama is black], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=544 ...because I shop at Eddie Bauer], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=566 ...because I belong to an all-white country club]</ref> For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, "When I say I don't see race, I mean I don't see [[Black people]]. But I can spot a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] at a hundred paces."<ref name="IAAASCY" /> Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts that he has a large number of [[Tokenism|token]] minority friends (including Jon Stewart as "[his] [[Jew]]ish friend" and [[Oprah Winfrey]] as "[his] [[African American|black]] friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times [[sexist]] behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.

The comedian has said that he likes playing weak characters, and particularly revealing weaknesses in high status figures.<ref>Plume, Ken (August 11, 2006). [http://www.tibbysbowl.com/bowl/2009/01/05/stephen-colbert-interview/ Interview: Stephen Colbert]. ''Tibby's Bowl''. Retrieved on December 20, 2007.</ref> During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated [[waterboarding]], only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped.<ref>[[The Colbert Report]], [http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=476 Episode 2143], November 13, 2006.</ref> In another episode, he criticizes ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' cohost [[Matt Lauer]] for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that [[Katie Couric]] has left the show. These [[status shift]]s occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.<ref name="Harvard" />
