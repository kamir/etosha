The movie premiered at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and centers around two talented brothers who take very diverse paths in life, one going on to become a doctor whilst the other sibling (Franco) experiences unemployment and uses drugs.

In February 2014, Franco wrote an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in support of the [[metamodernism|metamodernist]] performance art of [[Shia LaBeouf]], describing LaBeouf's project as one "in which a young man in a very public profession tries to reclaim his public persona."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/21/james-franco-shia-labeouf-new-york-times | title=James Franco supports Shia LaBeouf in New York Times piece | newspaper=The Guardian | date=21 January 2014 | accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/opinion/james-franco-on-shia-labeoufs-recent-antics.html | title=Why Actors Act Out | newspaper=New York Times | date=19 January 2014 | accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>

In April 2014, the literary publisher [[Graywolf Press]] issued Franco's first collection of poetry, ''Directing Herbert White''. The title alludes to a poem (made by Franco into a 2010 short film) by [[Frank Bidart]], who has served as friend and mentor to Franco.<ref name=Graywolf>{{cite web|publisher=[[Graywolf Press]]|title=Directing Herbert White|url=https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/directing-herbert-white|first=James|last=Franco|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}</ref>

==In the media==
Viewed as a [[sex symbol]], Franco was named the Sexiest Man Living in 2009 by [[Salon.com]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Hepola|title=Sexiest Man Living 2009 |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/sexiest_man_living_2009/2009/11/19/james_franco/index.html|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> There has often been frequent media coverage of Franco, particularly regarding his interest in going to colleges. In addition to that, Franco has also claimed to have been strongly misquoted by reports in the media<ref name="playboy"/> and news outlets reporting erroneous information about him.<ref>''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]'' [[Public Broadcasting System]] April 19, 2011.</ref> This led to the actor being parodied in an episode of ''SNL''{{'}}s Weekend Update segment, which an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer deemed "clever".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/02/06/saturday-night-live-dana-carvey-linkin-park/ |title='Saturday Night Live' recap: Dana Carvey brought his old characters, some old friends, and Justin Bieber |newspaper=Entrainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> In a 2011 interview, he stated:

<blockquote>I’ve been perceived as this guy yelling, "Hey, look at me. I want attention." I’m not going to school to get articles written about me. I’m just going to school. But the fact that I’m going to school or that someone takes a picture of me sleeping is like, "We’re gonna jump on that and criticize him for his antics." What antics? I write. I make movies. I’m going to school. I hosted the Oscars. I take these projects seriously.<ref name="playboy"/></blockquote>

Franco has deliberately garnered a reputation for publishing "[[selfie]]s" (self-shot photos of oneself, alone or with others) and wrote an explanatory article for the ''New York Times'' in December 2013. Franco writes:

<blockquote>
But a well-stocked collection of selfies seems to get attention. And attention seems to be the name of the game when it comes to social networking. In this age of too much information at a click of a button, the power to attract viewers amid the sea of things to read and watch is power indeed. It’s what the movie studios want for their products, it’s what professional writers want for their work, it’s what newspapers want — hell, it’s what everyone wants: attention. Attention is power.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Franco Explains the Art of Selfies: 'Attention Is Power'|url=http://mashable.com/2013/12/26/james-franco-seflies-new-york-times-instagram/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=28 December 2013|author=Brian Anthony Hernandez|date=27 December 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

In April 2012, ''Shalom Life'' ranked Franco and his brother, Dave, together as number two on its list of 50 talented and attractive Jewish men.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.shalomlife.com/culture/17032/top-50-hottest-jewish-men-10-1/ |title=Top 50 Hottest Jewish Men (10-1) - Page1 |newspaper=Shalom Life |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref> In 2013, Franco was featured as the cover model and featured focus in the men's magazine ''Man of the World''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wallace|first=Chris|title=James Franco | url = http://www.manoftheworld.com/gallery/james-franco.html | newspaper=[[Man of the World (magazine)|Man of the World]]|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Franco has described himself as Jewish;<ref name="bostonref1"/> regarding his secular upbringing, he told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he feels as if he has "missed out on the Jewish experience", but has been told not to worry about that by his Jewish friends and said in the same interview that he likes "the idea of religion as a source of community." When asked if he was a "believer," he responded "In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question."<ref name=niadraug/>

Due to his support for the [[LGBT]] community, and his portrayal of multiple gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has often come under fire from various media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. "Or, you know what," he quipped, "maybe I’m just gay."<ref>{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Donnelly|title=James Franco's Maybe I'm just gay'- and why we love it|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/01/james-franco-gay.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}</ref> In a March 2015 interview with ''Four Two Nine'' magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay." Franco added, "Well, I like to think that I’m gay in my art and straight in my life."<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Duffy|title=James Franco opens up about his sexuality|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/03/18/james-franco-opens-up-about-his-sexuality/|newspaper=[[Pink News]] |date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref>

The rumors concerning his sexuality led to a [[Gawker]] article linking him to a ''[[New York Post]]'' Page Six [[blind item]] about a [[closeted gay]] actor, nicknamed "the Gay Rapist". Despite the victim of the alleged attack denying that it was Franco, two magazines then contacted Franco's lawyer to alert them that they might run stories suggesting his involvement, but were unable to, as at least part of their stories were fabricated.<ref name="playboy"/> However, Gawker refused to take their article down as they were simply reporting what another outlet published and instead offered him a chance to make a comment about the speculation on its website. He declined, hoping it would die down. The actor later called the episode very offensive because he has friends who have been raped.<ref name="playboy"/>

After meeting on the set of ''[[Whatever It Takes (2000 film)|Whatever It Takes]]'', Franco dated co-star [[Marla Sokoloff]] for five years.<ref name="peoplebio"/> He was later in a relationship with actress [[Ahna O'Reilly]], until 2011.<ref name="peoplebio">{{cite news |title=James Franco Biography|last=Dinh|first=Mai|author2=Janet Murphy|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-08-03-james-franco_N.htm|title='Pineapple' star Franco digs deep, plays stoner and serious|last=Freydkin|first=Donna|date=August 3, 2008|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}</ref> He confirmed their separation in an interview for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's August 2011 issue, saying that his interest in education got between them.<ref name="playboy">{{cite news |url=http://www.playboy.com/magazine/james-franco-interview/2 |title=Playboy Interview: JAMES FRANCO |first=Stephen |last=Rebello |newspaper=[[Playboy]] |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

==Education==
Franco, dissatisfied with his career's direction,{{r|anderson20100725}} reenrolled at [[UCLA]] in autumn 2006 as an [[English studies|English]] major with a creative writing concentration.

The actor opted against watching the 2011 Academy Award nominees be announced (where he was a top contender) in favor of attending class.

It was announced on March 2011 that Franco will teach a fall semester course on modifying poetry into short films to ten to twelve third-year graduate film students at NYU. The course will focus mainly on production, meaning that the students will be in charge of creating their own film based on poetry. At the time of the announcement, the actor had yet to put together a syllabus, but has until the summer time to do so.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/29/james-franco-nyu-course/ |first=Keith |last=Staskiewicz |title=James Franco to teach film course at NYU, but no syllabus as of yet |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref>

When asked about his education, Franco said that he loves school and that it keeps him focused as well as grounded. "I go to school because I love being around people who are interested in what I'm interested in and I'm having a great experience...

''Pineapple Express'' producer [[Judd Apatow]] has said of him: "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]'' on set.

In an interview with ''Showbiz411'', on September 23, 2010, Franco made the erroneous public announcement that he received a "D" grade in "Acting" class at the NYU Graduate Film School.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Nmf-Chm1w | title=EXCLUSIVE: James Franco talks to Roger Friedman about his 'D' in acting class & falling asleep. | publisher=Youtube | accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref> It was in fact a "Directing the Actor" class. Franco admitted to missing most of his classes that semester. A professor at New York University, José Angel Santana, alleged that Franco did not earn his grades while attending that school, stating that Franco missed over 80% of his classes and only received high marks and a degree because of his celebrity status as an actor.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/12/19/professor-nyu-fired-me-for-giving-james-franco-d/ | title=Professor: NYU Fired Me for Giving James Franco a 'D' | work=Fox News | date=December 19, 2011}}</ref> In September 2012, Santana filed a lawsuit against Franco for defamation seeking unspecified damages.<ref>{{cite news |last=Child |first=Ben |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/06/james-franco-teacher-sues-defamation |title=James Franco's former teacher sues actor for defamation | work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Doty |first=Meriah |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/bully-james-franco-being-sued-former-nyu-professor-180200888.html |title='Bully' James Franco being sued by former NYU professor |work=[[Yahoo!

==Charitable work==
Franco has said "aiding others is the key to life, the key to happiness and, as an actor, you can get wrapped up in yourself and your career...A little secret is one of the greatest ways to break that is to stop thinking about yourself for a second."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-12-08/entertainment/27083812_1_actors-studio-james-lipton-james-franco |title=James Franco credits obsession, UCLA education, giving back for success: 'Inside the Actors Studio' |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]| location = New York City |author=Chen, Joyce |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2011 }}</ref> When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his ''Spider-Man'' co-star [[Kirsten Dunst]] for advice. At the suggestion of Dunst, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/2011/01/17/20110117james-franco-kirsten-dunst-charity-advice.html |title=James Franco saved by Kirsten Dunst's charity advice |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

On March 31, 2011, the actor took part in "An Evening with James Franco," a Washington DC dinner benefit for 826DC, a non-profit foundation created to help neighborhood students reach their goals, as well as provide after-school literature programs and workshops that encourage them to improve their writing skills. Franco became involved with Dave Eggers' [[826 National]] after Eggers asked him to do a conceptual idea for the program, and he directed a documentary for them and has since been a supporter of them. At the event, he spoke about how he thought schools needed to be more original with their literature programs. "Writing can do things that video cannot," he added.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonlife.com/2011/04/04/charity-spotlight-evening-with-james-franco/ |title=Charity Spotlight: Evening With James Franco |newspaper=Washington Life Magazine |date=April 4, 2011 |author=Farazad, Roshan |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref> In April 2011, Franco autographed a T-shirt that would be auctioned off through the Yoshiki Foundation, with the proceeds being donated for [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japanese tsunami relief]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/04/13/robert-pattinson-japan-relief/ |first=Jocelyn |last=Vena |title=Robert Pattinson Takes Off Shirt For Japan Relief |publisher=MTV |publisher=Viacom |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref> On June 14, he was honored by [[amfAR]], the foundation for [[AIDS research]], at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].
