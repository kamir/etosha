'''''USA Today''''' is a national American daily newspaper published by the [[Gannett Company]]. It was founded by [[Al Neuharth]] on September 15, 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/marketing/media_kit/pressroom/press_kit_usat.html |title=USA Today: Press Room : Press Kit |accessdate= May 26, 2012}}</ref> The newspaper vies with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' for the position of having the widest [[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation|circulation of any newspaper in the United States]], a distinction it had previously held since 2003.

==History==
{{prose|section|date=February 2015}}
On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of what would become ''USA Today''.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday">{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/marketing/media_kit/pressroom/timeline.html |title=USA TODAY Media Kit :: Press Room :: Press Kit :: Timeline |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref>  Early, regional prototypes included ''East Bay Today'' in [[Oakland, California]], a late 1970's morning edition of the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', owned by Gannett at the time.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=1422 | title=The Oakland Tribune Rides Again | author=Michael Liedtke | publisher=ajr.org | date=October 1991 | accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref>

On December 5, 1981, the Gannett Board of Directors approved the launch of the ''USA Today'' newspaper.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

On September 15, 1982, ''USA Today'' first launched in the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. area for the cost of 25 cents (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|25|1982|fmt=c}}¢ today).<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

In the fourth quarter of 1985, ''USA Today'' became the second largest newspaper in the U.S., having reached a daily circulation of 1.4 million.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

On May 6, 1986, ''USA Today'' started its first international edition via satellite, in Switzerland.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

On January 29, 1988, ''USA Today'' published the largest edition in its history; this 78-page Super Bowl edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

In April 1994, ''USA Today'' launched a Monday-Friday International Print Edition, rather than Tuesday&nbsp;— Saturday, to accommodate business travelers.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

In April 1995, ''USA Today'' launched its website: USA Today Online.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

In 2010, ''USA Today'' launched the USA Today API for sharing data with partners of all types.<ref>{{cite web| title =Driving Real-World Enterprise & B2B Results With APIs| publisher =Mashery| url =http://www.mashery.com/sites/default/files/whitepapers/Mashery-Powers-Enterprise.pdf | accessdate = February 7, 2013}}</ref> On January 4, 2014, ''USA Today'' acquired Reviewed.com.<ref name="usatoday30.usatoday" />

In the first quarter of 2014, Gannett began inserting a condensed version of ''USA Today'' into 31 other newspapers in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35. The aim: to shore up ''USA Today''{{'}}s circulation after regaining its position as the top circulating weekday newspaper in the [[United States]], in October 2013.<ref name="USA Today distribution">{{cite news|title=Gannett to distribute USA TODAY edition to 35 papers|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/12/11/usa-today-butterfly-expansion/3965309/|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=USA Today|date=December 11, 2013}}</ref> On September 3, 2014, ''USA Today'' said they will be cutting roughly 70 jobs.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/business/media/usa-today-cuts-newsroom-and-business-side-staff.html?_r=0 | title=USA Today Cuts 70 Employees From Newsroom and Business Staff | work=The New York Times | date=September 3, 2014 | accessdate=September 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Layout and format==
''USA Today'' is known for synthesizing news down to easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories. In the main edition seen in the US and some [[Canadian]] cities, each edition consists of four sections: News (the oft-labeled "front page" section), Money, Sports, and Life. On Fridays, two Life sections are included: the regular Life for entertainment (subtitled ''Weekend''; section E), which features television, a DVD column, [[Film criticism|film reviews]] and trends, and a travel supplement called ''Destinations & Diversions'' (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.

The paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition. ''USA Today'' prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.

Each section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page, with News being blue (section A), Money with green (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D). Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for [[business travel]] trends and the [[Olympics]]; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the [[PGA Tour]] preview, [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournament]]s, [[Memorial Day]] auto races ([[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Coca-Cola 600]]), [[National Football League|NFL]] opening weekend and the [[Super Bowl]]) previously used the orange color, but now use the sports red in their bonus sections. On days featuring bonus sections or business holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. The stock tables were discontinued after the last redesign in 2012 due to the myriad electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers. Gannett's television stations also now mainly use the ''USA Today'' coloring scheme in the company's newest graphics package, which was introduced in late 2012.

[[File:USA Today Logo.svg|175px|thumb|left|Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012.]]

In many ways, ''USA Today'' is set up to break the typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages<ref>{{cite web|website=Dictionary.com|title=Reefer, noun 3|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reefer}}</ref>), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside. As a national newspaper, ''USA Today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps and temperature lists for the entire United States and many cities throughout the world, with data provided by [[The Weather Channel]] meteorologists. In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is a graphic called "Weather Focus", which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event. On Mondays, the Money section uses its back page to present an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly movements against the [[S&P 500]]. Like most national papers, ''USA Today'' does not carry [[comic strip]]s.

Book coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart, is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the official full [[A.C. Nielsen]] [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the [[Mediabase]] survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay spins on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Advertising coverage is seen in the Monday Money section, which often includes a review of a current television ad, and after [[Super Bowl Sunday]], a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ''Ad Track'' live survey.

[[Image:USA Today building.jpg|thumb|left|''USA Today'' is headquartered in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]]<!-- Despite the McLean, VA address, the HQ is in Tysons Corner -->.]]
One of the staples of the News section is a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length [[Associated Press]] reports highlighting one story of note in each state, the [[District of Columbia]], and one U.S. territory.

Some traditions have been retained, however. The [[news style|lead story]] still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But ''USA Today'' is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a newsstand. The overall design and layout of ''USA Today'' has been described as neo-Victorian.<ref>{{cite web

The new styles, embodied most famously in ''USA Today'' and its clones, mark a return to the mystifying abundance of facts and stories that newspapers of the industrial revolution made visually present to readers.}}</ref>

Also, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, are "USA Today Snapshots", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in (for example, a snapshot in "Life" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time). These "Snapshots" are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter (using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute (with the source in the box below the graph in fine print to show credit).

Starting in February 2008, the newspaper added a magazine supplement called ''Open Air'', appearing several times a year. Various other [[advertorial]]s appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.

==Opinion section==
The opinion section prints ''USA Today'' editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the Board of Contributors,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USA-TODAY-board-of-contributors.htm | work=USA Today | title=USA Today's Opinion columnists | date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the ''USA Today'' editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view; alongside the editorial board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USATODAY-editorials-debate.htm | work=USA Today | title=About USA Today Editorials/Debate | date=April 6, 2010}}</ref>

As of 2010, the Editorial Page Editor was Brian Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding in 1982. Other members of the Editorial Board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg, executive Forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/Forum page editor Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, George Hager, and Saundra Torry.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USATODAY-editorial-board.htm | work=USA Today | title=USA Today's Editorial Board | date=April 6, 2010}}</ref> The newspaper's website calls this group "demographically and ideologically diverse."<ref name="usatoday" />

==Newsroom restructuring==
On August 27, 2010, ''USA Today'' announced that it would be reorganizing its newsroom. 130 people were to be laid off, a new publication called ''USA Today Sports'' would be created, and the paper would be shifting its focus away from print and more on digital platforms like USA Today.com and mobile phone applications (apps).

===2011 tweaks===
On January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format, changing a few looks of the front pages of sections.<ref>{{cite web|last=Apple |first=Charles |url=http://apple.copydesk.org/2011/01/25/more-about-that-usa-today-design-update/ |title=More about that USA Today design update |publisher=American Copy Editors Society |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref>

Some of the changes include:
* A larger logo at the top.
* A new [[sans-serif]] font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories.
* Increasing and decreasing of [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]]s and white space in order to present a cleaner style.

===2012 redesign===
On September 14, 2012, ''USA Today'' underwent the first major redesign in its history with brand design firm [[Wolff Olins]], in commemoration for the 30th anniversary of the paper's first edition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gosling|first=Emily|title=Wolff Olins creates new USA Today branding|url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/wolff-olins-creates-new-usa-today-branding/3035245.article|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=DesignWeek|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> The print edition of ''USA Today'' now features the additions of a page covering technology stories and an increased number of color pages, while retaining longtime elements.<ref name="Hagey">{{cite news|last=Hagey |first=Keach |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444709004577649682788312016.html |title=USA Today Redesigns Paper, Website |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> The "globe" logo used since the paper's inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day's top stories.<ref name="Hagey"/>

The paper's website was also revamped from the ground up using a new, in-house [[content management system]] known as Presto, and a design created by [[Fantasy Interactive]]. The site was designed to be more interactive, provide optimizations for [[mobile device|mobile]] and [[touchscreen]] devices, provide "high impact" advertising units, and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to use Presto and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014.<ref name=poynter-gannettpresto>{{cite news|title=Case Study: Gannett's monumental task — A content management system for all|url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/business-news/the-biz-blog/journalism-and-business-values/257767/case-study-gannetts-monumental-task-a-content-management-system-for-all/|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=Poynter|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> Additionally, to increase their ties to USA Today, Gannett's television stations began to phase in a new on-air appearance for news programming that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper.<ref name=tvnc-newgraphics>{{cite web|title=Gannett Stations Clean Up Their Graphics|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/64783/gannett-stations-clean-up-their-graphics|publisher=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>

===Personnel===
In May 2012, Larry Kramer was appointed president and publisher of the paper. The 40-year media industry veteran and former president of CBS Digital Media, is tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it seeks to increase revenue from its digital operations.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/larry-kramer-usa-today-publisher_n_1517611.html "Larry Kramer Named Publisher of USA Today"], ''Huffington Post'', May 15, 2012.</ref> In July 2012, Kramer hired David Callaway as the paper's editor-in-chief from ''[[MarketWatch]]''. Kramer had founded ''MarketWatch'' at CBS in 1997 and hired Callaway as its top editor two years later.  Callaway had previously worked at [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] covering the banking, investment-banking and asset-management businesses throughout Europe and at the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', where he co-wrote a daily financial column on "comings and goings in the Boston business district".<ref>Wilkerson, David B., [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/callaway-to-become-top-usa-today-editor-2012-07-10 "Callaway to become top USA Today editor"], ''MarketWatch'', July 10, 2012.

==''USA Today: The Television Show''==
In 1987,  Gannett and producer [[Grant Tinker]] began developing a [[newsmagazine]] series for [[Broadcast syndication|first-run syndication]] that attempted to bring the breezy style of ''USA Today'' to television.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8040929.html And Now, Folks...

Retrieved September 14, 2012 via [[HighBeam Research]].</ref> The result was the ''USA Today: The Television Show'' (later retitled ''USA Today on TV'', then shortened to simply ''USA Today''), which debuted on September 12, 1988.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1278475.html Now, Here's the Good News...;USA Today's TV Spinoff, Focusing on 'the Journalism of Hope'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 12, 1988. Retrieved September 14, 2012 via HighBeam Research.</ref> Correspondents on the series included Edie Magnus, [[Robin Young]], [[Boyd Matson]], Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, Ann Abernathy, [[Bill Macatee]] and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper itself, the show was divided into four "sections" corresponding to the different parts of the paper&nbsp;– News, Money, Sports and Life.

The series was plagued by low ratings and negative reviews from critics throughout its run; the program also suffered from airing in undesirable timeslots in certain markets, including in the country's largest [[media market]], New York City, where [[WCBS-TV]] aired the program in a pre-dawn early morning slot. [[WNBC]] acquired the series from WCBS five months into the program's run, airing it at 9:30 AM, but it fared no better in its new time slot.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156070337.html 'USA Today on TV' Remains a Secret in NYC], '[[Albany Times Union]]'', August 21, 1988.
