'''''The Faculty''''' is a 1998 [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] (''Scream [[Scream (1996 film)|1]]'' and ''[[Scream 2|2]]'') and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]] (''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn (film)|From Dusk Till Dawn]]''). The film stars [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Shawn Hatosy]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Laura Harris]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Piper Laurie]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]], [[Salma Hayek]], and [[Jon Stewart]].

==Plot==
One evening at Herrington High School in [[Ohio]], a few teachers, the head football [[Coach (sport)|coach]] and the [[school principal|principal]] leave after discussions about the school's budget. Having left her keys behind, Principal Drake ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]) returns to retrieve them. In her office, she is barred from leaving by the Coach Willis ([[Robert Patrick]]) who becomes increasingly erratic, then impulsively stakes a pencil through her hand and Drake facially slashes Willis with keys. Drake flees to the main school doors only to find the handles chained up and drama teacher Mrs. Olsen ([[Piper Laurie]]) is outside, unable to assist Drake. Willis is then ambushed by Drake hiding in a room, smashing a jar on his head, seizes his keyset and grabs scissors for a weapon. Drake runs to the doors with Willis at her tail, unable to immediately find the correct key allows Willis to get upclose, and obstruct door closure but Drake successfully closes the padlock. Olsen then consecutively stabs Drake with the scissors, with an emotionless face, and reveals that Olsen is in cahoots with Willis.

The following morning, the film's protagonist students are introduced. Casey Connor ([[Elijah Wood]]), a dedicated but perpetually harassed and routinely bullied [[photographer]] for the school newspaper, is the unappreciated friend of Delilah Profitt ([[Jordana Brewster]]) (the paper's [[editor-in-chief]] and head [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]). Delilah's boyfriend Stan Rosado ([[Shawn Hatosy]]) is contemplating quitting the school's football team to pursue more academic ambitions, to Delilah's disapproval. Zeke Tyler ([[Josh Hartnett]]), a student repeating his senior year who sells, among other illegal items, a powdery [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-like drug he manufactures and distributes, is confronted by Miss Elizabeth Burke ([[Famke Janssen]]), who expresses concern for him over his illegal activities. Naive transfer student from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; Marybeth Louise Hutchinson ([[Laura Harris]]), attempts to befriend self-styled outcast Stokely "Stokes" Mitchell ([[Clea DuVall]]), who deliberately confirms rumors of lesbianism even though she has a crush on Stan and is a fan of science-fiction novels. Marybeth, on the other hand, develops a crush on Zeke.

While eating lunch on the football field, Casey notices a strange creature on the field. He takes it to Professor Furlong ([[Jon Stewart]]), where the specimen is examined and believed to be a new species of [[cephalopod]]-specific parasite called a [[mesozoan]]. Delilah takes Casey into the teacher's lounge to find a story for the front page, where they hide in a closet. They witness the coach and the drama teacher assault the [[School nursing|school nurse]] ([[Salma Hayek]]) by forcing one of the creatures into her ear. They also find the body of Mrs. Brummel (Susan Willis). Casey and Delilah flee, and Casey calls the police. Principal Drake claims nothing is wrong and that Casey is seeking attention.

The next day, Casey tells the others that he believes the teachers are being controlled by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] and goes to show them the creature he found, which is gone. When confronting Professor Furlong about the creature, he becomes defensive and attempts to infect them. Zeke cuts off Furlong's fingers and then injects his homemade drugs into Furlong's eye, seemingly killing him.

Concerned about Casey's suggestion that everyone at the school could potentially be infected, Zeke takes everyone he trusts to his house where he examines and experiments with Casey's specimen. He discovers that it needs water to survive and can be killed by his drugs because it is a [[diuretic]]. Zeke makes everyone take some of his drug to prove they are human and unaffected. Delilah is revealed as infected, and she destroys Zeke's lab and most of his drug supply before escaping.

Acting on Stokes' speculation that killing the queen alien would revert everyone to normal, the group returns to the school, where their [[American football|football]] team is playing a game and infecting opposing players. Believing Principal Drake to be the queen, they isolate her in the gym and fatally shoot her. Stan goes outside to see if it worked, but is infected by the coach. Zeke and Casey go to Zeke's car to retrieve more of Zeke's drugs. Casey leads infected students away from Zeke, who encounters Miss Burke in the parking lot and seemingly kills her when he makes his escape.

Casey returns to the gym, where Marybeth reveals herself to be the queen, having faked taking the test earlier. She attacks Stokes, who is stunned at the revelation. Casey and Stokes flee to the swimming pool where Stokes is injured and infected. Zeke and Casey go to the locker room, where Marybeth reverts to her human disguise, naked. She explains that she is taking over Earth because her own planet is dying. Marybeth transforms back to the queen and renders Zeke unconscious by throwing him into a locker. Casey takes the drug and tricks the queen into following him into the retracting [[bleachers]], thus trapping her. Casey then stabs the drug into the queen's eye to kill it. The queen infects Casey with her dying breath, but Casey and Stokes return to normal upon the queen's death, while Zeke revives.

One month later, everyone has returned to normal. Stan and Stokes begin dating, and Zeke takes Stan's place on the football team (while Miss Burke affectionately watches him practice). Casey begins dating Delilah and has become a local hero. Professor Furlong is adjusting to life with reduced eyesight and fewer fingers.

==Production==
In 1990, David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel wrote their first draft of the script and sent it out, but there were no buyers. It wasn't until after the success of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' that Miramax bought the script and rushed it into production. Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein brought in Kevin Williamson to do rewrites, keeping the basic story, but rewriting the dialogue and adding new characters to make it more "hip". Originally, Williamson was set to direct the film, but he chose not to so he could direct his self-penned script ''[[Teaching Mrs. Tingle]]''. The Weinsteins brought in Robert Rodriguez to direct the film instead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=The Faculty |url=http://www.teako170.com/faculty.html |publisher=LA Times |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref>

==Reception==
Reviews were mixed. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] tallied 50 reviews from critics (with 27 listed as positive and 23 listed as negative) to give ''The Faculty'' a 54% rating, calling it a "rip-off of other sci-fi thrillers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/faculty/|title=The Faculty - Consensus: Rip-off of other sci-fi thrillers|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|date=|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave ''The Faculty'' a score of 61.<ref>{{cite web|author=MS.|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/faculty?q=the%20faculty|title=The Faculty: Generally favorable reviews|publisher=Metacritic.com|date=1998-12-25|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>

===Cult film status===
Later commentators suggest that a [[cult film]] had been born and was maturing to meet an appreciative audience. In 2013, for example, Aliya Whiteley wrote an essay, "Revisiting Robert Rodriguez's ''The Faculty''," which points out the movie's influences and homages (as opposed to "rip-offs"):

<blockquote>Mix ''[[Invasion Of The Body Snatchers]]'' with ''[[The Thing from Another World|The Thing]]''. Throw in some ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'', a spoonful of ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', and a pinch of ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', and you've got a big mess of a movie set in a school that’s being taken over by a [[Peer pressure|conformist]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], [[Divide and rule|one teacher at a time]]. You’ve got the very funny, occasionally scary, quite gory, and extremely entertaining 1998 Robert Rodriguez film called ''The Faculty''.</blockquote>

Whiteley added, "It's all about examining the tropes of science fiction with a smart, funny angle. Half of the fun in this film is in identifying where you first came across a certain character's name or saw a particular special effect. For instance, there's a brilliant moment with a head on legs that I defy you to watch and not think of a [[The Thing (1982 film)|certain John Carpenter film]]."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-faculty/27623/revisiting-robert-rodriguezs-the-faculty |author= Whiteley, Aliya |date= 11 Oct 2013 |title= Revisiting Robert Rodriguez's ''The Faculty'' |publisher= [[Dennis Publishing]] |accessdate= April 21, 2014}}</blockquote></ref>

Keith Phipps also noticed the nostalgic homage when he described the film as "a Kevin Williamson-scripted high-school variation on ''Invasion Of The Body Snatchers''."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/article/robert-rodriguez-13753 |author= Phipps, Keith  |date= February 14, 2002 |title= Robert Rodriguez: Interview |publisher= ''[[The AV Club]]'' |accessdate= April 21, 2014}}</ref>

In 2005, a critic for ''Movies Made Easy'' enthused about the film and explained its long life.

==Home Media==
''The Faculty'' was one of the few Robert Rodriguez films not to receive special treatment on DVD. Missing are traditional extras typical for a Robert Rodriguez DVD including "10 Minute Film School", [[audio commentary]], and making-of featurettes.

Several scenes involving an additional character named Venus, played by [[Kidada Jones]], were shown in previews but cut from the film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
