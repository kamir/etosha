Forbes named magazine artist Kyle Reeves as Vice President to David Churbuck. David founded ''Forbes''{{'}} Web site in 1996. The site uncovered [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]]' [[journalistic fraud]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 1998, an article that drew attention to [[internet journalism]]. At the peak of media coverage of alleged [[Toyota]] sudden unintended acceleration in 2010 it exposed the California "runaway Prius" as a hoax, as well as running five other articles by Michael Fumento challenging the entire media premise of Toyotas suddenly gone bad. The site, like the magazine, publishes many lists focusing on billionaires and their possessions, especially expensive homes, a critical aspect of the website's apparent popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gawker.com/news/jobs/motley-to-leave-time-inc-plus-more-jobhopping-fun-162725.php|title=Jobs: Motley to Leave Time Inc., Plus More Job-Hopping Fun|accessdate=January 5, 2008}}</ref>
Forbes.com employs the slogan "Home Page For The World's Business Leaders" and sometimes claims to be the world's most widely visited business web site.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/technology/28forbes.html|title=At Forbes.com, Lots of Glitter but Maybe Not So Many Visitors|first=Peter|last=Edmonston|date=August 28, 2006|work=New York Times|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

The company's current chief executive officer is Mike Perlis; the current chief product officer is Lewis D'vorkin; the current editor of the magazine is Randall Lane.

Forbes.com also publishes subscription investment newsletters, and an online guide to web sites, ''Best of the Web''.

Forbes.com is part of Forbes Digital, a division of Forbes Media LLC. Forbes' holdings include a portion of
[[RealClearPolitics]]. Together these sites reach more than 27 million unique visitors each month.

The 2009 ''Times'' report said that, while "one of the top five financial sites by traffic [throwing] off an estimated $70&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million a year in revenue, [it] never yielded the hoped-for [[public offering]]".<ref name="NYT01" />

''Forbes'' currently allows advertisers to publish blog posts on its website alongside regular editorial content through a program called AdVoice, which accounts for more than 10 percent its digital revenue.<ref>{{cite news|title=Forbes gives advertisers an editorial voice|publisher=emedia|url=http://www.emediavitals.com/content/forbes-gives-advertisers-editorial-voice |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109153816/http://www.emediavitals.com/content/forbes-gives-advertisers-editorial-voice |archivedate=2013-11-09}}</ref> The website also uses a "contributor model" in which a wide network of "contributors" writes and publishes articles directly on the website.<ref name="contributorstory" /> Contributors are paid based on traffic to their Forbes.com pages; the site has received contributions from over 2,500 individuals, and some contributors have earned over US$100,000, according to the company.<ref name=contributorstory>{{cite web|last=Bartlett|first=Rachel|title=The Forbes contributor model: Technology, feedback and incentives|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/the-forbes-contributor-model-technology-feedback-and-incentives/s2/a554255/|publisher=journalism.co.uk|accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>
