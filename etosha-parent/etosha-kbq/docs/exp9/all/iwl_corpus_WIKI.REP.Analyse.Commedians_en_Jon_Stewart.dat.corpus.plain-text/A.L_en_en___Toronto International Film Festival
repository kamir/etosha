The '''Toronto International Film Festival''' ('''TIFF''', stylized as '''tiff.''') is a publicly attended [[film festival]] held each September in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. In 2012, 372 films from 72 countries were screened at 34 screens in downtown Toronto venues, welcoming an estimated 400,000 attendees, over 4000 of whom were industry professionals.<ref>http://s3.amazonaws.com/tiff-prod/press_releases/155/Festival%202013%20dates_original.pdf?1352499259</ref> TIFF starts the Thursday night after [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] (the first Monday in September in Canada) and lasts for eleven days.

==Background==
The Toronto International Film Festival was founded by William Marshall, Henk van der Kolk and Dusty Cohl.<ref>[http://tiff.net/abouttiff/organization/boardofdirectors]</ref> Piers Handling has been the festival's director and CEO since 1994, while Noah Cowan became co-director of TIFF in 2004. In late 2007, Cowan became the artistic director of [[Bell Lightbox|TIFF Bell Lightbox]], while long-time programmer [[Cameron Bailey]] succeeded as co-director; as of 2013, Bailey also holds the position of artistic director.<ref>[http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/14/cameron-bailey-named-artistic-director-of-toronto-international-film-festival/ "Cameron Bailey named artistic director of Toronto International Film Festival"]. ''[[National Post]]'', March 14, 2012.</ref>

TIFF was once centered on the [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] neighbourhood, but the [[Toronto Entertainment District]] later gained a greater level of prominence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/851243 |work=The Toronto Star |author=Raju Mudhar |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2010-09-07 |title=From mega clubs to mega culture in Entertainment District}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toronto.com/article/696280?bn=1 |work=Toronto.com |author=Kate Allen |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2011-08-25 |title=TIFF's great migration}}</ref><!-- As of 2013, TIFF maintains extensive connections with the Yorkville area.<ref>{{cite web

As of 2013, TIFF's primary focus is independent cinema, and the festival features retrospectives of national cinemas and individual directors, highlights of Canadian cinema, and a variety of African, South American, and Asian films.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} In particular, the world premieres of a number of Indian films have occurred at TIFF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?ShowID=329&Id=ENTEN20090105686 |work=NDTV |author=Indo-Asian News Service |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2011-08-25 |title=TIFF to have strong Indian flavour}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Day12filmfestboxoffice2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|TIFF box office at the [[Manulife Centre]] in 2006]]
The Toronto International Film Festival, known originally as "The Festival of Festivals", was founded in 1976 at the [[Windsor Arms Hotel]] by Bill Marshall, Henk Van der Kolk and Dusty Cohl.<ref>{{Cite web|last = Stavrou

In 1994, the decision was made to replace the name "Festival of Festivals" with "Toronto International Film Festival". From 1994 to 2009, the umbrella organization running TIFF was named "Toronto International Film Festival Group" (TIFFG). In 2009, the umbrella organization TIFFG was renamed to TIFF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.torontointernationalfilmfestival.ca/abouttiff/organization/tiffhistory |title=TIFF History |accessdate=2010-09-21 |publisher=Toronto International Film Festival}}</ref>

In 2001, Perspective Canada, the programme that had focused on Canadian films since 1984, was replaced by two programmes:
*Canada First!, a forum for Canadian filmmakers presenting their first feature-length work, featuring eight to 15 films, and
*Short Cuts Canada, which includes 30-40 Canadian [[short film]]s.

In 2004, TIFF was featured as the site of murder mystery in the film ''[[Jiminy Glick in Lalawood]]'', a comedy film starring [[Martin Short]].

In 2008, [[Rose McGowan]] caused controversy at a TIFF press conference for her film [[Fifty Dead Men Walking]], when she noted that "I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/director-apologises-for-rose-mcgowans-ira-comments-13978481.html |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=2008–2011|title=Director apologises for Rose McGowan's IRA comments|author=The Globe and Mail|agency=Phillip Crawley, Publisher}}</ref>

===Notable film premieres===
Films such as ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'', ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', ''[[127 Hours]]'', ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'', ''[[Singapore Sling (1990 film)|Singapore Sling]]'', and ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' have premiered at TIFF. [[Jamie Foxx]]'s portrayal of [[Ray Charles]] ultimately won him the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] while ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' went on to win eight Oscars at the 2009 Academy Awards. ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'', which won the 2009 TIFF People's Choice Award, went on to win two Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards. ''[[The King's Speech (film)|The King's Speech]]'', the winner of the 2010 TIFF People's Choice Award, won four Oscars at the 83rd Academy Awards, while ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]'', the winner of the 2012 TIFF People's Choice Award, went to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for [[Jennifer Lawrence]].

Many Hollywood studios premiere their films in Toronto due to TIFF's easy-going non-competitive nature, relatively inexpensive costs (when compared to European festivals), eager film-fluent audiences and convenient timing.<ref>{{Cite news

=== TIFF Bell Lightbox===
[[File:Lightbox 2010-09-11 II.JPG|thumb|TIFF Bell Lightbox]]
In 2007, the Festival Group began construction on [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], a new facility at the corner of King and John Streets in downtown Toronto on land donated by [[Ivan Reitman]] and family. The $181 million facility is named for founding sponsor [[Bell Canada]], with additional support from the [[Government of Ontario]] and [[Government of Canada]].

In 2010, the organization opened a new headquarters at the intersection of King St and John St, in a facility called [[Bell Lightbox|TIFF Bell Lightbox]]. The facility, designed by local firm, [[KPMB Architects]], provides extensive year-round galleries, cinemas, archives and activities for cinephiles.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/tiff/interviews-and-features/article1702853.ece | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Guy | last=Dixon | title=Lightbox aims to draw filmmakers to its facilities - The Globe and Mail | date=2010-09-09}}</ref> The 5-storey facility contains 5 cinemas, 2 gallery spaces, film archives and an extensive reference library, study spaces, film lab facility, and a research centre. There is also a gift shop, two restaurants, a lounge, a cafe, and a three-storey atrium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Let there be lightbox|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=176653|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=NOW|date=9–16 September 2010|author=Norman Wilner}}</ref> Cooperatively with Daniels Corporation, there is a 46-storey condominium atop, called the Festival Tower.

The first film screening was [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]]'s ''[[Trigger (film)|Trigger]]''. The first exhibition was a retrospective on [[Tim Burton]], organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York). Subsequent exhibitions included Fellini: Spectacular Obsessions, Grace Kelly: From Movie Star to Princess, and Designing 007: 50 Years of Bond Style, all of which were organized by TIFF, as well as one called ''Essential Cinema'', featuring posters, images and props from TIFF's ''The Essential 100'' list of films.<ref>{{cite news|title=No place like home: Toronto film fest opens new HQ|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/sep/09/no-place-like-home-toronto-film-fest-opens-new-hq/|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=U-T San Diego News|date=9 September 2010|author=David Germain|agency=The San Diego Union-Tribune, LLC}}</ref>

==Awards==
===People's Choice Award===
Given that TIFF lacks a jury and is non-competitive, regular awards handed out at other festivals for categories such as "Best Film" or "Best Actress" do not exist at the Toronto International Film Festival.  The major prize, the People's Choice Award, is given to a feature-length film with the highest ratings as voted by the TIFF-going populace.<ref>{{Cite news
