'''Arthur Gordon "Art" Linkletter''' (born "Gordon Arthur Kelly" July 17, 1912 – May 26, 2010) was a Canadian-born American [[Radio personality|radio]] and [[television personality]]. He was the host of ''[[Art Linkletter's House Party|House Party]]'', which ran on [[CBS]] radio and television for 25 years, and ''[[People Are Funny]]'', on [[NBC]] radio and TV for 19 years.

Linkletter was famous for interviewing children on ''House Party'' and ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]'', which led to a series of books quoting children. He became a [[naturalized]] United States citizen in 1942.

==Early life and career==
Linkletter was born '''Gordon Arthur Kelly''' in [[Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]]. In his autobiography, ''Confessions of a Happy Man'' (1960), he revealed that he had no contact with his natural parents or his sister or two brothers since he was abandoned when only a few weeks old. He was adopted by Mary (née Metzler) and Fulton John Linkletter, an evangelical preacher.<ref name="LinkletterTIME">{{cite news

When he was five, his family moved to [[San Diego]], [[California]], where he graduated from [[San Diego High School]] at age 16. During the early years of the Great Depression, he rode trains around the country doing odd jobs and meeting a wide variety of people.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news

</ref>  In 1934, he earned a bachelor's degree from San Diego State Teachers College (now [[San Diego State University]]), where he was a member of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity. While attending San Diego State, he played for [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|the basketball team]] and was a member of the swimming team. He had previously planned to attend [[Springfield College]] but did not for financial reasons.

In 1935 he met Lois Foerster. They were married at Grace Lutheran Church in San Diego, November 28, 1935. Their marriage lasted until Linkletter's death, {{frac|74|1|2}} years later.

He earned a degree in teaching, but worked as a radio announcer at [[KLSD (AM)|KGB]] in San Diego. Radio paid better than teaching, and Linkletter directed radio programs for fairs and expositions in the mid-1930s.  In the 1940s Linkletter lived in San Francisco and worked in radio. In 1943, Linkletter pleaded guilty to falsely claiming US citizenship;<ref>{{cite journal | title = Linkletter Pleads | work = [[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising]] | date = January 25, 1943 | page = 26 | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | publisher = Broadcasting Publications, Inc. | location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref> he was fined $500 and permitted to apply for citizenship.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Linkletter Fined | work = Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising | date = February 1, 1943 | page = 26 | volume = 24 | issue = 5}}</ref> In the 1940s, Linkletter worked in Hollywood with [[John Guedel]] on their pioneering radio show, ''[[People Are Funny]]'', which employed audience participation, contests and gags.

[[File:Alinkletter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sam Berman]]'s caricature of Linkletter for NBC's 1947 promotional book]]
Other early television shows Linkletter worked on included ''Life With Linkletter'' with his son Jack (1969–1970) and ''Hollywood Talent Scouts'' (1965–1966). He acted in two movies, ''[[People Are Funny (film)|People Are Funny]]'' (1946) and ''[[Champagne for Caesar]]'' (1950). Linkletter declined the opportunity offered by his friend [[Walt Disney]] to invest in the Disneyland theme park project along with building and operating the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] due to Linkletter's doubts about the park's prospects. But, out of friendship for Disney, Linkletter volunteered his experience as a live program broadcaster to help organize ABC's coverage of the [[Disneyland]] opening in 1955. Besides being an on-air host, he recruited his two co-hosts: [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bob Cummings]]. The park opening experience convinced Linkletter Disneyland was going to be a huge success. When Disney asked what he could do to show his gratitude for the broadcast's role in the successful launching of the park, Linkletter asked for Disneyland's camera and film concession for its first ten years, to which Disney readily agreed. This turned out to be very lucrative.<ref>''[[The "E" Ticket]]'' #40 (2003)</ref> He appeared for two stints of two weeks each, as a guest host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 1962 between [[Jack Paar]]'s departure and Johnny Carson's arrival as its new host.<ref>[http://www.newsfromme.com/2012/06/07/heres-not-yet-johnny/ Here’s…(not yet)…Johnny!]</ref>

In the 1950s, Linkletter became a major investor in and promoter of the [[hula hoop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.flickr.com/photos/christianmontone/4471385049/ |title=1950s Hula Hoop vintage photo ART LINKLETTER and kids &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/30/lkl.00.html | publisher=CNN | work=[[Larry King Live]] |title=Art Linkletter Discusses His Career in Television |date=June 30, 2000}}</ref>

''Art Linkletter's Kids'' was a 1963–64 [[panel (comics)|gag cartoon panel]] drawn by the prolific cartoonist [[Stan Fine]] and distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]]. In 1963, Linkletter became the endorser and spokesman for [[Milton Bradley]]'s The [[The Game of Life|Game of Life]]. His picture appeared on the game's $100,000 bills<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/529366/art-linkletter-rip-1912-2010 |title=Art Linkletter RIP (1912-2010) |publisher=BoardGameGeek |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> and also on the box alongside the statement "I heartily endorse this game".<ref>{{cite web|last=Zenobia |first=Jason |url=http://jasonzenobia.blogspot.com/2010/05/i-heartily-endorse-this-obituary.html |title=The Flaming Chef: "I Heartily Endorse This Obituary" |publisher=Jasonzenobia.blogspot.com |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>

==Later years==
After three public meetings in 1967, an eight-member Los Angeles City Council committee "cleared" Linkletter and City Council Member [[Tom Shepard]] of charges that they were linked in a scheme to influence city purchase of the "financially troubled" [[Valley Music Theater]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]].<ref>Erwin Baker, [http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=512050632&sid=42&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Probe Clears Councilman and Linkletter"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', August 5, 1967, page 3. <code><nowiki>Library card required</nowiki></code></ref>

Linkletter invested wisely,<ref name="NYTobit"/> enabling his considerable philanthropy. In 2005, at the age of 93, he opened the [[Happiest Homecoming on Earth]] celebrations for the 50th anniversary of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. Half a century earlier, he was the commentator on the opening day celebrations in 1955. For this, he was named a [[Disney Legend]].

Linkletter was once a spokesman for National Home Life, an insurance company. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he became a political organizer and a spokesman for the United Seniors Association, now known as [[USA Next]], an alternative to the [[AARP]]. He was also a member of [[Pepperdine University]]'s [[Board of Regents]]. He received a lifetime achievement [[Daytime Emmy]] award in 2003. He was inducted into the [[National Speakers Association]] Speaker Hall of Fame. He was a member of the [[President's Council on Service and Civic Participation]] (which ended in November 2008).

He received honorary degrees from several universities, including his alma mater, San Diego State University; [[Pepperdine University]]; and the [[University of Prince Edward Island]]. He served for many years as a trustee at [[Springfield College]] and donated funds to build the swim center named in his honor.

In 1978 he wrote the foreword to the bestselling self-help book ''Release Your Brakes!'' by James W. Newman, in which he wrote, "I believe none of us should ever stop growing, learning, changing, and being curious about what's going to happen next. None of us is perfect, so we should be eager to learn more and try to be more effective persons in every part of our lives."

In 1988 he appeared as himself on the syndicated sitcom ''[[Small Wonder (TV series)|Small Wonder]]'' in the episode "Come Fly With Me".

==Personal life==
[[Image:ArtLinkletter.PNG|right|thumb|Linkletter on ''The [[Jack Benny]] Show'']]
Linkletter had one of the [[List of people with the longest marriages|longest marriages]] of any celebrity in America, at nearly 75 years. He married Lois Foerster on November 25, 1935, and they had five children: [[Jack Linkletter|Arthur Jack]], Dawn, Robert, Sharon and [[Diane Linkletter|Diane]]. On October 10, 2011, Foerster died at the age of 95.

Art and Lois Linkletter outlived three of their five children. On October 4, 1969, 20-year-old Diane died after jumping out of her sixth-floor kitchen window.<ref name="LinkletterTIME" /> Linkletter claimed that her death was drug related because she was on, or having a flashback from, an [[LSD]] [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] (toxicology tests later determined there were no drugs in Diane's system at the time of her death). After Diane's death, Linkletter spoke out against drugs to prevent children from straying into a drug habit. His record, "We Love You, Call Collect", recorded before her death, featured a discussion about permissiveness in modern society, along with a rebuttal by Diane, titled "Dear Mom and Dad". The record won a [[12th Grammy Awards|1970 Grammy Award]] for the "Best Spoken Word Recording".<ref name="foxnews">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/05/26/tv-host-art-linkletter-passes-away/|title=TV Show Host Art Linkletter Dies at 97|date=2010-05-26|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>

What a guy."<ref name="foxnews" /> He was survived by his wife, Lois and daughters Dawn Griffin and Sharon Linkletter, as well as seven grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.
