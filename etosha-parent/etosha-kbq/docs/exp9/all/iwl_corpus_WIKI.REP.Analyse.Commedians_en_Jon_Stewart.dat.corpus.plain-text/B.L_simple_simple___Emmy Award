The '''Emmy Awards''' are [[United States]] [[television]] [[produce|production]] [[award]]s which are given out each year. They are the television version of the [[Academy Award]]s. The first Emmy Awards were given out on January 25, 1949 at the [[Hollywood Athletic Club]]. [[Shirley Dinsdale]] was the very first person to be given an Emmy in the first awards [[ceremony]]. 

Three [[organization]]s give Emmy Awards:
* The [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] gives the award for American [[prime time]] [[entertainment]] (not including [[sport]]s).
* The [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] gives the award for [[day]]time, sports, [[news]] and [[documentary]] [[television programme|programming]].
* The [[International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] gives the award for programming that is created outside the United States.

The best-known of the awards are the Primetime Awards (some of which are named "Creative Arts Emmys") and the Daytime Emmy Awards.

The Emmy Awards is a [[statue]]tte of a woman with [[wing]]s holding an [[atom]]. It was created by television engineer Louis McManus, using his wife as a model. The [[trophy|trophies]] are made by a [[company]] that has a [[manufacture|manufacturing site]] at the El Dorado Correctional Facility, a [[prison]] in [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], [[Kansas]].
