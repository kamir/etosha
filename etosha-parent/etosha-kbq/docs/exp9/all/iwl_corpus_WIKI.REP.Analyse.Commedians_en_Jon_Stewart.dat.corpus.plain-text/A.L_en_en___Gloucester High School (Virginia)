'''Gloucester High School''' is a fully accredited public high school located four miles from [[Gloucester Courthouse, Virginia|Gloucester Courthouse]] (the [[county seat]]) in [[Gloucester County, Virginia]], [[USA]]. It is operated by [[Gloucester County Public Schools]], a [[Virginia]] public [[school division]].

The current complex was originally built in 1976, and has been expanded several times since. The high school was formerly located at the former Page Middle School building, which used to house the sixth to eighth graders until 2011 when a tornado partially destroyed the middle school- and by "partially destroyed" we mean "took that bish out completely."  The current high school facility remains the only high school in the county, even though student numbers have risen steadily since its construction date. the current amount of students ranges somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000.

==Renovations==
A major addition was built onto the school in 1993 and functions mainly as the school's science wing and is fully equipped with 3 computer labs, 2 full scale chemistry labs, as well as other classrooms with enough equipment for simple demonstrations. It is known to students and faculty as D-Hall. Also included in the expansion was a foreign language hall at the opposite end of the building, built onto A-Hall. Less extensive renovations have occurred since then, including the office and guidance offices in 2005. Beginning in April 2006, the industrial arts facilities were remodeled into new art rooms by the beginning of the following school year, freeing up the previous art rooms for normal classroom use.  The old primary art room became the newsroom of the school newspaper, the ''Dukes' Dispatch''. During the summer of 2006, the school's television production facility was updated with new equipment and made into a studio. The school then began producing programming for its own local  [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel. The most recent renovations were completed in October 2006, and included a $700,000 renovation of the school's auditorium. 

During the summer of 2007, Gloucester High began outfitting classrooms with [[LCD projectors]]. Most recently, another wing of the school began renovations to add a cardiovascular workout room. The room will include [[treadmill]]s and other cardiovascular workout machines.

==Class structure==
Gloucester High School operates on an A-Day B-Day block scheduling structure. The school day begins at 7:55 am EDT and ends at 2:30 pm EDT. Every day there are three classes just over 90 minutes in length and one class 55 minutes in length. The 55-minute class meets every day. The following day will contain three other 90-minute classes and the 53-minute class, totaling in seven classes. There are three lunch blocks, each 25 minutes in length, which take place in third block.<ref>http://ghs.gc.k12.va.us/bell_lunch_sched_09-10.pdf</ref>
