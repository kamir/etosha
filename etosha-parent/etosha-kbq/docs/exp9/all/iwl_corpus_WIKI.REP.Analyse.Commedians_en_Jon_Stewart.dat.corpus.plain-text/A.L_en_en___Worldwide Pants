'''Worldwide Pants Inc.''' is an American television and film production company owned by comedian and talk show host [[David Letterman]]. Its ongoing productions are ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (since 1993) and ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS)|The Late Late Show]]'' (since 1995).

The company is headquartered at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] building in [[New York City]]. The President and [[CEO]] is former ''Late Show'' executive producer [[Rob Burnett (producer)|Rob Burnett]]. [[Peter Lassally]], a former ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''Late Show'' executive producer, is the senior vice-president; he is also the current ''Late Late Show'' executive producer.

==History==
===1990s===
{{expand section|date=October 2012}}
A predecessor company, ''Space Age Meats'', produced Letterman's first television talk show, ''[[The David Letterman Show]]''.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

The first Worldwide Pants production was ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', produced in partnership with NBC and [[Carson Productions]]. The company, then known as '''Worldwide Pants Productions''', shared a [[List of Peabody Award winners (1990–1999)#1991|1991]] [[Peabody Award]], for their ability to "take one of TV's most conventional and least inventive forms—the talk show—and infuse it with freshness and imagination."<ref>[http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/details.php?id=49 1991 Peabody Award to ''Late Night with David Letterman''] from the [[Peabody Award]] website</ref>

===2002–2006===
A 2002 ''[[Forbes]]'' article comments on the approach Letterman takes for Worldwide Pants television productions:<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0708/136_print.html Celebrity 100 article about Letterman and Worldwide Pants], from a July 2002 ''[[Forbes]] article</ref>
:Letterman's approach is to nurture an idea with seed money from his production company, then get someone else to pay for the rest of it. He isn't particularly hands-on once the programs get past the initial stages, but his imprimatur carries weight with network buyers. "They've got a point of view about everything they do," says [[Chris Albrecht]], president of original programming at HBO. "These guys are making television every night and have been for a long time. You feel more comfortable with them."

The company produced its first film, ''[[Strangers with Candy (film)|Strangers with Candy]]'', a prequel to the TV show [[Strangers with Candy|of the same name]]. The film premiered at the [[2005 in film|2005]] [[Sundance Film Festival]], within the "[[Park City, Utah|Park City]] at Midnight" category. [[Warner Independent Pictures]] subsequently signed up as North American distributor of the film, before [[ThinkFilm]] acquired the rights from Warner, giving it a limited release in summer 2006. The film grossed slightly more than $2 million, on a $2 million production budget and $1.5 million prints and advertising budget.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/STRWC.php Strangers with Candy] from The Numbers</ref>

In April 2005 the [[Sci Fi Channel]] announced that Worldwide Pants would produce a half-hour animated ensemble comedy for the channel from [[Brendon Small]], called ''[[Barbarian Chronicles]]''. A subsequent interview with Small confirmed there were no plans to go through with the deal.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/brendon_small.aspx| title=Brendon Small interview | publication-date=7 April 2008 |date=Fall 2007 | publisher =lambgoat.com}}</ref>

===2007 WGA strike===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
Production of new episodes of the company's two late-night CBS talk shows ceased on November 5, 2007 when the Worldwide Pants writers joined the strike against the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP), the [[trade association]] of which Worldwide Pants is a member.

During the first part of the strike reruns of Worldwide Pants shows were aired. This changed when Worldwide Pants broke ranks with the AMPTP by negotiating an independent, interim [[collective bargaining agreement]] with the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writers Guild of America]] in which Worldwide Pants essentially agreed to operate in accordance with the contract demands of the WGA for the duration of the labor dispute. The agreements automatically reverted to the final contract terms that the guild reached with the AMPTP at the end of the strike. The agreement allowed both the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' to return to the airwaves with their full writing staffs on January 2, 2008.

The agreement gave Worldwide Pants and CBS a perceived advantage over their rivals at [[NBC]]. The latter network was unable to make similar arrangements for its late night programming because NBC had retained control of production operations for both ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]].'' Unlike CBS, NBC would have had to negotiate an agreement covering the entire network in order to have writers work on the two late night shows. NBC aired new episodes of its late night shows on the same night as CBS, but without writers. This meant, among other things, that Leno and O'Brien were unable to perform their traditional [[monologue]]s without violating strike rules (as the WGA had determined Leno previously did with monologues he claimed to have written) and were unable to secure the appearance of most celebrities, who refused to cross a [[picketing (protest)|picket line]].{{cn|date=October 2012}}

===2007–present===
In October 2007, the media announced that Worldwide Pants would co-produce its first non-comedy project, a documentary about young adults running for public office.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974916.html Documentary fits Worldwide Pants] from ''[[Variety (magazine)]]'' magazine</ref>  The documentary, titled ''[[The Youngest Candidate]]'', was written and directed by [[Jason Pollock]] and premiered July 2008 at the [[Traverse City Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1133997/releaseinfo Release dates for ''The Youngest Candidate''] from the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref>

In March 2008, [[EcoMedia]] announced a "content partnership" with Worldwide Pants to "create original, unscripted, environment-related content, in the style of ''The Late Show'' remote segments, for television and Internet distribution."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS140902+07-Mar-2008+PRN20080307| title=EcoMedia and Worldwide Pants Incorporated Announce Content Partnership| work=EcoMedia press release| publisher=[[Reuters]]| date=7 March 2008}}</ref>

In 2008 Worldwide Pants signed a product placement deal with [[Ford]] to promote the [[Ford Flex]] during ''The Late Late Show'', using a series of weekly custom-written skits in which Ferguson played the leader of a band riding in a Flex as they traveled from [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to the CBS Studio.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS172059+03-Sep-2008+PRN20080903| title=Innovative Marketing Campaign Puts Ford Flex in Front of Millions of Potential Customers| date=2008-09-03| accessdate=2008-10-10| publisher=[[Reuters]]| work=Ford [[press release]]}}</ref>

In April 2010, Worldwide Pants started [[Clear Entertainment]], a.k.a. [[C.E. Music]], a [[record label]] and announced the signing of their first band [[Runner Runner (band)|Runner Runner]], a pop-punk group from [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[California]].<ref> {{cite web | url= http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/04/28/david-letterman-runner-band/ | title= David Letterman starts record label, signs pop-punk band | author= Simon Vozick-Levinson | date=April 28, 2010| work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>

In April 2012, CBS announced that it would begin co-producing ''The Late Late Show'' with Worldwide Pants, part of a deal that included extending Ferguson's contract until 2014.<ref name="2014coprod">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=871 |title=CBS ANNOUNCES New Contract Extension with Late Night Stars David Letterman and Craig Ferguson through 2014 |publisher=CBS Corporation |work= Press release|date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}</ref>

In October 2012, Worldwide Pants and B&B Productions—a subsidiary of Worldwide Pants created by [[Rob Burnett (producer)|Rob Burnett]] and [[Jon Beckerman]]—announced they had secured the rights to adapt [[Jonathan Evison]]'s novel ''[[The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving]]'' as [[The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving (film)|a feature film]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/worldwide-pants-nabs-big-screen-378278 | title= Worldwide Pants Nabs Big-Screen Rights to Jonathan Evison's Novel ''The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving''| date=October 11, 2012 | author= Tatiana Siegel | publisher= [[Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=2012-10-23}}</ref>
