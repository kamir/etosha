In eighth grade, Cavett directed a live Saturday-morning radio show sponsored by the [[Junior League]] and played the title role in ''[[The Winslow Boy]]''. One of his high-school classmates was actress [[Sandy Dennis]]. Cavett was elected state president of the student council in high school, and was a gold medalist at the state [[gymnastics]] championship.<ref name="slate1"/><ref name="pbs2">

Before leaving for college, he worked as a [[caddy]] at the Lincoln Country Club. He also began performing [[illusionist|magic shows]] for $35 a night under the tutelage of Gene Gloye. In 1952, Cavett attended the convention of the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and won the Best New Performer trophy.<ref name="pbs2"/> Around the same time, he met fellow magician [[Johnny Carson]], 11 years his senior, who was doing a magic act at a church in Lincoln.<ref name="nba1">{{Cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/lifepart2/perspectives/dick-cavett-0 | title = Nebraska Broadcasters Association, Hall of Fame 1991 | accessdate=2010-02-14}}</ref>

==Marriages==
[[File:Carrie Nye 1961.JPG|right|thumb|130px|[[Carrie Nye]]]]
While taking a class at [[Yale School of Drama]] as an [[Undergraduate education#United States system|undergraduate]], Cavett met his future wife, Caroline Nye McGeoy (known professionally as [[Carrie Nye]]), a native of [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. After graduation, the two acted in summer theater in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]]; and Cavett worked for two weeks in a local lumberyard to be able to buy an engagement ring. On June 4, 1964, they were married in New York. Their marriage was at times tumultuous; but they remained married until Nye's death on July 14, 2006.

In 2010, Cavett married business author Martha Rogers, [[Ph.D.]], in a small ceremony in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/nyregion/14spotli.html |title=This Time, Cavett Answers the Questions |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2011-04-10 |first=Karin |last=Lipson}}</ref>

==''The Tonight Show''==
In 1960, Cavett was living in a three-room, fifth-floor [[wikt:walk-up|walk-up]] on West 89th Street in [[Manhattan]] for $51 a month.

He was cast in a film by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], but further jobs were not forthcoming. He was an extra on ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' in 1959, a TV remake of the film ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' for the ''[[DuPont Show of the Month]]'' the same year, and ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' ("The Hiding Place") in 1960. He briefly revived his magic act while working as a typist and as a [[mystery shopper]] in department stores. Meanwhile, Nye landed several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] roles.

Cavett was a copyboy ([[gofer]]) at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref name="NYObserver1">
{{Cite news | url = http://www.observer.com/node/43531 | accessdate = 2010-02-13 | title = Dick Cavett Moonwalks From Past With Rocky Horror Broadway Gig  | first=Andrew | last = Goldman | date = 2000-10-22 | newspaper = The New York Observer}}</ref> when he read a newspaper item about [[Jack Paar]], then host of ''[[The Tonight Show]].'' The article described Paar's concerns about his opening monologue and constant search for material. Cavett wrote some jokes, put them into a ''Time'' envelope, and went to the [[GE Building|RCA Building]]. He ran into Paar in a hallway and handed him the envelope.<ref name="NYObserver1"/> He then went to sit in the studio audience. During the show, Paar worked in some of the lines Cavett had fed him.<ref name="NYObserver1"/> Afterward, Cavett got into an elevator with Paar, who invited him to contribute more jokes. Within weeks, Cavett was hired, originally as [[talent coordinator]]. Cavett wrote for Paar the famous line "Here they are, [[Jayne Mansfield in popular culture#Physical assets|Jayne Mansfield]]," as an introduction for the buxom actress.<ref name="time1">

[[File:Dick Cavett Alan King Johnny Carson Friars Club Carson roast 1968.JPG|thumb|right|Cavett, [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]] and [[Johnny Carson]] in 1968]]
While at ''Time,'' Cavett wrote a letter to [[Stan Laurel]]. The two later met at Laurel's apartment in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Later the same day, Cavett wrote a tribute that Paar read on the show, which Laurel saw and appreciated. Cavett visited Laurel a few more times, up to three weeks before Laurel's death.

In his capacity as talent coordinator for ''The Tonight Show'', Cavett was sent to the Blue Angel nightclub to see [[Woody Allen]]'s act, and immediately afterward struck up a friendship. The very next day, the funeral of playwright [[George S. Kaufman]] was held at the [[Frank E. Campbell funeral home]]. Allen could not attend, but Cavett did, where he met [[Groucho Marx]] in an anteroom. From the funeral, Cavett followed Marx (who later told Cavett that Kaufman was "his personal god") three blocks up Fifth Avenue to the [[Plaza Hotel]], where Marx invited him to lunch.<ref name="NYObserver1"/> Years later, Cavett gave the introduction to Marx's one-man show, ''An Evening with Groucho Marx'' at [[Carnegie Hall]], and began by saying, "I can't believe that I know Groucho Marx."<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/marx.htm | accessdate = 2010-02-14 | title = An Evening with Groucho Marx: Transcript}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://tennesseebillsotr.com/otr/An%20Evening%20With%20Groucho%20Marx(OTRR%20Certified)%20(47.5MB)/ | accessdate = 2010-02-14 | title = An Evening with Groucho Marx: OTRR Recording}}</ref>

Cavett continued with ''The Tonight Show'' as a writer after [[Johnny Carson]] assumed hosting duties. For Carson he wrote the line "Having your taste criticized by [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] is like having your clothes criticized by [[Emmett Kelly]]." He even appeared on the show once, to do a [[gymnastics]] routine on the [[pommel horse]]. After departing ''The Tonight Show'', Cavett wrote for [[Jerry Lewis]]'s ill-fated talk show, for three times the money{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. He returned to ''The Tonight Show'', however, when Marx was interim host for Carson in July 1964.

==Stand-up comic==
Cavett began a brief career as a [[stand-up comic]] in 1964 at [[the Bitter End]] in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="NewYorker1"/> His manager was [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who later became the producer of nearly all of [[Woody Allen]]'s films.

His most famous line from this period may have been the following:
{{quote|I went to a [[China|Chinese]]-[[Germany|German]] restaurant. The food is great, but an hour later you're hungry for power.<ref name="NYObserver1"/><ref name="time1"/><ref name="NewYorker1"/>}}

He also played Mr. Kelly's in [[Chicago]] and the [[Hungry i]] in [[San Francisco]]. In San Francisco, he met [[Lenny Bruce]], about whom he said:
{{quote|I liked him and wish I had known him better...but most of what has been written about him is a waste of good ink, and his most zealous adherents and hardest-core devotees are to be avoided, even if it means working your way around the world in the hold of a goat transport.<ref name="lennygoat">{{ Citation | last1 = Cavett| first1=Dick| last2=Porterfield| first2=Christopher| title=Cavett| publisher=Bantam Books | year = 1975| pages=222–223.}}</ref>}}

In 1965 Cavett did some commercial voiceovers, including a series of mock interviews with [[Mel Brooks]] for [[Ballantine Brewery|Ballantine beer]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/ballantine_ale.htm| title=Ballantine Ale| accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> In the next couple of years he appeared on [[game show]]s, including ''[[What's My Line]]''. He wrote for [[Merv Griffin]] and appeared on Griffin's talk show several times, and then on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. In the late 1960s or early 70s, he narrated a [[National Association of Broadcasters]] PSA featuring A Boy Wandering Around A Forest.

In 1968, after the premiere of the international film ''[[Candy (1968 film)|Candy]]'', Cavett went to a party at the Americana Hotel, where those who had just seen the film were being interviewed for TV.

{{quote|When the interviewer, [[Pat Paulsen]], got to me, he asked what I thought the critics would say about ''Candy''. I said I didn't think it would be reviewed by the regular critics, that they would have to reconvene the [[Nuremberg Trials]] to do it justice. He laughed and asked what I had liked, and I said I liked the lady who showed me the nearest exit so that I would not be forced to vomit indoors.}}

After doing ''The Star and the Story'', a rejected [[television pilot]] with [[Van Johnson]], Cavett hosted a special, ''Where It's At'', for [[Bud Yorkin]] and [[Norman Lear]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b3MhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q4gFAAAAIBAJ&dq=where%20it's%20at%20bud%20yorkin%20and%20norman%20lear%20cavett&pg=2313%2C1523310|accessdate=2010-02-17 | newspaper = Schenectady Gazette| date=1966-10-07}}</ref>

In 1968 Cavett was hired by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to host ''This Morning''.<ref name="NewYorker1">{{Cite news| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZckBAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=Dick Cavett Tries and Tries Again| first=David|last=Blum|newspaper=The New Yorker| date=1985-10-07| accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref name="biocom1"/> According to a ''New Yorker'' article, the show was too sophisticated for a morning audience,<ref name="NewYorker1"/> and ABC first moved the show to prime time, and subsequently to a late-night slot opposite Johnny Carson's ''The Tonight Show''.<ref name="NewYorker1"/><ref name="time2">

Cavett once related an anecdote that he and Marlon Brando were having dinner at a restaurant when a female fan approached the two men and made an advance. The men almost partook in a threesome with the fan, but Dick decided against it because they hadn't finished their soup.

His most popular talk show was his [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program, which ran from 1969 to 1974. From 1962 to 1992, ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' was arguably the most popular of late night variety and talk shows.

Clips from his TV shows (actual or enacted for the occasion) have been used in films, for example ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' (1995), and ''[[Frequency (film)|Frequency]]'' (2000). He also holds the distinction of being the only famous person to actually interact with the title character of ''Forrest Gump'' without the aid of archive footage or computer trickery.

Kline prescribed [[antidepressant]] medication, which according to Cavett was successful in treating his depression.<ref name="People-1992"/>

In 1980 Cavett suffered what he characterized as his "biggest depressive episode." While on board a [[Concorde]] prior to take off, Cavett broke out into a sweat and became agitated. After he was removed from the plane, Cavett was taken to [[New York–Presbyterian Hospital|Columbia Presbyterian Hospital]] in New York City, where he later underwent [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Regarding this method of treatment, Cavett is quoted as saying, "In my case, ECT was miraculous. My wife was dubious, but when she came into my room afterward, I sat up and said, 'Look who's back among the living.' It was like a magic wand."<ref name="People-1992">

<!-- I'm commenting this out for the time being as I cannot find any references from reliable sources of any contraversy—there are a lot of blogs and comments on cavett's page itself, but I don't think that qualifies as media. Nuujinn, 2010-02-17
The blog includes video excerpts from ''The Dick Cavett Show''. On July 25, 2007, Cavett's blog included his thoughts on overweight Americans, which was widely reported in the media.<ref>[http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/is-bigger-really-better/ Is Bigger Really Better?]</ref>

In 2008 Cavett entered an Iraq war dispute with a ''New York Times'' blog entry criticizing General [[David Petraeus]], stating "I can't look at Petraeus—his uniform ornamented like a Christmas tree with honors, medals, and ribbons—without thinking of the great [[Mort Sahl]] at the peak of his brilliance." Cavett went on to recall Sahl's expressed contempt of [[William Childs Westmoreland|General Westmoreland's]] display of medals, and criticized Petraeus for not speaking in plain language.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/memo-to-petraeus-crocker-more-laughs-please/#comments | work=The New York Times | title=Memo to Petraeus and Crocker: More Laughs, Please | first=Dick | last=Cavett | date=2008-04-11 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>

In December 2012, for their annual birthday celebration to "The Master," ''[[The Noel Coward Society]]'' invited Cavett as the guest celebrity to lay flowers in front of Coward's statue at New York's ''[[Gershwin Theatre]]'', commemorating the 113th birthday of Sir Noel.

Hellman later sued McCarthy for libel. The suit spanned more than four years.
