'''Ellen Johnson Sirleaf''' (born 29 October 1938) is the [[President of Liberia#List of Presidents of Liberia|24th and current]] [[President of Liberia|President]] of [[Liberia]]. She served as Minister of Finance under President [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.|William Tolbert]] from 1979 until the 1980 [[coup d'état]], after which she left Liberia and held senior positions at various financial institutions. She placed second in the [[Liberian presidential election, 1997|1997 presidential election]] won by [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]. She won the [[Liberian general election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] and took office on 16 January 2006, and she was a successful candidate for [[Liberian general election, 2011|re-election in 2011]]. Sirleaf is the first elected female [[head of state]] in Africa.

Sirleaf was awarded the 2011 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], jointly with [[Leymah Gbowee]] of Liberia and [[Tawakel Karman]] of [[Yemen]]. The women were recognized "for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work."<ref name="nobel">{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2011/press.html |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2011&nbsp;– Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Sirleaf was born in [[Monrovia]],<ref name=harv>{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/ksgpress/bulletin/spring2006/features/ellen.htm |title=Ellen! |publisher=[[Harvard University]] [[Kennedy School of Government]] |date=Spring 2006}}</ref> and attended the [[College of West Africa]] from 1948 - 1955. She married James Sirleaf when she was 17 years old,<ref name=brit /> and then traveled with him to the United States in 1961 to continue her studies and earned an associate degree in accounting at [[Madison Business College]], in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name="bergner">{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Bergner |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24sirleaf-t.html |title=An Uncompromising Woman |work=[[New York Times Magazine]] |date=22 October 2010}}</ref> Sirleaf did not have a bachelor's degree, so in 1970 she enrolled at the Economics Institute in [[Boulder, Colorado]], where she spent the summer preparing for graduate studies. Sirleaf studied economics and public policy at Harvard's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] from 1969 to 1971, gaining a [[Master of Public Administration]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} She then returned to her native Liberia to work under the government of [[William Tolbert]], where she became the Assistant Minister of Finance.  While in that position, she attracted attention with a "bombshell" speech to the Liberian Chamber of Commerce that claimed that the country's corporations were harming the economy by hoarding or sending overseas their profits.<ref>Robinson, Jack.  "Mrs. Sirleaf on 'Stimulating the Economy'".  ''Liberian Age'', 1973-06-29, 1–2.</ref>

Sirleaf served as assistant minister from 1972 to 1973 under Tolbert's administration. She resigned after getting into a disagreement about spending. Subsequently she was Minister of Finance from 1979 to April 1980. Master Sergeant [[Samuel Doe]], a member of the indigenous [[Krahn]] ethnic group, seized power in an 12 April 1980 [[military coup]]; Tolbert was assassinated and all but four members of his cabinet were executed by firing squad. The [[People's Redemption Council]] took control of the country and led a purge against the former government. Sirleaf initially accepted a post in the new government as President of the [[Liberian Bank for Development and Investment]], though she fled the country in November 1980 after publicly criticizing Doe and the People's Redemption Council for their management of the country.

Sirleaf initially moved to Washington, D.C., to work for the [[World Bank]] before moving to [[Nairobi]] in 1981 to serve as Vice President of the African Regional Office of [[Citibank]]. She resigned from Citibank in 1985 following her involvement in the [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 election]] in Liberia and went to work for Equator Bank, a subsidiary of [[HSBC]]. In 1992, Sirleaf was appointed as the Director of the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Bureau for Africa at the rank of Assistant Administrator and Assistant Secretary General (ASG), from which she resigned in 1997 to run for president in Liberia. During her time at the UN, she was one of the seven internationally eminent persons designated in 1999 by the [[Organization of African Unity]] to investigate the [[Rwandan genocide]], one of the five Commission Chairs for the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and one of two international experts selected by [[UNIFEM]] to investigate and report on the effect of conflict on women and women's roles in peace building. She was the initial Chairperson of the [[Open Society Initiative for West Africa]] (OSIWA) and a visiting Professor of Governance at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA).

==Political career==

===1985 general election===

While working at Citibank, Sirleaf returned to Liberia in 1985 to run for [[Vice President of Liberia|Vice President]] under [[Jackson Doe]] on the ticket of the [[Liberian Action Party]] in the [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 elections]]. However, Sirleaf was placed under [[house arrest]] in August of that year and soon after sentenced to ten years in prison for [[sedition]] as a consequence of a speech in which she insulted the members of the Doe regime. Following international calls for her release, Doe pardoned and released her in September. Due to government pressure, she was removed from the presidential ticket and instead ran for a [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]] seat in [[Montserrado County]].

Though the elections, which saw Doe and the [[National Democratic Party of Liberia|National Democratic Party]] win the presidency and large majorities in both houses, were widely condemned as neither free nor fair, Sirleaf was declared the winner of her Senate race. Sirleaf refused to accept the seat in protest of the election fraud. After an attempted coup against the Doe government by [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]] on 12 November, Sirleaf was arrested and imprisoned again on 13 November by Doe's forces. Despite continuing to refuse to accept her seat in the Senate, she was released in July 1986 and secretly fled the country to the United States later that year.

===1997 presidential campaign===
[[File:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf 2005.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Sirleaf campaigning in Monrovia in 2005, shortly before she was elected.]]

At the beginning of the [[First Liberian Civil War]] in 1989, Sirleaf supported [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s rebellion against Doe, helping raise money for the war and found the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] with Taylor and [[Tom Woewiyu]]. Because of this Sirleaf was later recommended a 30-year ban from politics. However, she later opposed Taylor's handling of the war and his treatment of rival opposition leaders such as [[Jackson Doe]]. By 1996, the presence of [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) peacekeepers led to a cessation of hostilities, resulting in the [[Liberian general election, 1997|1997 general election]], which Sirleaf returned to Liberia to contest. Now running as the presidential candidate for the [[Unity Party (Liberia)|Unity Party]], she placed second in a controversial election, getting 25% of the vote to Charles Taylor's 75%. Sirleaf left the country soon after and again went into exile in [[Abidjan]].

===2005 presidential campaign===

After the end of the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] and the establishment of a transitional government, Sirleaf was proposed as a possible candidate for chairman of the government. Ultimately, [[Gyude Bryant]], a political neutral, was chosen as chairman, while Sirleaf served as head of the Governance Reform Commission.

Sirleaf once again stood for president as the candidate of the Unity Party in the [[Liberian general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. She placed second in the first round of voting behind [[association football|footballer]] [[George Weah]]. In the subsequent run-off election, Sirleaf earned 59% of the vote versus 40% for Weah, though Weah disputed the results. The announcement of the new leader was postponed until further investigations were carried out. On 23 November 2005, Sirleaf was declared the winner of the Liberian election and confirmed as the country's next president.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/nov/23/davidfickling?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Johnson-Sirleaf declared Liberian president|last=Fickling|first=David|date=23 November 2005|work=The Guardian |accessdate=22 November 2011|location=London}}</ref> Her inauguration, attended by many foreign dignitaries, including [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]], took place on 16 January 2006.

===2011 presidential campaign===

In January 2010, Sirleaf announced that she would run for a second term in office in the [[Liberian general election, 2011|2011 presidential election]] while speaking to a joint session of the Legislature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8480344.stm|title=Liberia President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to stand again|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=26 January 2010|work=[[BBC News]]  }}</ref> Opposition leaders noted that in doing so, she had broken a promise made during her 2005 campaign to only serve one term if elected.<ref>{{cite web | first=Joshua E. | last=Keating | url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/19/the_men_who_would_be_queen | title=The Men Who Would Be Queen | work=[[Foreign Policy]] | date=19 August 2011 | accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> Sirleaf was renominated as the Unity Party's presidential candidate at the party's national convention on 31 October 2010.<ref name=Secterm>{{cite news|first=Varney|last=Kamara|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201011010544.html|title=Sirleaf, Boakai Get Sec-Term Mandate|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=1 November 2010|work=[[allAfrica.com]]}}</ref> That same day, Vice President [[Joseph Boakai]] was nominated by Sirleaf and confirmed by the delegates as Sirleaf's running mate.<ref name=Secterm/>

The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Sirleaf four days prior to the election sparked criticism from opposition parties, with [[Congress for Democratic Change]] candidate [[Winston Tubman]] calling the award "undeserved" and "a political interference in our country's politics."<ref>{{cite news | first=Tamasin | last=Ford | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/09/ellen-johnson-siraf-nobel-liberia?newsfeed=true | title=Ellen Johnson Sirleaf faces a tough presidential election in Liberia |work=The Guardian  | date=9 October 2011 | accessdate=10 October 2012 | location=London}}</ref> Sirleaf called the timing of the award a coincidence and avoided mentioning the award during the final days of campaigning.<ref>{{cite news | first=Adam | last=Nossiter | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/world/africa/on-the-campaign-trail-liberias-sirleaf-plays-down-nobel-win.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=liberia%20sirleaf%20election&st=cse | title=Nobel Winner Doesn’t Want to Talk About It on the Campaign Trail | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=9 October 2011 | accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>

Sirleaf garnered 43.9% of the vote in the first round, more than any other candidate but short of the 50% needed to avoid a run-off.

==Presidency==

===Domestic policy===
[[File:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf3.jpg|thumb|right|Sirleaf at her inauguration in Monrovia.]]

A fire broke out at the Executive Mansion on 26 July 2006, seriously damaging the structure. An independent panel formed to investigate the incident ruled out arson, attributing the fire to an electrical malfunction.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/a-13-2006-09-04-voa23.html | title = In Liberia, Report on Executive Mansion Fire Rules Out Arson | work=[[Voice of America]] | date = 4 September  2006}}</ref> Sirleaf's government called funding for the repair of the mansion a low priority in the face of more pressing needs, with Sirleaf transferring her office to the nearby Foreign Ministry building and choosing to live at her personal home in Monrovia.<ref>{{cite news | first = Nathaniel | last = Daygbor | url = http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1552:mansions-renovation-not-priority&catid=25:politics&Itemid=59 | title = Mansion's Renovation Not Priority | newspaper=The New Dawn | date = 20 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Glenna|last=Gordon|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/africa/090818/liberias-squatters-monrovia|title=Inside Liberia's Other Executive Mansion|newspaper=[[GlobalPost]]|date=19 August 2009}}</ref>

On 26 July 2007, Sirleaf celebrated Liberia's 160th Independence Day under the theme "Liberia at 160: Reclaiming the future." She took an unprecedented and symbolic move by asking 25-year-old Liberian activist [[Kimmie Weeks]] to serve as National Orator for the celebrations, where Weeks called for the government to prioritize education and health care. A few days later, President Sirleaf issued an Executive Order making education free and compulsory for all elementary school aged children.

In October 2010, Sirleaf signed into law a [[Freedom of information legislation|Freedom of Information bill]], the first legislation of its kind in West Africa.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201010070050.html | title = Liberia: President Signs Freedom of Information Law | newspaper=[[allAfrica.com]] | date = 6 October 2010}}</ref> In recognition of this, she became the first sitting head of state to receive the Friend of the Media in Africa Award from The African Editor's Union.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201010200893.html | title = Sirleaf Sets Continental Record | work=allAfrica.com | date = 20 October 2010}}</ref>

On 1 April  2011, Sirleaf told reporters that she planned to charge an opposition candidate with [[sedition]] for organizing a rally protesting corruption in the government. Her press secretary later clarified that the remark had been an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools' prank]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newdemocratnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=592:the-presidents-april-fool&catid=47:national&Itemid=70 |title = The President's 'April Fool' |  work=New Democrat | date = 5 April 2011}}</ref>

====Debt relief====

From the beginning of her presidency, Sirleaf vowed to make reduction of the [[national debt]], which stood at approximately US$4.9&nbsp;billion in 2006, a top priority for her administration. The United States became the first country to grant debt relief to Liberia, waiving the full $391&nbsp;million owed to it by Liberia in early 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200702160283.html |title = Liberia: Pres. Johnson-Sirleaf Returns Triumphantly | newspaper=Africa News | date = 16 February 2007}}</ref> In September of that year, the [[G8|G-8]] headed by German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] provided $324.5&nbsp;million to paying off 60% of Liberia's debt to the [[International Monetary Fund]], crediting their decision to the macroeconomic policies pursued by the Sirleaf administration.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200709250326.html |title = Liberia: G-8 Rallies for Country's Debts | newspaper=Africa News | date = 24 September 2007}}</ref>

In April 2009, the government successfully wrote off an additional $1.2&nbsp;billion in foreign [[debt|commercial debt]] in a deal that saw the government buy back the debt at a 97% discounted rate through financing provided by the [[International Development Association]], Germany, [[Norway]], the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name=Slash>{{cite press release| url=http://www.emansion.gov.lr/press.php?news_id=1143 |title = Liberia Slashes USD$1.2&nbsp;Billion Commercial Debt | publisher=The Executive Mansion |location=Monrovia |date = 16 April  2009 |accessdate=14 December  2010}}</ref> The discounted rate was the largest ever for a developing country.<ref name=Slash/>

The country was deemed eligible to participate in the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] initiative in 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE61F0G020100216 | title = Liberia on track for HIPC debt relief this year: IMF | newspaper=Reuters Africa | date = 16 February  2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> In June 2010, the country reached the completion point of the HIPC initiative, qualifying it for relief from its entire external debt.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.liberianobserver.com/node/6692 | first=George |last=Kennedy |title = Liberia Reaches HIPC Completion Point | newspaper=The Liberian Observer | date = 2 June 2010}}</ref> That same month, the World Bank and IMF agreed to fund $1.5&nbsp;billion in writing off the Liberia's multilateral debt.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201006291216.html | title = Liberia: IMF and World Bank Announce U.S.$4.6&nbsp;Billion Debt Relief | newspaper=AllAfrica.com | date = 29 June 2010}}</ref> On 16 September, the [[Paris Club]] agreed to cancel $1.26&nbsp;billion, with independent bilateral creditors canceling an additional $107&nbsp;million, essentially writing off Liberia's remaining external debt.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201009170015.html | title = Liberia: Paris Club Clears More Than U.S.$1&nbsp;Billion Debt Liberia Owes Its Creditors | newspaper=AllAfrica.com | date = 16 September 2010}}</ref> Sirleaf vowed to prevent unsustainable borrowing in the future by restricting annual borrowing to 3% of GDP and limiting expenditure of all borrowed funds to one-off infrastructure projects.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE66I0CW20100719 | first=Alphonso |last=Toweh |title = Liberia ready to borrow again: finance minister | newspaper=Reuters Africa | date = 19 July 2010}}</ref>

====Truth and Reconciliation Commission====
[[File:Ellen Johnson Sirleaf gc2008.jpg|thumb|200px|left|President Sirleaf addressing the 2008 General Conference of the [[United Methodist Church]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].]]

In 2006, Sirleaf established a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Liberia)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] with a mandate to "promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation" by investigating more than 20 years of civil conflict in the country.

In their final report, issued in June 2009, the TRC included Sirleaf in a list of 50 names of people that should be "specifically barred from holding public offices; elected or appointed for a period of thirty (30) years" for "being associated with former warring factions."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joAaW2DuzNDfyi8t7h4X594XcHCg |title=Sirleaf should be banned from office: Liberia truth commission |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> The proposed ban stemmed from her financial support of former President Taylor in the initial months of the First Liberian Civil War.

On 26 July 2009, Sirleaf apologized to Liberia for supporting Charles Taylor, saying: "When the true nature of Mr. Taylor's intentions became known, there was no more impassioned critic or strong opponent to him in a democratic process" than she.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Gettleman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/world/africa/14diplo.html?hpw |title=Clinton Supports President of Liberia |work=New York Times |date=13 August 2009}}</ref> On 28 August, the Legislature announced they must "consult our constituents for about a year" before deciding whether or not to implement the Commission's recommendations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ansu |last=Konneh |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&sid=aIqClsvAY9T0 |title=Liberian Parliament Delay Action on Truth Commission Findings |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=28 August 2010}}</ref>

During an appearance at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in 2010, Sirleaf argued that the implementation of the TRC's recommended ban would unconstitutionally violate her right to [[due process]].<ref name=CFR>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/22222/conversation_with_ellen_johnson_sirleaf_president_republic_of_liberia.html |title=A Conversation with Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President, Republic of Liberia |date=25 May 2010 |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]}}</ref> In October 2010, the chairman of Sirleaf's Unity Party, [[Varney Sherman]], argued that implementation of the recommendation would be unconstitutional, as Article 21(a) of the Constitution prohibits ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws, and Sirleaf had broken no law by financially supporting Taylor that imposed a ban from public office as a penalty.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rodney |last=Sieh |url=http://www.frontpageafrica.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=11600&z=2 |title=Interview: Varney Sherman on New UP Pickups Saga; Re-Electing Ellen |date=7 October 2010 |work=FrontPageAfrica}}</ref>

In January 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Liberia|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Williams v. Tah'', a case brought by another person recommended for being banned from public office in the TRC report, that the TRC's recommendation was an unconstitutional violation of the listed individuals' right to [[procedural due process]], and that it would be unconstitutional for the government to implement the proposed bans.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.netnewspublisher.com/liberian-supreme-court-squashes-truth-and-reconciliation-commission-ban-on-politicians/ | title = Liberian Supreme Court Squashes Truth And Reconciliation Commission Ban on Politicians | newspaper=NetNewsPublisher | date = 24 January 2011}}</ref>

====Gay rights====

Following a speech made by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in December 2011 that America's foreign aid would be used to promote the protection of gay rights,<ref name="Guardian - homosexuality">{{cite news | first1=Tamasin | last1=Ford | first2=Bonnie | last2=Allen | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/19/nobel-peace-prize-law-homosexuality | title=Nobel peace prize winner defends law criminalising homosexuality in Liberia | newspaper=The Guardian | date=19 March 2012 | accessdate=9 October 2012 | location=London}}</ref> the issue of [[LGBT rights in Liberia|LGBT rights]] became a significant political topic in Liberia. According to ''[[Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]'', "Since Clinton's remarks, Liberian newspapers have published numerous articles and editorials describing homosexuality as 'desecrating', 'abusive' and an 'abomination'."<ref name="Guardian - homosexuality"/> Liberian law made "[[Sodomy|voluntary sodomy]]" punishable by up to one year in prison, although it has not been used to prosecute anyone in several years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154354.htm | title=2010 Human Rights Report: Liberia | work=United States Department of State | date=8 April 2011 | accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>

In February 2012, [[Bong County]] Senator [[Jewel Taylor]] proposed a bill that would carry a term of ten years in prison for homosexual activity, while a similar bill was introduced in the [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]].<ref name="Guardian - homosexuality"/> On 19 March, Sirleaf addressed the issue, saying that she would not repeal the current law but would also not sign into law either of the two proposed bills. Sirleaf added, "We like ourselves just the way we are [...] We've got certain traditional values in our society that we would like to preserve."<ref name="Guardian - homosexuality"/> According to Tiawan Gongloe, Liberia's former Solicitor General, "If she tried to decriminalise the [current anti-gay] law it would be political suicide."<ref name="Guardian - homosexuality"/>

In a letter to ''The Guardian,'' Sirleaf's press secretary challenged the portrayal of her remarks in the media saying that:  "There currently exists no law referencing homosexuality in Liberia, and as such the President could not be defending a law on homosexuality. The President is on record as saying [...] that any law brought before her regarding homosexuality will be vetoed. This statement also applies to an initial attempt by two members of the Liberian legislature to introduce tougher laws targeting homosexuality." The letter added "the status quo in Liberia has been one of tolerance and no one has ever been prosecuted under that [current] law," and went on to hint at future possible liberalization stating that "the President thinks that with the unprecedented freedom of speech and expression Liberia enjoys today, our budding democracy will be strong enough to accommodate new ideas and debate both their value and Liberia's laws with openness, respect and independence."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/23/liberian-sex-laws-sirleaf | title=Letters: Liberia sex laws | work=The Guardian | date=22 March 2012 | accessdate=24 March 2012 | location=London}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' published a correction to its story, "Nobel peace prize winner defends law criminalising homosexuality in Liberia was updated to restore material cut in the editing process. The restored material clarifies the stance that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is taking on laws concerning homosexuality in Liberia. That is: she refuses to dismantle the existing anti-sodomy law, while also saying she will refuse to sign two new bills that would toughen laws on homosexuality." The comments, letter, and clarification suggest that she considered the status quo for gay rights in Liberia to be one of ''de facto'' tolerance up until the recent controversy and would not support decriminalization of homosexuality, but also refuses to support further criminalisation of homosexual acts which was being attempted in Liberia and hints at future liberalization. This is a view she reaffirmed during an interview with Tony Blair.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/mar/19/liberia-tony-blair-anti-gay-law-video | title=Liberia's president and Tony Blair discuss anti-gay law&nbsp;– video | publisher=The Guardian | date=19 March 2012 | accessdate=9 October 2012 | author=Tamasin Ford & Bonnie Allen | location=London}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Upon her election to office, Sirleaf made her first foreign trip as President to neighboring [[Côte d'Ivoire]], meeting with Ivorian President [[Laurent Gbagbo]] in an attempt to repair relations between the two countries following Côte d'Ivoire's support of the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] during the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-115724878.html |title = Liberia's president-elect Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in Ivory Coast on first foreign trip | newspaper=[[Associated Press|AP]] Worldstream | date = 29 November 2005}}</ref> During the [[2010–2011 Ivorian crisis]], Sirleaf, as chairperson of the [[Mano River Union]], supported ECOWAS's recognition of Gbagbo's opponent, [[Alassane Ouattara]], as the winner of the [[Ivorian presidential election, 2010|disputed presidential election]], but rejected calls for a military solution to the crisis.<ref>{{cite news | first = D Kaihenneh | last=Sengbeh | url=http://www.1847post.com/article/mru-opposes-force-ecowas-c%C3%B4te-ivoire | title=MRU Opposes Force by Ecowas in Côte Ivoire | newspaper=The 1847 Post | date=24 January 2011}}</ref>

Sirleaf has forged close relations with the United States, Liberia's traditional ally. Following the establishment of [[United States Africa Command]] (AFRICOM) by the [[United States military]], Sirleaf offered to allow the US to headquarter the new command in Liberia, the only African leader to do so.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.emergingminds.org/Liberian-President-disappointed-over-U.S.-decision-on-AFRICOM.html |title=Liberian President disappointed over U.S. decision on AFRICOM |work=Emerging Minds |date=24 February 2008}}</ref> The command was eventually headquartered in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. On 15 March 2006, President Sirleaf addressed a joint meeting of the [[United States Congress]], asking for American support to help her country "become a brilliant beacon, an example to Africa and the world of what love of liberty can achieve."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200603150786.html |title=Liberia: President Sirleaf Thanks U.S. Congress, Asks for Continuing Support |work=allAfrica.com |date=15 March 2006}}</ref>

Sirleaf has also strengthened relations with the People's Republic of China, reaffirming Liberia's commitment to the [[One-China policy]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Janjay |last=Campbell |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200710010699.html |title = Liberia: Ellen Renews "One China" Commitment | newspaper=allAfrica.com | date = 1 October 2007}}</ref> In return, China has contributed to Liberia's reconstruction, building several transmitters to extend the [[Liberia Broadcasting System]] nationwide and constructing a new campus for the [[University of Liberia]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://lr.china-embassy.org/eng/sghdhzxxx/t522906.htm | title = Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Attends the Hand-over Ceremony of China-aided LBS Rehabilitation and Expansion Project and the Launching of CRI FM Programs in Liberia | publisher=Embassy of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of Liberia | date = 19 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://lr.china-embassy.org/eng/dszc/spta/t718568.htm | title = Remarks at the Handover Ceremony of the China-aided Fendall Campus of the University of Liberia  | publisher=Embassy of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of Liberia | date = 20 July 2010}}</ref>

Sirleaf is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

During the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], Sirleaf added her voice to a chorus of calls from the international community for [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] to cease the use of violence and tactics of political repression. However, she criticized the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in Libya, declaring that "violence does not help the process whichever way it comes".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2011/03/29/president-sirleaf-against-air-strikes-in-libya/|agency=Afrique Avenir|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=5 April 2011|title=President Sirleaf against air strikes in Libya}}</ref> Her government later severed diplomatic ties with Libya, stating that "The Government took the decision after a careful review of the situation in Libya and determined that the Government of Colonel Gaddafi has lost the legitimacy to govern Libya."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75D0KR20110614|title=Liberia cuts ties with Gaddafi's Libya|newspaper=[[Reuters]] Africa|date=14 June 2011}}</ref>

On Friday, 27 February 2015, President Sirleaf was expected to make a visit to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], according to an official online statement from the Office of the [[White House Press Secretary]]. Among other issues, they will discuss the hope to expeditiously close the recent 2013-2015 [[Ebola virus epidemic]], which has heavily affected [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Guinea]], and other areas in West Africa (and beyond in other countries due to importation of cases for treatment and some new infections), down to an ideal of zero reported cases in Liberia and nearby areas in the near future, with continuing monitoring and reporting, care, support, and fiscal and professional assistance. They will also discuss how to sustain and rebuild the healthcare infrastructure and the country's other difficulties in the wake of the massive outbreak's morbidity and mortality toll and impact on the area, as well as review progress that has been made and efforts to continue it.<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/20/statement-press-secretary-visit-liberian-president-ellen-johnson-sirleaf</ref>

Following her election in 2005, Sirleaf pledged to promote national reconciliation by bringing in opposition leaders into her administration.<ref name=profile>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4395978.stm|title=Profile: Liberia's 'Iron Lady'|work=BBC News |date=23 November 2005}}</ref> Opposition politicians who joined her initial administration included Minister of Transport Jeremiah Sulunteh, Minister of Education [[Joseph Korto]], and Ambassador to the United Nations [[Nathaniel Barnes]].
