'''Princeton University ''' is a [[private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. Founded in 1746 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] as the {{anchor|College of New Jersey}} College of New Jersey, Princeton was the fourth chartered institution of higher education in the American colonies<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.princeton.edu/pr/facts/revolution.html |title=Princeton in the American Revolution| publisher =Princeton University, Office of Communications |accessdate=May 7, 2007 | quote = the fourth college to be established in British North America.}}</ref>{{Efn | name=founding | Princeton is the fourth institution of higher learning to obtain a collegiate charter, conduct classes or grant degrees, based upon dates that do not seem to be in dispute. Princeton and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] both claim the fourth oldest founding date; the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899, its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = [[University of Pennsylvania]] | url = http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html | title = Building Penn's Brand | newspaper = Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/older.shtml | type = FAQ | title = Princeton vs. Penn: Which is the Older Institution? | publisher = Princeton}}</ref>  To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a [[Log College]] was operated by [[William Tennent|William]] and [[Gilbert Tennent]], the Presbyterian ministers, in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], from 1726 until 1746; it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726.  Princeton, however, has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts "do not warrant" such an interpretation.<ref>{{Citation | title = Companion | url = http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html | publisher = Princeton}}</ref>  [[Columbia University]] was chartered and began collegiate classes in 1754.

[[Image:Rhind sculpture at Princeton.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture by [[J. Massey Rhind]] (1892), [[Alexander Hall (Princeton University)|Alexander Hall]], Princeton University]]

[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the '''College of New Jersey''', later Princeton University, in 1746 in order to train ministers.<ref name = Princeton>{{cite web | title = Princeton University 250th Anniversary Celebration Collection|url= http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC180/#description |work= Library Finding Aids|publisher= Princeton University|accessdate= 11 November 2012}}</ref> The college was the educational and religious capital of Scots-Irish America. In 1756, the college moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau|house]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became president in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794.  During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.<ref>{{Citation | first = Jeffry H | last = Morrison | title = John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic | year = 2005}}</ref> Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

In 1812, the eighth president of Princeton (still the College of New Jersey), Ashbel Green (1812–23), helped establish a theological seminary next door.<ref>http://www.princeton.edu/pub/presidents/green/</ref> The plan to extend the theological curriculum met with "enthusiastic approval on the part of the authorities at the College of New Jersey".<ref>http://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?menu1_id=2030&menu2_id=2031&id=1264</ref> Today, Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary maintain separate institutions with ties that include services such as cross-registration and mutual library access.<ref>https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/pts.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.princeton.edu/gradschool/academics/exchange/</ref>

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nassau Hall|work= Princeton University: The First 250 Years |publisher=Steering Committee for Princeton's 250th Anniversary|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months. Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin lion sculptures that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.<ref name=apc-nassau-hall/> Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leitch |first=Alexander |date=December 21, 1978 |title=A Princeton Companion |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/nassau_hall.html |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691046549}}</ref>

[[James McCosh]] took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]]. During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[Gothic revival|High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://etc.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html | title= Princeton Companion | publisher = Princeton |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> McCosh Hall is named in his honor.<ref name=apc-nassau-hall />

In 1879, the first thesis for a Ph.D. was submitted by James F. Williamson, Class of 1877.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.  During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university.

In 1900, the Graduate School was established.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web| title = A Princeton Chronology | work =Princeton University: The First 250 Years|publisher=Steering Committee for Princeton University's 250th Anniversary |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref>

In 1902, [[Woodrow Wilson]], graduate of the Class of 1879, was elected the 13th president of the university.<ref>{{Citation | title = Princeton University: The First 250 Years | publisher = Steering Committee for Princeton University's 250th Anniversary}}</ref>  Under Wilson, Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept in the US that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.

In 1906, the reservoir [[Lake Carnegie]] was created by [[Andrew Carnegie]].<ref name="autogenerated2"/> A collection of historical photographs of the building of the lake is housed at the [[Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library]] on Princeton's campus.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://findingaids.princeton.edu/getEad?eadid=AC065&kw=ac065 |title= Historical Photograph Collection, Lake Carnegie Construction Photographs, circa 1905–1907 | work = Finding Aids |publisher= Princeton |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref>

On October 2, 1913, the [[Princeton University Graduate College]] was dedicated.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

In 1919 the School of Architecture was established.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

In 1933, [[Albert Einstein]] became a lifetime member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with an office on the Princeton campus.  While always independent of the university, the Institute for Advanced Study occupied offices in Jones Hall for 6 years, from its opening in 1933, until their own campus was finished and opened in 1939. This helped start an incorrect impression that it was part of the university, one that has never been completely eradicated.

===Coeducation at Princeton University===
{{main|Coeducation at Princeton University}}
[[File:Princeton University Alexander.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hall (Princeton University)|Alexander Hall]], Princeton University]]

In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974.  Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention.  Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in Turkish history in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study "critical languages" in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by [[Sally Frank]], [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Associated Press | title = Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | date = January 23, 1991 | page = A4}}</ref> In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of "Old Nassau" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/princeton-song-goes-coed.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1987-03-01 | title = Princeton song goes coed}}</ref> In 2009-11, Professor [[Nannerl O. Keohane]] chaired a committee on undergraduate women's leadership at Princeton, appointed by President [[Shirley M. Tilghman]].<ref>http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S30/05/88Q71/index.xml</ref>

==Campus==

===Cannon Green===
Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of Nassau Hall is the "Big Cannon," which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was taken to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott & Co. |location=Philadelphia |page=139}}</ref> In 1836 the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott & Co. |location=Philadelphia |pages=317–8}}</ref>

A second "Little Cannon" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman|title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions|volume=2|year=1879|edition=2nd|publisher=J.

In years when the Princeton football team beats the teams of both [[Harvard University]] and [[Yale University]] in the same season, Princeton celebrates with a bonfire on Cannon Green. This occurred in 2012, ending a five-year drought.  The next bonfire happened on Sunday, 24 November 2013, and was broadcast live over the Internet.<ref name="2013bonfire">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/odus/bonfire/ |title=Bonfire - Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students - Bonfire |publisher=Princeton.edu |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref>

====Residential colleges====
Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities—such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms—and a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the "New New Quad") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including "waffle ceilings", the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url= http://etc.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html |title=Andrew Fleming West |publisher=Etc.princeton.edu |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> Forbes currently houses over 400 undergraduates and a number of resident graduate students in its residential halls.

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Oxford University and Cambridge University. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090#.VGSgkJOsUk8 |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's "Constructed Utopia" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |publisher=The New England Quarterly | date= June 2011 | accessdate =November 13, 2014}}</ref>

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]].  Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.<ref name = "autogenerated1" />  The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.

====McCarter Theatre====

The Tony-award-winning<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?start=0&year=1994&award=Regional+Theatre+Award&lname=&fname=&show= | title =The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards – Official Website by IBM |publisher=Tony awards | date= May 1, 2000 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> [[McCarter Theatre]] was built by the [[Princeton Triangle Club]], a student performance group, using club profits and a gift from Princeton University alumnus Thomas McCarter.  Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue, fall show, and Reunions performances in McCarter. McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the United States.

====Art Museum====
{{main|Princeton University Art Museum}}
The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.

Numbering over 72,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of Pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented.  The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.

====University Chapel====

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of US$21 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world. Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university has the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over US$2 [[million]] for undergraduates).<ref name="CNBC">{{cite news | title=Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student | year=2011 | work=CNBC | url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11}}</ref> Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news | title=Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion | year=2006 | work=The Daily Princetonian | url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/10/27/news/16400.shtml}}</ref> Some of Princeton's wealth is invested in its art museum, which features works by [[Claude Monet]],  [[Vincent van Gogh]],  [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Andy Warhol]] among other prominent artists.

==Academics==
[[Image:PrincetonCourtyard.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of East Pyne]]

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]] , [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and engineering. Doctoral education is available in all disciplines.<ref name="degree programs">{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/ |title=Academic Departments & Programs |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}</ref> It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in architecture, engineering, finance, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

===Undergraduate===
Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a "precept." To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as "junior papers." Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Princeton University Honor Committee |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}</ref> The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/ |title=Honor Code |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68 |title=Honor Code |publisher=YouTube |date=September 12, 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/ |title=Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline |publisher=Princeton University Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}</ref> Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/08/sources/ |title=Acknowledging Your Sources |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}</ref>

They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22law.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1277406249-7I3hc765HdqNtR0HmzFjDw|work=New York Times|title=In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That|accessdate=June 24, 2010 | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | date=June 21, 2010}}</ref> Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison.

The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|accessdate=January 28, 2011 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=January 29, 2010}}</ref>

===Graduate===
[[Image:ClevelandTowerWatercolor20060829.jpg|thumb|left|This watercolor shows [[Cleveland Tower]] as seen from just outside Procter Hall at the Old [[Princeton University Graduate College|Graduate College]] in the noon autumn sun.]]

The Graduate School has about 2,600 students in 42 academic departments and programs in social sciences, engineering, natural sciences, and humanities. In 2012–13, it received over 11,000 applications for admission and awarded 319 Ph.D. degrees and 170 final master's degrees. Princeton has no [[medical school]], [[law school]], or [[business school]]. (A short-lived [[Princeton Law School]] folded in 1852.) It offers professional graduate degrees in architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy, the last through the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], founded in 1930 as the School of Public and International Affairs and renamed in 1948 after university president (and US President) [[Woodrow Wilson]].

==Student life and culture==
[[Image:Walker-1903-cuyler.jpg|thumb|left|Cuyler, Class of 1903, and Walker Halls are Princeton dormitories with Collegiate Gothic architecture.]]

University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |title=Housing and Dining |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}</ref> Freshmen and sophomores must live in [[residential college]]s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two [[Model United Nations]] conferences, PMUNC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmunc.org/| title=Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}</ref> in the fall for high school students and PICSim<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picsim.org/|title=Princeton Interactive Crisis Simulation (PICSIM)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}</ref> in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The 4-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is [[need blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools|title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities|accessdate=October 30, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions "the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity," but goes on to say that "still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus."

===Traditions===
*''Arch Sings'' – Late-night concerts that feature one or several of Princeton's undergraduate ''[[a cappella]]'' groups, such as the [[Princeton Nassoons]], [[Princeton Tigertones]], and the [[Princeton Footnotes]].

"[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]" has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'''s melody, which also fits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|accessdate=July 5, 2008 | publisher = Princeton}}</ref>

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem.  It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed "[[Old Nassau reaction]]" because the solution turns orange and then black.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed054p167.2 |title=The Old Nassau reaction | work = Journal of Chemical Education | publisher = ACS Publications and Division of Chemical Education | accessdate = February 19, 2012}}</ref>
