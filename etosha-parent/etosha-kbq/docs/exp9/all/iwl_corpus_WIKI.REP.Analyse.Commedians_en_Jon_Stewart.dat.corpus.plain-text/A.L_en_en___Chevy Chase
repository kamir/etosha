'''Cornelius Crane''' "'''Chevy'''" '''Chase''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|v|i}}; born October 8, 1943)<ref>{{cite web|title=Chevy Chase biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/chevy-chase-9542517|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref> is an American comedian, actor, and writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/video/best-emmy-moments-163134468.html |title=yahoo.com |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> Born into a prominent New York family, Chase worked a plethora of odd jobs before he moved into comedy and began acting with ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''. He quickly became a key cast member in the inaugural season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' where his ''[[Weekend Update]]'' skit soon became a staple of the show.

Chase is well known for his portrayal of the character [[Clark Griswold]] in four ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' films, and for his roles in comedies including ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (1978), ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'' (1985), ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985), and ''[[¡Three Amigos!]]'' (1986). He has hosted the [[Academy Awards]] twice (1987 and 1988) and briefly had his own late-night talk show, ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]''. In 2009, he became a regular cast member ([[Pierce Hawthorne]]) on the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]''. Chase left the show in 2012, having already filmed most of the episodes in season 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2012/11/chevy-chase-is-leaving-community/|title=Chevy Chase is leaving "Community"|work=Uproxx.com|last=Guerrero|first=Danger|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=November 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/chevy-chase-leaving-nbcs-community/|title=Chevy Chase Leaving NBC's "Community"|work=Deadline.com|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=November 21, 2012}}</ref>

== Early life ==

=== Family ===
Chevy Chase was born in [[Lower Manhattan]], New York City and was raised in [[Woodstock, New York]].<ref>http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/48252/</ref> His father, Edward Tinsley "Ned" Chase, was a prominent Manhattan book editor and magazine writer. His mother, Cathalene Parker (née Browning), a [[concert pianist]] and [[librettist]], was the daughter of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Miles Browning]], who served a critical role at the [[Battle of Midway]] in [[World War II]]; she was adopted as a child by her stepfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, heir to [[Crane Co.|The Crane Company]], and took the name Cathalene Crane.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E1EF73D59137B93C3A8178CD85F468685F9 | work=The New York Times | title=Explorer's Survivor Omitted | date=July 11, 1962}}</ref> Chase's paternal grandfather was artist/illustrator [[Edward Leigh Chase]], and his great-uncle was painter/teacher [[Frank Swift Chase]]. His maternal grandmother, Cathalene (Parker), was an opera singer who performed several times at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref name="BurginHoltz2009">{{cite book|author1=Martha Burgin|author2=Maureen Holtz|title=Robert Allerton: the private man & the public gifts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eWgmAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=The News-Gazette|page=132}}</ref> Chase was named for his adoptive grandfather Cornelius, while the nickname Chevy was bestowed by his grandmother, derived from the medieval English ''[[The Ballad of Chevy Chase]]''. As a descendant of the Scottish [[Clan Douglas]], the name "Chevy" seemed appropriate to her.<ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not" />

Chase is a fourteenth-generation [[New York City|New Yorker]], and was listed in the [[Social Register]] at an early age. His mother's ancestors arrived in Manhattan starting in 1624; among his ancestors are New York City mayors [[Stephanus Van Cortlandt]] and [[John Johnstone (mayor)|John Johnstone]]; the [[Schuyler family]] through his ancestor Gertrude Schuyler, the wife of Stephanus Van Cortlandt; [[John Morin Scott]], General of the New York Militia during the [[American Revolution]]; [[Anne Hutchinson]], dissident [[Puritan]] preacher and [[Healer (alternative medicine)|healer]]; and ''[[Mayflower]]'' passengers and signers of the [[Mayflower Compact]], [[John Howland]],<ref>Cornelius Crane "Chevy" Chase, Edward Tinsley "Ned" Chase, Edward Leigh Chase, Charles Dennison Chase, Henry Seymour Chase, Jarvis Brown Chase, Paul Chase m.

Desire Howland, daughter of John Howland & Elizabeth Tilley.</ref> and the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]], [[William Brewster (Pilgrim)|William Brewster]]. According to his brother John:

<blockquote>"[Chevy] once told me that people who defined themselves in terms of their ancestry were like potatoes – the best parts of them were underground. He disdained the pretension of my mother's side of the family, as embodied by her mother, Cattie".<ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not" /></blockquote>

As a child, Chase vacationed at [[Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)|Castle Hill]], the Cranes' summer estate in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].<ref name="LLC1993">{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zCYAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32|date=August 23, 1993|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=32|issn=0028-7369}}</ref> Chase's parents divorced when he was four; his father remarried into the [[Folgers]] coffee family, and his mother remarried twice. He has stated that he grew up in an upper middle class environment and that his adoptive maternal grandfather did not bequeath any assets to Chase's mother when he died.<ref name="stern918">Chase, Chevy, interview on ''Howard Stern Show'', Sirius Satellite Radio, September 18, 2008.</ref> In a 2007 biography, Chase claims that he was [[child abuse|abused]] as a child by his mother and stepfather, John Cederquist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/04/24/us-chase-biography-idUSN2333396920070424|title=Chevy Chase says in book he was beaten by mother|publisher=Reuters |date=April 24, 2007|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref> Both his parents died in 2005.

=== Schooling and music ===
Chase attended [[Riverdale Country School]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Jarvis |first=Jeff |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085892,00.html |title=Chevy Chase's New High: Fatherhood |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> before being expelled. He ultimately graduated from the [[Stockbridge School]]<ref>http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M9oVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ARMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2217,6446264&dq=stockbridge+school&hl=en</ref> in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]. He then attended [[Haverford College]] during the 1962–63 term, where he was noted for [[slapstick]] comedy and an absurd sense of physical humor (including his signature pratfalls and "sticking forks into his orifices"<ref name="biconews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.biconews.com/2003/10/28/prankly-speaking/ |title=biconews.com |publisher=biconews.com |date=2003-10-28 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref>). During a 2009 interview on ''[[The Today Show]]'', he ostensibly verified the oft-publicized [[urban legend]] that he was [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] for harboring a cow in his fourth floor room,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.haverford.edu/haverblog/2009/10/08/happy-birthday-chevy-about-that-cow/ |title=blogs.haverford.edu |publisher=blogs.haverford.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> although his former roommate David Felson asserted in a 2003 interview that Chase left for academic reasons.<ref name="biconews.com"/> Chase transferred to [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]], where he studied a [[Pre-medical|pre-med curriculum]] and graduated in 1967 with a BA in English.

Chase did not enter [[medical school]], which meant he would be subject to [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam War|the military draft]]. Chase was not drafted; when he appeared in January 1989 as the first guest of the just-launched [[The Pat Sajak Show|late-night ''Pat Sajak Show'']], he said he had convinced his draft board he deserved a [[4F (military conscription)|4-F classification]] by "falsely claiming, among other things, that he had homosexual tendencies".<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DE173AF932A25752C0A96F948260&pagewanted=print Late-Night Chitchat Additions: Pat Sajak and Arsenio Hall], a January 11, 1989 review from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

Chase played drums with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school friends [[Walter Becker]] and [[Donald Fagen]]. Chase has called the group "a bad [[jazz]] band"; Becker and Fagen later founded the successful group [[Steely Dan]]. Chase has [[absolute pitch]].<ref name="I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not">Fruchter, Rena. ''I'm Chevy Chase...and You're Not''. Virgin Books, 2007.</ref> He played drums and keyboards for a [[rock music|rock]] band called Chamaeleon Church, which recorded one album for [[MGM Records]] before disbanding in 1969. To give the album a more soft-rock sound, producer [[Alan Lorber]] made several alterations in the mixing, including the muting of Chase's bass drum, and Chase was reportedly incensed when he heard the final mix.<ref>Joynson, Vernon (1995). [http://alextsu.narod.ru/borderlinebooks/us6070s/index.html ''Fuzz, Acid, & Flowers'']. London: Borderline Books. See entry on Chamaeleon Church.</ref> Before becoming famous as a writer, actor and comedian, Chase worked in many odd jobs including as a [[cab driver]], [[truck driver]], motorcycle messenger, [[construction worker]], waiter, [[busboy]], fruit picker, [[produce]] manager of a supermarket, [[audio engineer]], salesman in a wine store, and a theater usher.

=== Early career ===
Chase was a member of an early underground comedy ensemble called ''Channel One'' which he co-founded in 1967. He also wrote a one-page spoof on ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' for ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' in 1970 and was a writer for the short-lived ''[[Smothers Brothers]]'' TV show comeback in the early 1970s. Chase made the move to comedy as a full-time career by 1973, when he became a cast member of ''The [[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'', a syndicated satirical radio series. The ''Lampoon Radio Hour'' also featured [[John Belushi]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Bill Murray]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], all of whom later became "Not-Ready-For-Prime Time Players" on ''NBC Saturday Night'' (later retitled ''NBC's Saturday Night'' and finally ''Saturday Night Live''). Chase and Belushi also appeared in National Lampoon's [[off-Broadway]] revue ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings|Lemmings]]'', a sketch and musical send-up of popular [[youth culture]] (in which Chase also played the drums during the musical numbers). He appeared in the theatrical release ''[[The Groove Tube]]'' which was directed by another co-founder of ''Channel One'', [[Ken Shapiro]], and which featured several ''Channel One'' sketches.

== ''Saturday Night Live'' ==
Chase was one of the original cast members of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''), [[NBC]]'s late-night comedy television show, beginning in October 1975. During the first season, he introduced every show except one by saying, "Live from New York, it's ''[[Saturday Night Live|Saturday Night!]]''" The remark was often preceded by a [[pratfall]], known as "The Fall of the Week". Chase became known for his skill at [[physical comedy]]. In one [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]], he mimicked a real-life incident in which President [[Gerald Ford]] accidentally tripped while disembarking from [[Air Force One]] in Salzburg, Austria.<ref>{{cite news

Chase was the original anchor for the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment of ''SNL'', and his catchphrase introduction, "I'm Chevy Chase . . . and you're not" became well known. His trademark conclusion, "Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow" was later resurrected by [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Tina Fey]]. Chase also wrote comedy material for ''Weekend Update.'' For example, he wrote and performed "The News for the Hard of Hearing". In this skit, Chase would read the top story of the day, aided by [[Garrett Morris]], who would repeat the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of Weekend Update would later be the inspiration for other mock-news shows such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]].''<ref>{{cite news

Chase also performed in other skits on ''SNL'' including a recurring role as the [[Land Shark (Saturday Night Live)|Land Shark]], a parody of the blockbuster movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. His racially charged "word association" skit opposite [[Richard Pryor]] from ''SNL's'' first season is frequently cited by television critics as one of the funniest (and most daring) skits in the show's history. [[Image:Chevy Chase 1976.jpg|thumb|Chevy Chase at the private party after the premiere of the movie ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]]'', December 1976]]

Chase became the first breakout star of ''SNL''. He was committed contractually to ''Saturday Night Live'' for only one year as a writer, not an ''SNL'' cast member. He had signed a one-year writing contract and became a cast member during rehearsals just before the show's [[premiere]]. Nonetheless, he received two [[Emmy Awards]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his comedy writing and live comic acting.  In ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'''s February, 2015 appraisal of all 141 ''SNL'' cast members to date, Chase was ranked tenth in overall importance.  "Strange as it sounds, Chase might be the most ''under''-rated ''SNL'' player," they wrote.  "It took him only one season to define the franchise ... without that deadpan arrogance, the whole ''SNL'' style of humor would fall flat."<ref>''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.</ref>

In a 1975 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine cover story which called him "The funniest man in America", NBC executives referred to Chase as "The first real potential successor to [[Johnny Carson]]" and claimed he would begin guest-hosting ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' within six months of the article. Chase dismissed chatter that he could be the next Carson by telling ''New York'', "I'd never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities." In fact, Chase did not even appear on the program until 1978, when he was promoting a prime time special for NBC. Carson later said of Chase; "He couldn't ad lib a fart after a baked bean dinner".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.menshealth.com/mhlists/nastiest_things_said_by_men/index.php |title=The 25 Meanest Things Ever Said by Men |publisher=Menshealth.com |date=June 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref>

''TV Guide: the official collector's guide'', Bangzoom Publishers.</ref> In addition, Chase spoke of Kovacs' influence on his work in an appearance in the 1982 documentary called ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083898/|title=Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius|date=November 17, 1982|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref>

=== Leaving ''SNL'' ===
In 1976, Chase was the first member of the original cast to leave the show, after his contract ended. While Chase was offered starring roles in films due to his ''SNL'' fame, he attributes his departure to wanting to be with his girlfriend, Jacqueline Carlin, who did not want to move to New York.<ref name="snl20050220">{{cite episode | title=Live From New York: The First 5 Years of Saturday Night Live | network=NBC | airdate=February 20, 2005}}</ref> After leaving ''SNL'', Chase moved to Los Angeles and married Carlin. Chase made a few appearances as the second season wound down; he was eventually replaced by [[Bill Murray]].

After leaving the show, Chase hosted ''SNL'' eight times through 1997. He appeared on the show's 25th anniversary special in 1999 and was interviewed for a 2005 NBC special on ''SNL'''s first five years. He also made five later appearances: a ''Caddyshack'' skit featuring Bill Murray, a 1997 episode with guest host [[Chris Farley]], as the Landshark in Weekend Update in 2001 episode, again on Weekend Update in 2007, and in Justin Timberlake's monologue in 2013 (as a member of the [[Five-Timers Club]], where he was reunited with his ''[[Three Amigos]]'' co-stars [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]]).

In February 2015, Chase appeared on ''SNL'''s 40th anniversary special.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCoy |first=Terrence |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/17/chevy-chase-after-saturday-night-live-too-mean-to-succeed/?hpid=z5 |title='&#39;Chevy Chase, Too Mean To Succeed'&#39; Washington Post 2015-02-17 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref>

== Film ==
Chase's early film roles included ''[[Tunnel Vision (film)|Tunnel Vision]]'', the box office hit ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'', and ''[[Oh Heavenly Dog]]''. The role of Eric 'Otter' Stratton in ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' was originally written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on ''Foul Play''.<ref name="stern918" /> The role went to [[Tim Matheson]] instead. Chase said in an interview that he chose to do ''Foul Play'' so he could do "real acting" for the first time in his career instead of just doing "schtick".<ref name="Live From New York">Shales, Tom. ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live. Back Bay Books, 2003.</ref> Chase followed ''Foul Play'' with the successful [[Harold Ramis]] comedy ''[[Caddyshack]]'', in 1980. That same year, he also reunited with [[Goldie Hawn]] (his co-star in ''Foul Play'') in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' and released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by [[Randy Newman]], [[Barry White]], [[Bob Marley]], [[the Beatles]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], [[The Troggs]], and the [[Sugarhill Gang]].

[[Image:Chevy Chase 1980.jpg|thumb|Chevy Chase at the premiere of the movie ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'', December 10, 1980]]
Chase narrowly escaped death by electrocution during the filming of ''[[Modern Problems]]'' in 1980. During a sequence in which Chase's character wears "landing lights" as he dreams that he is an airplane, the current in the lights short-circuited and arced through Chase's arm, back, and neck muscles. The near-death episode caused Chase to experience a period of deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], as his marriage to Jacqueline had ended just prior to the start of filming. Chase continued his film career in 1983's ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', directed by Ramis and written by [[John Hughes (film director)|John Hughes]]. He married Jayni Luke in 1983, and in 1985, he starred in ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', the first of two films based on [[Gregory Mcdonald]]'s ''[[Fletch (novel)|Fletch]]'' books. Chase joined ''SNL'' veterans [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]] in the Lorne Michaels-produced comedy ''[[¡Three Amigos!]]'' in 1986, declaring in an interview that making ''¡Three Amigos!'' was the most fun he had had on a film. The trio hosted ''SNL'' that year, the only time the show has had three hosts on one show.

At the height of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7 million per film and was a highly visible celebrity. He appeared alongside [[Paul Simon]], one of his best friends, in Simon's 1986 second video for "[[You Can Call Me Al]]", in which he lip-syncs all of Simon's lyrics. Chase hosted the [[Academy Awards]] in 1987 and 1988, signing on to the proceedings in 1987 with the opener, "Good evening, Hollywood phonies!" Chase filmed a sequel to ''Vacation'', 1985's ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'' and then a third, ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', in 1989, which, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films, airing on [[NBC]] every December. He played saxophone onstage at Simon's free concert at the Great Lawn in [[Central Park]] in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video "[[Voices That Care]]" to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in [[Operation Desert Storm]], and supported the [[International Red Cross]].

=== Later work ===
Chase's career took a downturn in the early '90s. Chase had three consecutive film flops: 1991's [[Razzie|Razzie award]]-nominated ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', 1992's ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man (film)|Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'', and 1994's ''[[Cops & Robbersons]]''. The three releases had a combined gross of $34 million in the U.S. Even the durable ''Vacation'' series ground to a halt, following 1997's ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' installment. Some of the more recent movies starring Chase (e.g., ''Vacuums'', ''[[Rent-a-Husband]]'', ''Goose!'') have not been released in the United States. He returned to mainstream movie-making in 2006, co-starring with [[Tim Allen]] and [[Courteney Cox]] in the comedy ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'', though it was both a critical and commercial failure.

In September 1993, Chase hosted ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'', a weeknight talk show, for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. Though it had high commercial expectations, the show was cancelled by Fox after only five weeks. Chase later appeared in a commercial for [[Doritos]], airing during the [[Super Bowl]], in which he made humorous reference to the show's failure.

Chase was [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding's]] 1993 Man of the Year, and received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1994. After having starred with [[Farrah Fawcett]] in the relatively successful ''[[Man of the House (1995 film)|Man of the House]]'' in 1995, he received [[Harvard Lampoon]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.

In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref>

He was [[celebrity roast|roasted]] by the [[New York Friars' Club|Friars Club]] for a [[Comedy Central]] television special in 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually mean.<ref>{{cite web|author=Virginia Heffernan|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074752/|title=Chevy Chase, humiliated again|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=December 2, 2002 |accessdate=October 29, 2009}}</ref> The only cast members of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'s'' [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] who appeared at the roast were [[Laraine Newman]] (one of the actors on the show), [[Al Franken]], a bit player & writer on the show & eventually a [[US Senator]], and [[Paul Shaffer]] (a band leader on SNL in the 70's and the host of the roast).

In 2005, Chase was the keynote speaker at [[Princeton University]]'s Class Day, part of commencement activities.

On March 20, 2012, Dan Aykroyd announced through his Facebook page that he is working with Chase on a script for a new comedy that would star the two actors. The film would be their fifth together and first since 1991's ''Nothing but Trouble''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/-/world/13222081/dan-aykroyd-chevy-chase-writing-a-movie/ |title=Yahoo!7 News |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref>

== Return to television ==
Chase [[guest-star]]red as an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] murder suspect in "[[In Vino Veritas (Law & Order episode)|In Vino Veritas]]", the November 3, 2006 episode of ''[[Law & Order]]''. He also guest-starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]'' in two episodes as a former love interest of [[Sally Field]]'s character. Chase appeared in a prominent recurring role as villainous software magnate [[Ted Roark]] on the NBC spy-comedy ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''. In 2009, Chase and [[Dan Aykroyd]] provided voices for the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]".

Chase starred in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', as aging moist-towelette tycoon Pierce Hawthorne, starting in 2009. However, Chase left the show in 2012 after completing the majority of the episodes of Season 4. He returned for a cameo appearance in the Season 5 premiere. Though he had sometimes been involved in public disputes with creator [[Dan Harmon]] over the direction of the show, the role was nevertheless his most prominent in many years.

In 2010, he appeared in the film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'', as well as a short online film featuring the Griswold Family, and in the ''[[Funny or Die]]'' original comedy sketch "[[Presidential Reunion]]", where he played President Ford alongside other current and former ''SNL'' president impersonators.

== TV commercials ==
Chase has appeared in a number of television commercials, including [[Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group|Dollar Rent-a-Car]] (1996), [[Doritos]] (1996), [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] (1999), [[Aflac]] (2003), [[Cola Turka]] (2003), [[T-Mobile]] (2009) and [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] (2010).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000331/otherworks Chevy Chase – Other works<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Personal life ==
[[Image:Chevy Chase with FEMA.jpg|thumb|right|Chevy Chase with [[Urban Search and Rescue California Task Force 7|CA-TF7]] [[FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force|Search and Rescue]]. He thanked them for their work at [[World Trade Center]] after [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].]]

[[File:Gerald Ford and Chevy Chase.jpeg|thumb|right|Gerald Ford and Chevy Chase sit before the Conference on Humor and the Presidency held at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in 1986.]]

Chase is the father of three daughters, Cydney Cathalene (born January 4, 1983), Caley Leigh (born January 19, 1985), and Emily Evelyn (born September 29, 1988). He lives with his wife, Jayni (née Luke), in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]].

Chevy's first marriage to Jacqueline Carlin was formalized on December 4, 1976. After 17 months, his marriage to Carlin was dissolved through a divorce—the annulment was evidently related to his alcohol and cocaine use. His daily cocaine consumption was reportedly more than two grams (0.07 oz.), and the side effects of such drug use were megalomania, paranoia and incoherence.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hilland|first1=Doug|title=I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not|url=http://grantland.com/features/chevy-chase-saturday-night-live-career/|website=grantland.com|accessdate=August 27, 2014}}</ref>

In 1986, Chase was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford Clinic]] for treatment of an addiction to prescription [[analgesic|painkillers]]. His use of these drugs reportedly began after he experienced ongoing [[back pain]] related to the many pratfalls he took beginning with his ''Saturday Night Live'' appearances.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/us/chevy-chase-being-treated-for-addiction-to-painkillers.html |newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1986 | title= Chevy Chase Being Treated For Addiction to Painkillers |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref> In 2010, he said that his drug abuse had been "low level".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/chevy-chase-interview-1010 |work=Esquire | title= Chevy Chase: What I've Learned  |date=September 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 31, 2013| author=Fussman, Cal}}</ref>

Chase is an active [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]], charity fundraiser and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal Democrat]]. He raised money and campaigned for [[Bill Clinton]] in the 1990s and [[John Kerry]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]]. Following the 2004 elections, Chase criticized [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] during a speech at a [[People For the American Way]] benefit at the [[Kennedy Center]], referring to the President as an "uneducated, real lying schmuck" and a "dumb fuck". Event organizers and several Bush detractors present at the event distanced themselves from Chase's comments, with [[Norman Lear]] remarking, "he'll live with it, I won't."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3216-2004Dec15.html |title=It's the F-Time Show With Chevy Chase |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=December 16, 2004 |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Leiby}}</ref>
