He graduated from [[John Bowne High School]], and then the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]].<ref name=biskind>{{cite book|title=Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film |last=Biskind |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Biskind |year=2004|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= |isbn=0-684-86259-X |pages=463–464}}</ref><ref>Lurie, Rod. [http://www.thewrap.com/blog-entry/1494 "Harvey Weinstein Gets My Criticism of "The Reader" Wrong"] The Wrap, February 21, 2009</ref>

Weinstein, his brother Bob, and Corky Burger, independently produced rock concerts as Harvey & Corky Productions in Buffalo through most of the 1970s. Both Weinstein brothers had grown up with a passion for movies and they nurtured a desire to enter the film industry.   In the late 1970s, using profits from their concert promotion business, the brothers created a small independent film distribution company called [[Miramax]], named after their parents – Miriam and Max. The company's first releases were primarily music-oriented concert films such as [[Paul McCartney]]'s ''[[Rockshow]]''.

In the early 1980s Miramax acquired the rights to two British films of benefit shows filmed for the human rights organization [[Amnesty International]]. Working closely with [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]], the producer of the original films, the Weinstein brothers edited the two films into one movie tailored for the American market. The resulting film was released as ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in May 1982 and it became Miramax's first hit. The movie raised considerable sums for [[Amnesty International]] and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the United States.<ref name=biskind/><ref name=Mason>{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Ian Garrick|title = When Harvey met Mickey|publisher=New Statesman|date=October 11, 2004|url = http://www3.sympatico.ca/ian.g.mason/Harvey_Weinstein.htm|accessdate=January 11, 2007}}</ref>

==Further development of Miramax==
[[File:HarveyWeinstein(CannesPH).jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Weinstein at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], 2002.]]The Weinsteins slowly built upon this success throughout the 1980s with [[Art film|arthouse films]] that achieved critical attention and modest commercial success. Harvey Weinstein and Miramax gained wider attention in 1988 with the release of [[Errol Morris]]'s documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' which detailed the struggle of [[Randall Adams]], a wrongfully convicted inmate sentenced to [[death row]]. The publicity that soon surrounded the case resulted in the release of Adams and nationwide publicity for Miramax. In 1989, their successful launch release of [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' propelled Miramax to become the most successful independent studio in America.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coupez: Ces films que George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Jean Reno, Kim Basinger aimeraient oublier|pages=45|language=French|first=Christophe|last= Greuet|publisher=Carnot|year=2004|isbn=2-84855-073-2}}</ref>

Also in 1989, Miramax released two art-house films, ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'' and director [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s film ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'', both of which the [[MPAA]] [[MPAA film rating system|rating board]] gave an [[X-rating]], effectively stopping nationwide release for these films. Weinstein sued the MPAA over the rating system. His lawsuit was later thrown out, but got the MPAA to agree to introduce the new [[NC-17]] rating.

Miramax continued to grow its library of films and directors until, in 1993, after the success of ''[[The Crying Game]]'', [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] offered the Weinsteins $80 million for ownership of Miramax.<ref name="lsun">{{cite news |title=Miramax offices close, Disney says brand continues |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=''[[Lowell Sun]]''|date=January 29, 2010 |url=http://www.lowellsun.com/movies/ci_14294787 }}</ref> Agreeing to the deal that would cement their Hollywood clout and ensure that they would remain at the head of their company, Miramax followed the next year with their first blockbuster, [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' and distributed the popular independent film ''[[Clerks]]''.

Miramax won its first Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1996 with the victory of ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (''Pulp Fiction'' was nominated in 1994 but lost to ''[[Forrest Gump]]''). This started a string of critical successes that included ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' and ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.

==The Weinstein Company==
On March 29, 2005, it was announced that the Weinstein brothers would leave Miramax on September 30 to form their own production company, named [[The Weinstein Company]] with several other media executives, directors [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]], and [[Colin Vaines]], who had successfully run the production department at Miramax for ten years and moved with the brothers to head development in the Weinstein company.<ref>Paskin, Willa (June 16, 2005). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133754426.html "Weinsteins tap Miramax exex.(Bob and Harvey Weinstein appoint Colin Vaines, Tim Clawson and Irwin Reiter)]". ''[[Daily Variety]]''.</ref>

The new studio immediately garnered Academy Award nominations for ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Henderson Presents]]'', and box office success through ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4]]''.

The Weinstein Co. acquired U.S. rights to the film ''The Oath of Tobruk'', a documentary about the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|2011 Libyan revolution]], in 2012 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Zeitchik, Steven|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/05/libya-revolution-oath-tobruk-bhl-weinstein.html|title= Cannes 2012: Weinstein Co. buys Libyan revolution documentary |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref>

==Praise and criticism==
In 2004 Weinstein was appointed an honorary Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in recognition of his contributions to the British film industry (the award being "honorary" because he is a citizen of the United States).<ref>Minns, Adam (April 20, 2004). [http://www.screendaily.com/weinstein-to-be-awarded-honorary-cbe-by-queen/4018225.article "Weinstein to be awarded honorary CBE by Queen"]. Screen Daily.</ref>

While lauded for opening up the [[independent film]] market and making it financially viable, Weinstein has been criticized by some for the techniques he has allegedly applied in his business dealings. [[Peter Biskind]]'s book, ''Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film'',<ref name=biskind/> details criticism of Miramax's release history and editing of Asian films, such as ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. There is a rumour that when Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the U.S. release of ''Princess Mononoke'', Miyazaki sent him a samurai sword in the post. Attached to the blade was a stark message: "No cuts". The director chortles. "Actually, my producer did that. Although I did go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts." He smiles. "I defeated him."<ref>{{cite news |title=A god among animators |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1569689,00.html|first=Xan |last=Brooks |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 14, 2005 |accessdate=May 23, 2007}}</ref> Weinstein has always insisted that such editing was done in the interest of creating the most financially viable film. "I'm not cutting for fun", Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. "I'm cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies."<ref name="Mason" /><ref>Dean, Katie. [http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2003/12/61554?currentPage=2 "Studio Warns Kung Fu Site"], ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', December 15, 2003, Page 2</ref>

Another example cited by Biskind was [[Phillip Noyce]]'s ''[[The Quiet American (2002 film)|The Quiet American]]'', whose release Weinstein delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]], due to audience reaction in test screenings to the film's critical tone towards America's past foreign policy. After being told the film would go straight-to-video, Noyce planned to screen the film in [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in order to mobilize critics to pressure Miramax to release it theatrically. Weinstein decided to screen the film at the Festival only after he was lobbied by star [[Michael Caine]], who threatened to boycott publicity for another film he had made for Miramax. The film received mostly positive reviews at the Festival, and Miramax eventually released the film theatrically, but it was alleged that Miramax did not make a major effort to promote the film for Academy Award consideration, though Caine was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].<ref name=biskind/>

Weinstein's efforts to campaign for Oscars for his films during [[Oscar season]] led to a ban on such campaigns by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref name="atl">{{Cite web |last = Obst |first = Lynda |authorlink = |title = A Diminished Oscar Season |work=[[The Atlantic]] |location= |date = |url = http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/02/a-diminished-oscar-season/7309/ |format = |doi = |accessdate = October 29, 2010}}</ref>

Weinstein has also cultivated a reputation for ruthlessness and fits of anger. According to Biskind, Weinstein once put a ''[[New York Observer]]'' reporter in a headlock while throwing him out of a party. On another occasion, Weinstein excoriated director [[Julie Taymor]] and her husband during a disagreement over a test screening of her movie ''[[Frida]]''.<ref name="Mason"/>

In a 2004 piece in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Weinstein appeared somewhat repentant for his often aggressive discussions with directors and producers.<ref>Mnookin, Seth. [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/9985/ "How Harvey Weinstein Survived His Midlife Crisis (For Now)"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, October 4, 2004</ref> However, a ''[[Newsweek]]'' story on October 13, 2008, criticized Weinstein, who was accused of "hassling [[Sydney Pollack]] on his deathbed" about the release of the film ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]''. After Weinstein offered $1 million to charity if the accusation could be proven, journalist [[Nikki Finke]] published an email sent by [[Scott Rudin]] on August 22 asserting that Weinstein "harassed" [[Anthony Minghella]]'s widow and a bedridden Pollack until Pollack's family asked him to stop.<ref>''[[Newsweek]]'', October 13, 2008, Page 10</ref><ref>[[Finke, Nikki]].

In September 2009, Weinstein publicly voiced opposition to efforts to extradite [[Roman Polanski]] from [[Switzerland]] to the U.S. regarding 1977 charges of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old, to which Polanski had pled guilty before fleeing the country.<ref>Kay, Jeremy.

In November 2011, independent filmmaker Michael Bartlett blamed Weinstein for the poor quality of his film, ''[[World of the Dead: The Zombie Diaries]]'', citing pressure from Weinstein to deliver the film ahead of schedule. When Weinstein said, "This is the date you will deliver the film and if it isn't finished then we'll finish it for you", the post production was rushed and the editing and sound mix were not completed properly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2011/10/11/Michael-Bartlett-talks-ZOMBIE-DIARIES-2-and-why-you-SHOULD-NOT-buy-the-US-version|title= Quietearth.us Michael Bartlett talks ZOMBIE DIARIES 2 and why you SHOULD NOT buy the US version}}</ref>

In March 2012 Weinstein was made a Chevalier (knight) of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French Consulate in New York City in recognition of Miramax's efforts to increase the presence and popularity of foreign films in the United States.<ref>Cieply, Michael (March 2, 2012).

In 2013, ''[[New York Post]]'' film critic Kyle Smith accused Harvey Weinstein of making numerous [[Anti-Catholicism in literature and media|anti-Catholic films]], including ''[[Priest (1994 film)|Priest]]'' (1994), ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' (1997), ''[[The Magdalene Sisters]]'' (2002), and ''[[Philomena (film)|Philomena]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Kyle|title=Harvey Weinstein’s ‘Philomena’ attack ad|url=http://nypost.com/2013/12/07/harvey-weinsteins-philomena-attack-ad/|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=7 December 2013}}</ref>

==Activism==
Weinstein is also active on issues such as poverty, [[AIDS]], [[juvenile diabetes]], and [[multiple sclerosis]] research. He serves on the Board of the [[Robin Hood Foundation]], a New York City-based non-profit that targets poverty, and co-chaired one of its annual benefits.<ref name=AME>[http://www.ameinfo.com/133996.html "Harvey Weinstein launches Film Financing Circle "], AMEinfo.com, October 6, 2007</ref>
