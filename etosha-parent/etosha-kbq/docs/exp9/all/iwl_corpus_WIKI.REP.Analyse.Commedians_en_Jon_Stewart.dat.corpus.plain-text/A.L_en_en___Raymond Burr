==Early life==
Burr was born '''Raymond William Stacey Burr''' in [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]],<ref name="Grimes" /> to William Johnston Burr (1889–1985), a hardware salesman,<ref name="DailyNewsObit">Obituary. ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''. September 14, 1993.

He attended a military academy for a while and graduated from [[Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California)|Berkeley High School]].<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plan Sight'', 10-3</ref>

In later years, Burr freely invented stories of a happy childhood. He told ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' in 1986, for example, that when he was twelve and a half years old, his mother sent him to [[New Mexico]] for a year to work as a ranch hand. He was already his full adult height and rather large and "had fallen in with a group of college-aged kids who didn't realize how young Raymond was, and they let him tag along with them in activities and situations far too sophisticated for him to handle."<ref name=Ardmore>''[[The Modesto Bee]]'': [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5-EjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1dUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4231,2591366&dq=perry+mason+returns&hl=en Jane Ardmore "Welcome Home to Perry Mason", June 3, 1986], accessed March 26, 2010</ref> He developed a passion for growing things and, while still a teenager, joined the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] for a year.<ref name="Ardmore" /> Throughout his teenage years, he had some acting work, making his stage debut at age 12 with a [[Vancouver]] stock company.<ref name="Grimes" />

Burr may have served in the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], but never in the [[United States Navy]] as he and his publicists later claimed.<ref name="starr-58">Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 57–58. The [[National Personnel Records Center]] has no record of a Raymond Burr serving in any branch of the U.S. military.</ref> He had claimed he was seriously wounded in the stomach during the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in the latter stages of [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dXwoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YsoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=847,2133244&dq=raymond-burr+navy+wounded&hl=en | title=Raymond Burr Back At Work | author=Thomas, Bob | newspaper=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]] | date=February 12, 1963 | page=12 | authorlink=Bob Thomas (reporter)}}</ref> Other invented biographical details include years of college education at a variety of institutions, two marriages and a son who died as a teenager, world travel, an acting tour of the United Kingdom, and success in high school athletics.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 17, 20, 23–4, 40–1</ref> Such claims were accepted as fact by the press during his lifetime<ref name="Thomas" /><ref name="Grimes"/> and by his first biographer.<ref>Hill, ''Raymond Burr'', 27, [http://books.google.com/books?id=gmX_mIf32TAC&pg=PA27 available online].

==Early career==
In 1937, Burr began his acting career at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. In 1941, he landed his first Broadway role in ''Crazy with the Heat''. He became a contract player at [[RKO]] studio, playing a [[film noir]] [[villain]] in ''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1948).
In 1946, he had a regular part in [[Jack Webb]]'s first [[Old-time radio|radio]] show, ''[[Pat Novak for Hire]]'', playing Webb's nemesis Detective Heilman.
Burr appeared in over 60 movies between 1946 and 1957. In 1976, [[Richard Schickel]] cited his performance in ''[[Pitfall (1948 film)|Pitfall]]'' (1948) as a prototype of film noir in contrast with the appealing television characters for which Burr later became famous.<ref>Richard Schickel, "Rerunning Film Noir," ''The Wilson Quarterly'', vol. 31, no. 3, summer 2007, 43</ref> He received favorable notice for his role as an aggressive prosecutor in ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951), co-starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Montgomery Clift]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. Perhaps his best-known film role of the period was that of a suspected murderer in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), starring [[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]].<ref name="Thomas" /><ref name="Grimes" /> He played the part of reporter Steve Martin in ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'' (1956).<ref>Internet Movie Database: [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0197521/ Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956)], accessed July 14, 2011</ref>

Burr emerged as a prolific television character actor in the early to mid-1950s. He made his television debut on the April 24, 1952, episode "The Tiger" of ''[[Gruen Playhouse]]'' on the [[DuMont Television Network]]. (At about the same time, Burr guest-starred on an episode of ''[[The Amazing Mr. Malone]]'' on ABC.) This part led to other roles in such programs as ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'', ''[[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]] Sound Off Time'', ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', ''[[Mr. & Mrs. North]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]'', ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]'', and ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]''.

During this time, Burr's distinctive voice also could be heard on network radio, appearing alongside [[Jack Webb]] in the short-lived ''[[Pat Novak for Hire]]'' on ABC radio, as well as in early episodes of NBC's ''[[Dragnet (series)#Radio|Dragnet]]''.<ref name="MOB" /> He also made guest appearances on other Los Angeles-based shows, such as ''[[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]]'' and landed a starring role in [[CBS]]'s ''[[Fort Laramie (radio)|Fort Laramie]]'' (1956),<ref>Batz, Bob Radio Buff Savor the Glory Days. ''Dayton Daily News''. April 28, 1991. Retrieved March 27, 2010.</ref> which depicted 19th-century life at old Fort Laramie.<ref>''Fort Laramie'' was produced by the team that brought ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' to radio and was in a similar adult format. The 41 episodes all featured Raymond Burr as Lee Quince, captain of the cavalry.</ref> One year later, Burr became a television star as Perry Mason.

==''Perry Mason'' and ''Ironside''==
[[File:Raymond Burr Kathleen Crowley Perry Mason 1958.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Kathleen Crowley]] in ''Perry Mason'' (1958)]]
In 1956, Burr auditioned for the role of District Attorney [[Hamilton Burger]] in ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', a new CBS-TV courtroom drama based on the highly successful novels by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]. Impressed with his courtroom performance in the 1951 film, ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'', executive producer [[Gail Patrick|Gail Patrick Jackson]] told Burr he was perfect for Perry Mason but at least 60 pounds overweight. Over the next month Burr went on a crash diet. When he returned he tested as Perry Mason and won the role.<ref name="Bawden">{{cite web |url=http://www.classicimages.com/films_of_the_golden_ages/article_39f84018-cfc0-11e3-b0b4-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Dream Factory Time: Gail Patrick |last=Bawden |first=James  |date=April 29, 2014 |website=Classic Images |access-date=2015-04-23}}</ref> Gardner reportedly saw his audition and declared, "He is Perry Mason."<ref name="MOB" /> [[William Hopper]] also auditioned as Mason, but was instead cast as private detective [[Paul Drake (character)|Paul Drake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32898/perry-mason-50th-anniversary-edition/ |title=Perry Mason — 50th Anniversary Edition |last=Galbraith IV |first=Stuart |date=April 10, 2008 |website=[[DVD Talk]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-04-07}}</ref> Also starring were [[Barbara Hale]] as [[Della Street]], Mason's secretary; [[William Talman (actor)|William Talman]] as Burger, the district attorney who loses nearly every case to Mason; and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as homicide detective Lieutenant Arthur Tragg.<ref name="Bawden"/>

The series ran from 1957 to 1966, and Burr won Emmy Awards in 1959 and 1961<ref name="IMDB" /> for his performance as Perry Mason. The series has been re-run in syndication ever since. Beginning in 2006, the series has become available on DVD, with each calendar year seeing the release of one season as two separate volumes. The ninth and final season's DVD sets became available in 2013. Though Burr's character is often said never to have lost a case, he did lose two murder cases in early episodes of the series, once when his client misled him and another time when his client was later cleared.<ref name=nytbar />

In the early 1960s, Burr narrated one film and appeared in several others sponsored by the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]]. They were designed to educate the public about accident prevention.<ref>"An Assault on Accidents," ''American Journal of Nursing'', vol. 62, no. 12, December 1962, 68</ref>

Burr moved from CBS to [[Universal Studios]], where he played the title role in the television drama ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', which ran on NBC. In the pilot episode, [[San Francisco]] Chief of [[Detective]]s Robert T. Ironside is wounded by a sniper during an attempt on his life and is left an invalid in a wheelchair. This role gave Burr another hit series, the first [[crime drama]] show ever to star a disabled police officer. The show, which ran from 1967 to 1975, earned Burr six Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations.<ref name="IMDB" /> Burr's weight, always an issue for him in getting roles, became a public relations problem when [[Johnny Carson]] began making jokes about him during his ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on and told ''[[Us Weekly]]'' years later: "I have been asked a number of times to do his show and I won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC."<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 184</ref> In later life his distinctive physique and manner could be used as a reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer's opinion that "asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs...is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault."<ref>Verna Urbanski, "Fear and Loathing in Library Science," ''Journal of Education for Library and Information Science'', vol. 33, no. 1, winter 1992, 59. A character in a 1989 short story refers to Burr as "grossly overweight" in ''Ironsides''. Maxine Chernoff, "Death Swap, ''Mississippi Review'', vol. 18, no. 1, 1989, 77</ref>

NBC failed in two attempts to launch Burr as the star of a new series. In a two-hour television movie format, ''Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence'' aired in February 1976 with Burr again in the role of the lawyer who outwits the district attorney. Despite good reviews for Burr, the critical reception was poor and NBC decided against developing it into a series.<ref>Internet Movie Database:[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074847/  Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence (TV 1976)], accessed July 15, 2011; Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 177-8</ref> In 1977, Burr starred in the short-lived TV series ''[[Kingston: Confidential]]'' as R.

It was a critical failure that was scheduled opposite the extraordinarily popular ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.

By 1993, when Burr signed with NBC for another season of Mason films, he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health. In his final Perry Mason movie, ''The Case of the Killer Kiss'', which ironically was based on the final 60-minute episode, "The Case of the Final Fadeout," he was shown either sitting or standing while leaning on a table, but only once standing unsupported for a few seconds.<ref name="OConner">O'Conner, John J.

These include marriage to Scottish actress Annette Sutherland, supposedly killed in the same plane crash as [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]. A son, Michael Evan, was said to have resulted from another disputed possible marriage to Laura Andrina Morgan. Burr's account provided the only evidence of the boy's existence and death from leukemia at age 10.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 44-5, 113–4. Asked about Michael Evan, Isabella Ward said: "No, I never met him. Because there was no son."</ref> As late as 1991, Burr told ''Parade'' magazine that when he realized his son was dying, he took him on a one-year tour of the United States. He said, "Before my boy left, before his time was gone, I wanted him to see the beauty of his country and its people."<ref name="Thomas" /> His publicist knew that Burr worked in Hollywood throughout the year he said he was touring with his son.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sighrt'', 216</ref> As with Burr's claims to have served in the U.S. military, many of these fictions were believed and widely reported.<ref name="Grimes" /><ref>"Raymond Burr, 76, Dies of Cancer", ''Los Angeles Daily News'', September 14, 1993</ref>

In the late 1950s, Burr was rumored to be romantically involved with [[Natalie Wood]].<ref name="Podolsky" /> Wood's agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers and so that the men she dated could present themselves in public not as homosexuals. The dates also helped to disguise Wood's intimate relationship with [[Robert Wagner]], whom she later married.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 64-5, 67–70; Hofler, ''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson'', {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Burr felt enough attraction to Wood to resent [[Warner Bros.]]' decision to promote her attachment to [[Tab Hunter]] instead.

They were [[domestic partners|partners]] until Burr's death in 1993.<ref name=Murphy3443 /> Burr left Benevides his entire estate, including "all my jewelry, clothing, books, works of art,...and other items of a personal nature."<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 216-7</ref>

Later accounts of Burr's life explain that he hid his [[homosexuality]] to protect his career. In 2000, [[Associated Press|AP]] reporter [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]] recalled the situation:<ref name="Passport">[http://www.passportmagazine.com/businessclass/RobertBenevides.php?rand=1 Andrew Mersmann, "Robert Benevides: Raymond Burr Vineyards, Sonoma County, California," April 2008], accessed July 13, 2011</ref><ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 119; Finstad, ''Natasha'', ??: "It was the most devastating thing when [Natalie Wood] found that Raymond Burr was gay..."</ref>

{{quote|It was an open secret...that he was gay. He had a companion who was with him all the time. That was a time in Hollywood history when homosexuality was not countenanced. Ray was not a romantic star by any means, but he was a very popular figure...if it was revealed at that time in Hollywood history [that he was gay] it would have been very difficult for him to continue.}}

Art Marks, a producer of ''Perry Mason'', recalled Burr's talk of wives and children: "I know he was just putting on a show....That was my gut feeling. I think the wives and the loving women, the Natalie Wood thing, were a bit of a cover."<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 100</ref> In 2006, [[Dean Hargrove]], who worked on ''Perry Mason Returns'', said: "I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. I did know that I had trouble keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories. Raymond had the ability to mythologize himself, to some extent, and some of his stories about his past...tended to grow as time went by."<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 214. See also William J. Mann, ''Behind the Screen: How Lesbians and Gays Shaped Hollywood, 1910–1969'' (Viking, 2001), 313–4. Mann writes that [[Hedda Hopper]] received information from an informant in 1963 and wrote to Burr: "Dear Ray, What the hell did you do in Phoenix? If the enclosed letter is correct, this is the first intimation I've had of it." She did not repeat the enclosure's charges, but reassured Burr that if trouble developed he need only "call on the mother of Paul Drake and I will stand up and swear anything for you." Drake was a character on the ''Perry Mason'' television series played by Hopper's son [[William Hopper|William]].</ref>

A 2007 memoir by actor [[Paul Picerni]] described several experiences with Burr on the set of ''[[Mara Maru]]'', when he felt Burr expressed sexual interest in him. He wrote, "I saw him staring at me. With his big blue eyes. And with this strange expression on his face. For the first time in my life, I felt like a DAME. Then it hit me: He'd been giving me all this bullshit about his wife and his two kids in London, when in fact he was gay, and he was makin' a move on me!" He remembered Burr "was a great guy and very subtle in his homosexuality."<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 52-3; Paul Picerni, ''Steps to Stardom: My Story'' (Bearmanor Press, 2007), ??</ref>

===Hobbies===
Burr had many hobbies over the course of his life: cultivating orchids, collecting wine, art, stamps, and [[seashell]]s.  He was very fond of cooking.<ref name="Grimes">{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/obituaries/raymond-burr-actor-76-dies-played-perry-mason-and-ironside.html | title=Raymond Burr, Actor, 76, Dies; Played Perry Mason and Ironside | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | author=Grimes, William | date= September 14, 1993 | accessdate=2007-01-15 | authorlink= William Grimes (Author)}}</ref> As a dedicated [[seashell]] collector, his financial support and gift of [[cowries]] and [[Cone snail|cones]] from [[Fiji]] helped to create the [[Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum]] in [[Sanibel, Florida]].<ref>http://shellmuseum.org/Memorial_Garden.cfm</ref> He was also interested in flying, sailing, and fishing. According to [[A&E Biography]], Burr was an avid reader with a retentive memory. He was also among the earliest importers and breeders of [[Portuguese Water Dog]]s in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Complete Portuguese Water Dog|first=Kathryn|last=Braund|publisher=Howell Bk|year=1997|isbn=0-87605-262-6}}</ref>
[[File:RaymondBurrVineyards.jpg|thumb|240px|Raymond Burr Vineyards]]
He developed his interest in cultivating and hybridizing [[orchid]]s into a business with Benevides. Over 20 years, their company, Sea God Nurseries, had nurseries in [[Fiji]], [[Hawaii]], the [[Azores]], and [[California]], and was responsible for adding more than 1,500 new orchids to the worldwide catalog.<ref name="Passport" /> Burr named one of them the "Barbara Hale Orchid" after his ''Perry Mason'' costar.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/02/23/SPECIAL15263.dt | title=Not all attractions in Bay Area cost a small fortune | publisher=San Francisco Examiner |author=Kristine M.

Together Burr and Benevides cultivated [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Chardonnay]], and [[Port wine|Port]] grapes, as well as orchids, at Burr's farmland holdings in [[Sonoma County, California]]. After Burr's death, Benevides named the property after Burr. The land is still in production and is known as the Raymond Burr Vineyards.

In 1965, Burr purchased the [[Naitamba Island|Naitauba]], a {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} island in Fiji, rich in seashells. There, he and Benevides oversaw the raising of [[copra]] (coconut meat) and cattle, as well as orchids.<ref name="Passport" /><ref name="Raymond Burr Vineyards History" /> Burr planned to retire there permanently. However, medical problems made that impossible and he sold the property in 1983.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 149-53, 167–8, 172, 181, 186; {{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/11/AR2005061100724.html |title=Deep Throat's Daughter, The Kindred Free Spirit |publisher=Washington Post |date= June 12, 2005|accessdate=March 30, 2010 | first=Lynne | last=Duke}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
Burr was a well-known philanthropist.<ref>Hill, ''Raymond Burr'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=gmX_mIf32TAC&pg=PA149 p. 149].</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5202/is_1989/ai_n19121827/pg_2 |title=United Service Organizations |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-03-30 | first=A. | last=Woodward}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gloubik.info/burr/anglais/life.html |title=Raymond Burr's life |publisher=Gloubik.info |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref><ref name="shells">{{Cite web|url=http://shellmuseum.org/docs/articles/39/Shellnews_59.pdf |title=TSM 63285 0610 Newsletter_r |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> He gave enormous sums of money, including his salaries from the Perry Mason movies, to charity. He was also known for sharing his wealth with friends. He sponsored 26 foster children through the [[Plan (aid organisation)|Foster Parents' Plan]] or [[Save The Children]], many with the greatest medical needs.<ref name="Ardmore" /> He also gave money and some of his Perry Mason scripts to the [[McGeorge School of Law]] in [[Sacramento, California]].<ref name="shells" />

Burr raised money for the [[Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum]] in [[Sanibel, Florida]], and also donated a considerable collection of Fijian cowries and cones from his island in the Fijis.<ref name="shells" /> In 1993, Sonoma State University awarded Burr an honorary doctorate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sonoma.edu/uaffairs/notables/entertainment.html |title=Entertainment |publisher=Sonoma.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> He supported medical and education institutions in Denver, and in 1993, the [[University of Colorado]] awarded him an honorary doctorate for his acting work.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 197-8</ref> Burr also founded and financed the American Fijian Foundation that funded academic research, including efforts to develop a dictionary of the language.<ref>Albert J. Schütz and Tevita Nawadra, "A Refutation of the Notion 'Passive' in Fijian", ''Oceanic Linguistics'', vol. 11, no. 2, winter 1972, 107; Albert J. Schutz, "The Forerunners of the Fijian Dictionary", ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'', vol. 83, no. 4, December 1974, 443</ref>

Burr made repeated trips on behalf of the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO). He toured both [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]]. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of [[Greenland]], [[Baffinland]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 53-7</ref> Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, "My only position on the war is that I wish it were over."<ref name=starr1601>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 160-1</ref> In October 1967, NBC aired ''Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam'', a documentary of one of his visits that received mixed reviews, ranging from "The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing" (''[[Chicago Tribune]]'') to "His questions...were intelligent and elicited some interesting replies." (''[[Los Angeles Times]]'').<ref name=starr1601 />

Burr had a reputation in Hollywood as a thoughtful, generous man years before much of his more-visible philanthropic work. In 1960, [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], who portrayed Lt. Arthur Tragg on the original ''Perry Mason'' series, and who was by that time often ill and unable to remember all the lines he was supposed to speak, stated, "There is nothing but kindness from our star, Ray Burr. Part of his life is dedicated to us, and that's no bull. If there's anything the matter with any of us, he comes around before anyone else and does what he can to help. He's a great star — in the old tradition."<ref>Hollywood column by Rick Du Brow for United Press International, appearing in the State Times Advocate of Baton Rouge LA, July 19, 1960, p. 5</ref>

==Illness and death==
During the filming of his last Perry Mason movie in the spring of 1993, Raymond Burr fell ill.  A Viacom spokesperson told the media that the illness might be related to the malignant kidney that Burr had removed that February.<ref name="Ill" /> It was determined that the cancer had spread to his liver and was at that point inoperable.<ref name="Stevenson">Stevenson, Jennifer. Raymond Burr Dies of Cancer. St. Petersburg Times. September 14, 1993. Accessed on march 27,2010</ref> Burr threw several "goodbye parties" before his death on September 12, 1993, at his [[Sonoma County, California]], ranch near Healdsburg.<ref name="Grimes" /> He was 76 years old.

Burr was [[interred]] with his parents at Fraser Cemetery, [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  On October 1, 1993, a gathering of about 600 family members and friends of Burr mourned him at a memorial service at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]].<ref>''Southland Briefly''. Daily News of Los Angeles. October 2, 1993. Retrieved March 27, 2010.</ref> The private memorial was attended by Robert Benevides, [[Barbara Hale]], [[Don Galloway]], [[Don Mitchell (actor)|Don Mitchell]], [[Barbara Anderson (actress)|Barbara Anderson]], Elizabeth Baur, [[Dean Hargrove]], [[William R. Moses]], and [[Christian I. Nyby II]].

R. William Ide III, president of the [[American Bar Association]], paid tribute to the way Burr's ''Perry Mason'' presented lawyers "in a professional and dignified manner" and helped "to educate many people who previously had not had access to the justice system." Though lawyers once complained of the character's implausibly perfect track record, Ide complimented Burr because he "strove for such authenticity in his courtroom characterizations that we regard his passing as though we lost one of our own."<ref name=nytbar>''New York Times'': [David Margolick, "At the Bar: Raymond Burr's Perry Mason was fictional, but he was surely relevant and, oh, so competent," September 24, 1993], accessed July 15, 2011</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' added that Mason "made the [[presumption of innocence]] real...[and] also made lawyers look good.<ref name=nytbar /> Not long before Burr died, Mason was named second after [[F. Lee Bailey]] in a poll that asked Americans to name the attorney, fictional or not, they most admired.<ref name=nytbar />

Because Burr had not revealed his homosexuality during his lifetime, initial press accounts gave it sensational treatment. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' reported that ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine was preparing a story on Burr's "secret life" and asked, "Are the inevitable rumors true?"<ref name="Podolsky" /><ref name="Post-Gazette">{{cite news |section=People/Television |title=For the Defense |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=September 21, 1993 |page=D6 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}</ref> Burr's ''Ironside'' co-star, [[Don Galloway]], when asked about Burr's sexual orientation, told ''People'', "I don't know. I never discussed with Raymond his sexuality." The ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' invented a feminine Burr "wearing a pink frilly apron and doing the ironing. He fussed around like the woman of the house."<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 216.</ref>

Burr bequeathed his estate to Robert Benevides and excluded all relatives, including a sister, nieces, and nephews. His will was challenged by a niece and nephew, Minerva and James, the children of his late brother, James E. Burr, without success.<ref>Starr, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'', 216-8.</ref> The tabloids estimated that the estate was worth $32 million, but Benevides' attorney, John Hopkins, said that was an overestimate.<ref name="Estate">{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zD8jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WuoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1310,3573096&dq=raymond+burr%27s+estate&hl=en |title=Legal Fight Erupts over Burr's Estate |work=Gainesville Sun |date=February 14, 1994 |accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=Bay Area Reporter |url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=3117 |first=Ed |last=Walsh |title=Burr, in the closet during TV career, comes to life in new book |date=June 26, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}</ref>

==Recognition==
Burr won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor - Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Drama Series]] twice, in 1959 and 1961, for his performance as Perry Mason. He was also nominated a further seven times, once for ''Mason'' and six times for ''Ironside''. For the latter role, he was also nominated twice for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama]].

The [[Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] in Lansing, Michigan, awards the Raymond Burr Award for Excellence in Criminal Law.<ref name=nytbar />

Burr has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6656 [[Hollywood Blvd]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame: |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/raymond-burr |title=Raymond Burr |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}</ref>

The Raymond Burr Performing Arts Centre in [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]], opened in October 2000, near a city block bearing the Burr family name, and closed in 2006.  Originally a movie theatre, under ownership of the [[Famous Players]] chain (as the Columbia Theatre), it was an intimate, 238-seat theater. Initial plans included expanding the venue to a 650-seat regional performing arts facility.  When in operation, it was the custom to have a picture of Raymond Burr included somewhere on each set, with the first toast on the opening night of every production always dedicated to his memory.  The Centre was commonly referred to as the "Burr Theatre," or simply as "the Burr". It is owned by the City of New Westminster, which placed it for sale on 15 June 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/9350/ |title=Raymond Burr Performing Arts Centre |publisher=cinematreasures.org}}</ref>
