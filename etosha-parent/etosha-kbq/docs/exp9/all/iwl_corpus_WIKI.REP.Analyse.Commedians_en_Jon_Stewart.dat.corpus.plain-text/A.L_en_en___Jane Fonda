'''Jane Fonda''' (born '''Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda''';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/161282%7C0/Jane-Fonda-8-23.html|title=Jane Fonda Profile|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> December 21, 1937) is an American actress, writer, [[political activism|political activist]], former [[fashion model]] and [[Physical fitness|fitness]] [[guru]]. She is a two-time [[Academy Award]] winner. In 2014, she was the recipient of the [[American Film Institute]] [[AFI Life Achievement Award]].

Fonda made her [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] debut in the 1960 play ''[[There Was a Little Girl]]'', for which she received the first of two [[Tony Award]] nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year in ''[[Tall Story]]''. She rose to fame in  1960s films such as ''[[Period of Adjustment (film)|Period of Adjustment]]'' (1962), ''[[Sunday in New York]]'' (1963), ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1967) and ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968). Her first husband was ''Barbarella'' director [[Roger Vadim]]. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They]]'' (1969) and went on to win two [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] Oscars in the 1970s for ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) and ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' (1978). Her other nominations were for ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Morning After (1986 film)|The Morning After]]'' (1986). Her other major competitive awards include an [[Emmy Award]] for the 1984 TV film ''[[The Dollmaker]]'', two [[BAFTA Awards]] for ''Julia'' and ''The China Syndrome'' and four [[Golden Globe Awards]].

In 1982, she released her first exercise video, ''Jane Fonda's Workout'', which became the highest-selling video of the time. It would be the first of 22 workout videos released by her over the next 13 years which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from second husband [[Tom Hayden]], she married billionaire [[media mogul]] [[Ted Turner]] in 1991 and retired from acting. Divorced from Turner in 2001, she returned to acting with her first film in 15 years with the 2005 comedy ''[[Monster in Law]]''. Subsequent films have included ''[[Georgia Rule]]'' (2007), ''[[The Butler]]'' (2013) and ''[[This Is Where I Leave You]]'' (2014).  In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 45-year absence, in the play ''[[33 Variations]]'', which earned her a  Tony Award nomination, while her recurring role in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]'' (2012-2014), has earned her two Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2010 and 2012.

Fonda has been an activist for many political causes. Her [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era]] opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] included her being photographed sitting on an [[anti-aircraft battery]] on a 1972 visit to [[Hanoi]], which was very controversial. She has also protested the [[Iraq War]] and violence against women, and  describes herself as a [[feminist]]. In 2005, she, [[Robin Morgan]] and [[Gloria Steinem]] co-founded the [[Women's Media Center]], an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda currently serves on the board of the organization. She published an autobiography in 2005. In 2011, she published a second memoir, ''Prime Time''.

==Background==
[[File:Henry Fonda and Jane - 1943.jpg|thumb|Jane with father, Navy Lieutenant [[Henry Fonda]] (1943)]]
Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda was born on December 21, 1937, in New York City, the daughter of actor [[Henry Fonda]] and the Canadian-born socialite [[Frances Ford Seymour|Frances Ford Brokaw, née Seymour]]. According to her father, their surname came from Italian ancestors who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s.<ref>Henry Fonda, ''My Life'', New York: Dutton, 1981.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> There, they intermarried and began to use Dutch given names, with Jane's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650.<ref>The Fonda immigrant ancestor came from [[Eagum]] (also spelled Augum or Agum), a village in [[Friesland]], a northern province of the Netherlands. Jellis Douwe Fonda (1614–1659), a Dutch immigrant from [[Friesland]] (or Vrysland), immigrated and first went to Beverwyck (now [[Albany, New York|Albany]]) in 1650; he was the founder of the City of [[Fonda, New York]] (see {{cite web|url=http://www.fonda.org|title=Descendants of Jellis Douw Fonda (1614–1659)|publisher=fonda.org}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/peter-fonda/index.html|publisher=[[genealogy.com]]|title=Ancestry of Peter Fonda|archivedate=March 15, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120315121423/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/peter-fonda/index.html}}</ref><ref>''Jane: an intimate biography of Jane Fonda'', Thomas Kiernan, Putnam, 1973, p. 12</ref><ref>''Citizen Jane: The Turbulent Life of Jane Fonda'', [[Christopher P.

She was named for the third wife of [[Henry VIII]], [[Jane Seymour]], to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side.<ref>Fonda, 2005, p. 41.</ref> She has a brother, [[Peter Fonda|Peter]], an actor, and a maternal half-sister, Frances (aka "Pan").<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3562051/Pilar-Corrias-a-new-gallery-for-a-new-era.html|location=London|title=Pilar Corrias: a new gallery for a new era|first=Jo|last=Craven|date=October 12, 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

On April 14, 1950, when Fonda was twelve, her mother committed [[suicide]] while under treatment at a psychiatric hospital.<ref>Fonda, 2005, pp. 16–17.</ref> Later that year, Fonda's father married socialite [[Susan Blanchard (socialite)|Susan Blanchard]] (born 1928), just nine years his daughter's senior; this marriage ended in divorce. At 15 Fonda taught dance at [[Fire Island Pines, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fireislandnews.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=419&Itemid=77&date=2008-07-01|title=SAGE Nets $35K at Annual Pines Fête|publisher=Fire Island News|date=June 25, 2008|archivedate=December 5, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081205111202/http://fireislandnews.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=419&Itemid=77&date=2008-07-01}}</ref> She attended [[Greenwich Academy]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].

==Acting career==
Fonda became interested in acting in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of ''The Country Girl'', at the [[Omaha Community Playhouse]].<ref name="Browne2001"/> After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for two years to study art.<ref name="Bosworth">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year= 2011|ISBN=0-547-50447-0|page=98}}</ref> Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met [[Lee Strasberg]] and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, "I went to the [[Actors Studio]] and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father — who had to say so — told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!"<ref>Foster, Arnold W., and Blau, Judith R. ''Art and Society: Readings in the Sociology of the Arts'', SUNY Press (1989) pp. 118–119. ISBN 978-0-7914-0116-3.</ref>

===1960s===
Her stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with ''[[Tall Story]]'', in which she recreated one of her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by [[Anthony Perkins]]. ''[[Period of Adjustment (film)|Period of Adjustment]]'' and ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' followed in 1962. In ''Walk on the Wild Side'' Fonda played a prostitute, and earned a [[Golden Globe]] for Most Promising Newcomer.

[[File:Jane Fonda - publicity.JPG|thumb|left|Fonda in 1963]]
In 1963, she appeared in ''[[Sunday in New York]]''. ''[[Newsday]]'' called her "the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses".<ref>[33-preludes-to-33-variations-the-early-broadway-years-of-jane-fonda 33 Preludes to 33 Variations: The Early Broadway Years of Jane Fonda ]</ref> However, she also had detractors—in the same year, the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' named her the "Year's Worst Actress" for ''[[The Chapman Report]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19630406&id=kEc0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=qGUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3613,1057920|title=Harvard Lampoon Lampoons Films|date=April 6, 1963|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> Fonda's career breakthrough came with ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy [[Western (genre)|Western]] received five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to [[bankable]] stardom. After this came the comedies ''[[Any Wednesday]]'' (1966) and ''[[Barefoot in the Park (film)|Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1967), the latter co-starring [[Robert Redford]].

In 1968, she played the title role in the [[science fiction]] spoof ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', which established her status as a [[sex symbol]]. In contrast, the tragedy ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' (1969) won her critical acclaim, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role. Fonda was very selective by the end of the 1960s, turning down lead roles in ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' and ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', which went to [[Mia Farrow]] and [[Faye Dunaway]], respectively.

===1970s===
Fonda won her first [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1971, again playing a prostitute, the [[gamine]] Bree Daniels, in the murder mystery ''[[Klute]]''. She won her second Oscar in 1978 for ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'', the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life.<ref name="actors">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''</ref>

Between ''Klute'' in 1971 and ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun With Dick and Jane]]'' in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in ''[[A Doll's House (1973 Losey film)|A Doll's House]]'' (1973), ''[[Steelyard Blues]]'' and ''[[The Blue Bird (1976 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted."<ref>[http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/janefonda/ Jane Fonda profile]. ''Hello! Magazine''; retrieved April 2, 2006.</ref> However, in her 2005 autobiography, ''My Life So Far'', she rejected such simplification. ''"The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed."''<ref>Fonda, 2005, p. 378</ref> She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.

In 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside [[Yves Montand]] in ''[[Tout Va Bien]]'', directed by [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]]. The two directors then made ''[[Letter to Jane]]'', in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda.

Through her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun With Dick and Jane]]'' is generally considered her "comeback" picture. She also received positive reviews, [[BAFTA]] and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress, and an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] in the 1977 film ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]''.<ref name="actors"/> During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' because she felt the part was not relevant. She followed with popular and successful films such as ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), about a cover-up of an accident in a [[nuclear power plant]]; and ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979) with her previous co-star, [[Robert Redford]].

===1980s===
In 1980, Fonda starred in ''[[Nine to Five]]'' with [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1980 1980 Yearly Box Office Results. ''[[boxofficemojo.com]]'']</ref> Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship.<ref name="actors" /> She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]],'' specifically for her father and her.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Barbarella-comes-of-age/2005/05/12/1115843302558.html "Barbarella comes of age"], ''[[The Age]]'', May 14, 2005; retrieved May 5, 2008. "If Barbarella was an act of rebellion, On Golden Pond (1981) was a more mature rapprochement: Fonda bought the rights to Ernest Thompson's play to offer the role to her father."</ref> ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'', which also starred [[Katharine Hepburn]], brought Henry Fonda his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.<ref name="actors"/>

Fonda continued appearing in feature films throughout the 1980s, most notably in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in ''[[Agnes of God (film)|Agnes of God]]'' (1985). She was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of an [[alcoholic]] murder suspect in the 1986 thriller ''[[The Morning After (1986 film)|The Morning After]]'', opposite [[Jeff Bridges]]. She ended the decade by appearing in ''[[Old Gringo]]''. This was followed by the romantic drama ''[[Stanley & Iris]]'' (1990) with [[Robert De Niro]], which would be her final film for 15 years.

====Exercise videos====
For many years Fonda took [[ballet]] class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming ''The China Syndrome'', she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in [[aerobics]] and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The ''Leni Workout'' became the ''Jane Fonda Workout,'' which began a second career for her, continuing for many years.<ref name="actors"/> This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among [[baby boomers]], then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled ''Jane Fonda's Workout'', inspired by her best-selling book, ''[[Jane Fonda's Workout Book]]''. ''Jane Fonda's Workout'' became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new [[VCR]] in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series.<ref name="actors"/> She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/jane-fonda-back-leotard-72-iconic-actress-fitness-guru-debut-new-fitness-dvds-article-1.438610|title=Jane Fonda is back in her leotard, at 72; iconic actress and fitness guru to debut new fitness DVDs|last=Goldwert|first=Lindsay|date=September 14, 2010|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|accessdate=July 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Political activism==
During the 1960s, Fonda engaged in [[political activism]] in support of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]], and in [[opposition to the Vietnam War]].<ref name="actors"/> Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as "small-c communism".<ref>Fonda, 2005, p. 139</ref> Along with other celebrities, she supported the [[Alcatraz Island]] occupation by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in 1969, which was intended to call attention to failures of the government in treaty rights and the movement for greater Indian sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/occupation.html|title=Alcatraz is Not an Island|publisher=PBS|year=2002}}</ref>

She supported [[Huey Newton]] and the [[Black Panthers]] in the early 1970s, stating "Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood." She called the Black Panthers "our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, [[propaganda]] and risk."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Black Panthers|work=[[Socialist Worker#United Kingdom|Socialist Worker]]|location=London, UK|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=10386|date= January 6, 2007}}</ref> She has been involved in the [[feminism|feminist]] movement since the 1970s, which dovetails with her activism in support of [[civil rights]].

===Opposition to Vietnam War===
{{See also|Opposition to the Vietnam War|RITA Resistance Inside the Armies#Jane Fonda and RITA}}
[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|Jane Fonda at an anti-Vietnam War conference in The Hague in January 1975]]
In April 1970, Fonda, with [[Fred Gardner (activist)|Fred Gardner]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] formed the [[Free The Army tour|FTA tour]] ("Free The Army", a play on the troop expression "Fuck The Army"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to [[Bob Hope]]'s [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour. The tour, described as "political [[vaudeville]]" by Fonda, visited military towns along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (''F.T.A.'') which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemen and servicewomen; it was released in 1972.<ref>[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=2376 Rotten Tomatoes profile of ''F.T.A.'']; retrieved April 2, 2006.</ref>

On May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the [[University of New Mexico]], in Albuquerque, to speak on GI rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence. The quiet was broken when [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Gregory Corso]] staggered onto the stage. Drunk, Corso challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: Why hadn't she addressed the [[Kent State shootings|shooting of four students at Kent State]] by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident: "I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool." On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president, Ferrel Heady. The protestors called themselves "They Shoot Students, Don't They?" — a reference to Fonda's recently released film, ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'', which had just had been screened in Albuquerque.<ref name="Bosworth">Bosworth, p. 315</ref>

In the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] (VVAW) in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]]. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and, for her efforts, was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5hq2_JFvV0kC&dq=%22jane+fonda%22+%22honorary+national+coordinator%22+-wikipedia&client=firefox-a|title=Home to war: a history of the Vietnam veterans' movement|last=Nicosia|first=Gerald|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7867-1403-2|publisher=Carroll & Graf|page=73}}</ref> On November 3, 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fonda was a "major patron" of the VVAW. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====Controversial visit to Hanoi====
[[File:Hanoi Jane.jpg|thumb|Jane Fonda on the NVA anti-aircraft gun]]
Fonda visited [[Hanoi]] in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been [[Bombing of Vietnam's dikes|intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River]]. Columnist [[Joseph Kraft]], who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were "truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879148,00.html|title=The Battle of the Dikes|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 7, 1972|accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref>

Fonda was photographed seated on a North Vietnamese [[anti-aircraft battery]]; the controversial photo outraged a number of Americans,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Jane Fonda relives her protest days on the set of her new film|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7911158/Jane-Fonda-relives-her-protest-days-on-the-set-of-her-new-film.html|date=July 26, 2010|first=Laura|last=Roberts|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> and earned her the nickname "Hanoi Jane".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/23/list-top-10-jane-fonda-mistakes/ |work=Washington Times |title=Jane Fonda mistakes |date=23 December 2012 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures and regretted they were taken. In a 2011 entry at her official website, Fonda explained:
<blockquote>It happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit&nbsp;... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: ''"All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness."'' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. ''These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.'' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return&nbsp;... I memorized a song called "Day Ma Di", written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me&nbsp;... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed&nbsp;... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen&nbsp;... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever&nbsp;... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.<ref name=truth2011july>[http://janefonda.com/the-truth-about-my-trip-to-hanoi "The Truth About My Trip To Hanoi"].

Fonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, commenting on her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories damaged in the war and denouncing U.S. military policy in Vietnam. Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam and her radio broadcasts.<ref>{{cite book|title=My Life So Far|first=Jane|last=Fonda|publisher=Random House|year=2005|ISBN=978-1-588-36478-4|page=324}}</ref><ref name="snopes2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/military/fonda.asp|title=Hanoi'd with Jane|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|date=May 25, 2005|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}</ref> During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American [[prisoners of war]] (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda called the returning POWs "hypocrites and liars and pawns", adding about the prisoners she visited, "These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed."<ref>Andersen, p. 266.</ref> In addition, Fonda told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1973, "I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture&nbsp;... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie."<ref>{{cite news|title=Jane Fonda Grants Some P.O.W.

Fonda has personally denied the rumors.<ref name=truth2011july/> Interviews with two of the alleged victims specifically named in the emails showed these allegations to be false as they had never met Fonda.<ref name="snopes2005"/>

In 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwluherstory.com/indochina-peace-campaign.html|title=Indochina Peace Campaign|publisher=The Chicago Women's Liberation Union Herstory Project|work=Womankind|date=November 1972|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}</ref> continued to mobilize antiwar activists across the nation after the 1973 [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Agreement]], through 1975, when the United States withdrew from Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indochina Peace Campaign, Boston Office: Records, 1972–1975 |url=http://www.lib.umb.edu/node/1607|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>

Because of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when [[U.S. Naval Academy]] plebes, who weren't even born when Fonda protested the Vietnam war, shouted out "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the entire company replied "Goodnight, bitch!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/Brush/fonda.html|title=Hating Jane: The American Military and Jane Fonda|last=Brush|first=Peter|publisher=Vanderbilt University|year=2004|archivedate=April 4, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100404102645/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/brush/fonda.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N4TMYCIt5ywC&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=%22good+night+jane+fonda%22&source=bl&ots=DXbshAF4jz&sig=9x_VTeK4Xk_n9WqL4rVL4sMIr6M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cP9cVPeGEIShNpmtgrgJ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=%22good%20night%20jane%20fonda%22&f=false|isbn=978-0-19-518172-2|first=Steven J.|last=Ross|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=229|chapter=Movement Leader, Grassroots Builder: Jane Fonda|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}</ref> This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's ''Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601000000*/http://www.usna.edu/Commandant/Instructions/COMDTMIDNINST_3120.1J_PLEBE_SUMMER_STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES.pdf|publisher=United States Naval Academy|accessdate=April 14, 2013|pages=4–5|format=PDF|date=March 13, 2013}}</ref> In 2005, Michael A.

====Regrets====
In a 1988 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:<blockquote>I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Barbara Walters|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html#aftermath|publisher=UC Berkeley Library Sound Recording Project|year=1988|accessdate=February 16, 2008}}</ref></blockquote>

Some critics responded that her apology came at a time when a group of New England Veterans had launched a campaign to disrupt a film project she was working on, leading to the charge that her apology was motivated at least partly by self-interest.<ref name="snopes2005"/><ref>Goldberg, Jonah (June 23, 2000). [http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/jonah062300.asp "If Fonda is sorry, let her say so"]. ''Jewish World Review''.</ref>

In a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a "betrayal" of American forces and of the "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as [[propaganda]] and pride for her anti-war activism: "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/31/60minutes/main684295_page2.shtml|title=Jane Fonda: Wish I Hadn't|publisher=CBS|work=60 minutes|accessdate=February 16, 2008|date=March 31, 2005}}</ref>

====Subject of government surveillance====
In 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) as part of [[Project Minaret]], a program that some NSA officials have described as "disreputable if not downright illegal".<ref name=nsarchive-2013>{{cite web|title=Disreputable if Not Outright Illegal': The National Security Agency versus Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, Art Buchwald, Frank Church, et al.|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441|work=National Security Archive|publisher=George Washington University|editor=Burr, William|editor2=Aid, Matthew M.|date=September 25, 2013 [November 14, 2008]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130926223814/http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441/|archivedate=September 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=pilkington-2013>{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|title=Declassified NSA files show agency spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk|accessdate=September 26, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=September 26, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6JvNdF5AX|archivedate=September 26, 2013}}</ref> Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, [[Tom Hayden]], were intercepted by Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).

===Feminist causes===
Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', of which she is an honorary chairperson. She was present at their first summit in 2002, bringing together founder [[Eve Ensler]], Afghan women oppressed by the [[Taliban]], and a [[Kenya]]n activist campaigning to save girls from [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vday.org/static/presskit/2007OnlinePressKit.pdf |format=PDF|title=V-Day's 2007 Press Kit|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}</ref>

In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gynob.emory.edu/jfc_prog_teenservices.cfm|title=Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health|publisher=Emory University, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics|accessdate=February 3, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051111100335/http://gynob.emory.edu/jfc_prog_teenservices.cfm|archivedate=November 11, 2005}}</ref>

On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through [[Ciudad Juárez]], with [[Sally Field]], [[Eve Ensler]] and other women, urging [[Mexico]] to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/10/entertainment/main1604992.shtml|title=Actresses Speak Out in Mexico City|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=February 15, 2008|date=May 10, 2006}}</ref> That same year, she served as a mentor to the first ever all-[[transsexual]] cast of ''The Vagina Monologues''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Beautiful%20Daughters/Beautiful%20Daughters.html|title=Beautiful Daughters|author=Josh Aronson and Ariel Orr Jordan}}</ref>

In the days before the September 17, 2006 [[Sweden|Swedish]] elections, Fonda went to [[Sweden]] to support the new political party [[Feministiskt initiativ]] in their election campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.se/se/article/2006/09/15/13/5501-23/index.xml|title=Jane Fonda FI:s galjonsfigur för en dag|publisher=Metro International|accessdate=February 15, 2008|date=September 9, 2006|language=Swedish}}</ref>

In ''My Life So Far'', Fonda stated that she considers [[patriarchy]] to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were "anti-male". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she "still loves men", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.<ref>Fonda, ''My Life So Far''.<!-- pages?? --></ref>

===Native Americans===
Fonda went to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by [[Bernie Whitebear]]. The group had occupied part of the grounds of [[Fort Lawton]], which was in the process of being surplussed by the [[United States Army]] and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local [[urban Indian]] population, protesting that "Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tizon|first=Alex|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971202&slug=2575788|title=Facing The End, Activist Reflects On Life's Victories|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 2, 1997|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref> The endeavor succeeded and the [[Daybreak Star Cultural Center]] was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.<ref>Whitebear, Bernie.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
In December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the [[West Bank]] as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with [[Women in Black]] against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip]] outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to [[Ramallah]] to see a physical rehabilitation center, and a Palestinian refugee camp.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2595375.stm "Fonda joins Jerusalem demo"].

Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]] of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] stated that "People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel."<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/16/toronto-festival-israel-tel-aviv US actor Jane Fonda backs away from Israel row at Toronto film festival]; The Guardian; September 16, 2009</ref>  Hier continued, saying that "it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas."<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/comment/article/693960 "To criticize Israel is a dangerous thing in today's Canada"].

Fonda, in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." She continued, writing "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens."<ref name="FondaHP2009">Fonda, Jane (September 15, 2009).

===Opposition to the Iraq War===
{{See also|Opposition to the Iraq War}}
Fonda argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some of the war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jane Fonda to oppose Iraq war on bus tour |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-07-25-fonda_x.htm|date=July 25, 2005|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> She later canceled the tour, due to concerns that she would distract attention from [[Cindy Sheehan]]'s activism.<ref>Friedman, Roger (September 7, 2005), [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,168646,00.html "Fonda Puts Brakes on Bus Tour"], FOX News; retrieved April 2, 2006.</ref>

In September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist [[George Galloway]] at two stops on his U.S. book tour, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] and [[Chicago]]. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jane stands up Gorgeous George|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article570563.ece|date=September 25, 2005|first=Sarah|last=Baxter|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref>

On January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., declaring that "silence is no longer an option".<ref>{{cite news|title=War protesters demand U.S. troop withdrawal|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16841070|date=January 27, 2007|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> Fonda spoke at an anti-war rally earlier in the day at the [[United States Navy Memorial|Navy Memorial]], where members of the organization [[Free Republic]] picketed in a counter protest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thousands Protest Bush Policy| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/27/AR2007012700629_2.html|date=January 28, 2007|first=Michael|last=Ruane|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=2| first2=Fredrick|last2=Kunkle|lastauthoramp=yes|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref>

===Fonda and Kerry===
In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], her name was used as a disparaging epithet against [[John Kerry]], the former [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War|VVAW]] leader, who was then the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] presidential candidate. [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican National Committee]] Chairman [[Ed Gillespie]] called Kerry a "Jane Fonda Democrat". Also, Kerry's opponents circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, although they were sitting several rows apart.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry.asp " Does a photograph show Senator John Kerry at a 1970 anti-war rally?"] Snopes; retrieved April 2, 2006.</ref> A faked composite photograph, which gave the false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry2.asp "Does a photograph show Senator John Kerry and Jane Fonda sharing a speaker's platform at an anti-war rally?"] Snopes.com; retrieved April 2, 2006.</ref>

==Writing==
On April 5, 2005, [[Random House]] released Fonda's autobiography ''My Life So Far''.  The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third "act" will be her most significant, due in part to her commitment to the Christian religion, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.<ref>{{cite book|title=My life so far|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3w5lAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0375507108|publisher=Random House|year=2005|ISBN=978-1-588-36478-4}}</ref>

Fonda's autobiography was well received by book critics, and was noted to be "as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself" in its ''[[Washington Post]]'' review, pronouncing her a "beautiful bundle of contradictions".<ref>{{cite news |title=First Person, Singular |first=Jonathan |last=Yardley |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26664-2005Apr4.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 5, 2005}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the book "achingly poignant".<ref name="nytreview">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/books/review/24DOWDL.html|title={{'-}}My Life So Far': The Roles of a Lifetime|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|date=April 24, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>

In January 2009, Fonda started chronicling her Broadway return in a blog, with posts ranging from her Pilates class to her fears and excitement about her new play. She uses [[Twitter]] and has a [[Facebook]] page.<ref>{{cite news|author=Marianne Schnall|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marianne-schnall/jane-fonda-on-joining-the_b_179773.html|title=Jane Fonda on Joining the Blogosphere|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=April 16, 2009}}</ref> In 2011, Fonda published a new book: ''Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit—making the most of all of your life''. The book offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls "the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond".<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Time-fitness-friendship-spirit--making/dp/1400066972/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1315069190&sr=1-1 Amazon.com], ''Prime Time'', August 2011, Random House; ISBN 1-4000-6697-2.</ref>
