In 2002, Richardson was cast as new lead in the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] medical drama series ''[[Strong Medicine]]'', as Dr. Andy Campbell (née March).<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelleher |first=Terry |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138003,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Review: Talking With...Patricia Richardson |publisher=People.com |date=2002-09-23 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref> She replaced [[Janine Turner]], who left the show.

In 2010, she appeared in an NBC made for TV film, ''[[The Jensen Project]]'', and in 2011, she appeared in the Lifetime TV film ''Bringing Ashley Home'', also starring [[AJ Cook]] and [[Jennifer Morrison]].
