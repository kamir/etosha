'''''Mr. Show with Bob and David''''', also known as '''''Mr. Show''''', is an American [[sketch comedy]] [[television series|series]] starring and hosted by [[Bob Odenkirk]] and [[David Cross (actor)|David Cross]]. It aired on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] from November 3, 1995, to December 28, 1998.

Cross and Odenkirk introduced most episodes as versions of themselves, before transitioning to a mixture of live sketches and pre-taped segments. The show featured a number of [[alternative comedy|alternative comedian]]s as both cast members and writers, including [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[Jack Black]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Jerry Minor]], [[Scott Aukerman]], and [[Dino Stamatopoulos]].

It was nominated for four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], as well as a [[Golden Satellite Award]].

==Format==
Each episode of ''Mr. Show'' consists of a series of sketches, each one transitioning to the next by a link in a manner reminiscent of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.<ref name="your">{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/13/your-next-boxset-mr-show | title=Your next box set: Mr Show with Bob and David | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 13, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | author=O'Neill, Phelim}}</ref><ref name="amazon">{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Show-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B0002ERXBS | title=Mr. Show - The Complete Fourth Season (2004) - Editorial Reviews | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | author=Keogh, Tom}}</ref><ref name="interview">{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/2013/09/22/223352330/hollywood-said-no-but-mr-show-fans-said-yes | title='Hollywood Said No,' But 'Mr. Show' Fans Said Yes! | work=[[NPR]] | date=September 22, 2013 | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | author=[[All Things Considered]]}}</ref> For example, a minor character in one sketch might return as the major character in the next.  Often, common themes or story lines are returned to at different times throughout an episode.   It is regarded by sketch comedy aficionados as perhaps the best of its era,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Norris |first1=Chris |year=2001 |title=Baldy McJew Goes to Hollywood |journal=Spin |issue=June 2001}}</ref> though as a premium cable show its audience was necessarily limited. DVD editions, however, have sold briskly, opening the show to a broad new audience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sacks, Mike.|year=2009|title=And Here's the Kicker: Conversations with 21 Top Humor Writers on Their Craft|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1582975051}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spitz |first1=Mark |year=2011 |title=The Oral History of Mr. Show |journal=Spin |issue=April 2011}}</ref>

Every episode begins with an individual introducing the hosts. This role was filled by [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] in the first two seasons.  After her departure for personal reasons,<ref>{{cite book|last=Odenkirk | first=Naomi |page=52 |year=2002 |title=Mr. Show: What Happened?! The Complete Story and Episode Guide |publisher= Squaresville Books |isbn=0971359784}}</ref> the introduction was made by a random character from that week's episode.

Episode titles were mostly quotes from the episode. For example, "[[Bush Is a Pussy]]" is a writing on a T-shirt worn by one of the characters. One of the exceptions is "[[Eat Rotten Fruit from a Shitty Tree]]", which is a line in a song within the episode that was eventually performed as an instrumental.

Certain lines of dialogue are often repeated by different characters during the course of a single show (e.g., "I was on the eighteenth hole!" in "[[The Biggest Failure in Broadway History]]" and "[[Who Let You In?|Who let you in?]]" in the episode of the same name).

At the end of each episode's credits, a random celebrity is listed in the "Special Thanks" section. Examples include: [[Rick Dees]] (in the first episode) and [[Greg Maddux]] (in the third episode).

==Themes==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
The show contains a strong, confident contrarian viewpoint, little respect for [[tradition]]alism and at times satirizes [[organized religion]] and global [[capitalism]].  ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' noted that the series had mocked "[[satanism]], [[Youth suicide|teenage suicide]], [[cock ring]]s, [[hermaphrodite]]s, [[after-school special]]s about [[mentally challenged]] parents, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]."<ref name="vf">''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article: "[http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/04/david-cross-and.html Mr. Pilot!: An Interview with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross]."</ref>

Many of the show's sketches were constructed with a strong critique of modern television in mind, whether it be local news, sitcoms, commercials, infomercials, reality shows, or music videos.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Legacy==
While the show was never viewed by a mass audience due to its premium cable broadcast, it remains a highly influential piece of American sketch comedy{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Many involved with the show have gone on to become staples of the American comedy landscape.

''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' was written by and stars [[Sarah Silverman]], and features [[Jay Johnston]] and [[Brian Posehn]]. ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' features David Cross as regular character [[Tobias Fünke]]; the series also had guest spots filled by ''Mr. Show'' alumni, such as Bob Odenkirk as a marriage counselor, [[Jerry Minor]] and Jay Johnston as gay cops, and [[John Ennis (actor)|John Ennis]] as a mall security guard. [[Jack Black]] had supporting roles in ''Mr. Show''.

Tompkins]].

In January 2011, [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] began airing 90-minute blocks of ''Mr. Show'', ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'' and ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' three times per week.<ref name="onion" /> The programming block was often hosted by ''Mr. Show'' writer and actor Scott Aukerman, who also conducted new interviews with the shows' contributors and younger comedians who have been influenced by the shows.<ref name="onion" />

===''David's Situation''===
Odenkirk and Cross reunited in 2008 to create the HBO pilot ''David's Situation'', which was shot but never aired or picked up.<ref name="vf" /><ref name="avcross">''[[The Onion AV Club]]'' article: "[http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-cross,45855/ David Cross]."</ref> The network gave the pair $400,000 to shoot a pilot (which was shot on the ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' [[soundstage]]), which appeared to go well during the taping; however, while Cross and Odenkirk were editing the episode, they felt it failed to "capture that same energy on screen."<ref name="vfcross">''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article: "[http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2010/10/david-cross-says-he-is-not-angry-or-bitter.html David Cross Pleads Mercy for Insulting Your Best Friend Jesus]."</ref> In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Cross said, "We told them that we didn't want to do this show, we'd rather do ''Mr. Show  2.0''. And they were like, 'Yeah, O.K., that's great, but the thing is, we don't have any more money for this year. But we'll figure out something next year.' And we never heard from them again."<ref name="vfcross" />

===Comedians and shows inspired by ''Mr. Show''===
