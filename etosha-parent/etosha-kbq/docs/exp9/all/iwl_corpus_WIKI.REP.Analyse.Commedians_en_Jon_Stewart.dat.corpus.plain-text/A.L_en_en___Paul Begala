He earned both his [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he taught briefly. While at the University of Texas, Begala was a candidate for student government president. However, he finished second to a [[Write-in candidate|write-in campaign]] for Hank the Hallucination, a character from the campus comic strip ''[[Eyebeam (comic)|Eyebeam]]''. Following his loss, Begala wrote a [[tongue-in-cheek]] complaint for the ''[[Daily Texan]]'', arguing "I cannot help but feel Hank's platform is illusory at best...I must say that the candidate himself lacks substance". Begala was declared the human winner, following a ruling that imaginary characters could not hold the position.<ref>[http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/paper410/news/2004/04/19/TopStories/Sg.Helps.Foster.Future.Leaders-664368.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com SG helps foster future leaders], ''The Daily Texan'', 19 April 2004; accessed 2008-02-05.</ref>
