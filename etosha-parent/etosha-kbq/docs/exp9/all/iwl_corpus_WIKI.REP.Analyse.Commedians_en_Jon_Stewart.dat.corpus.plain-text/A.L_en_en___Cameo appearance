A '''cameo role''' or '''cameo appearance''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|i|oʊ}}; often shortened to just '''cameo''') is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the [[performing arts]], typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by [[celebrity|celebrities]], [[film director]]s, [[politician]]s, [[sportsperson|athlete]]s or [[musician]]s are common. A crew member of the show or movie playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|frequently performed cameos]].

==History, uses and examples==
Originally "cameo role" meant "a small character part that stands out from the other minor parts".  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] connects this with the meaning "a short literary sketch or portrait", which is based on the literal meaning of "[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]".<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, "cameo".</ref> More recently, "cameo" has come to refer to any short appearances, whether as a character or as oneself, such as the examples below.

Cameos are generally not credited because of their brevity, or a perceived mismatch between the celebrity's stature and the film or [[TV show]] in which he or she is appearing. Many are [[publicity stunt]]s. Others are acknowledgments of an actor's contribution to an earlier work, as in the case of many [[film adaptation]]s of TV series, or of [[remake]]s of earlier films. Others honour artists or celebrities known for work in a particular field.

A cameo can establish a character as being important without having much screen time. Examples of such cameos are [[Peter Capaldi]] in the 50th Anniversary episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', [[Ted Danson]] in ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', [[Hugh Jackman]] in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', [[Anthony Hopkins]] in ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]'', [[George Clooney]] in ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'', [[Sigourney Weaver]] in ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'', and [[Michael Bay]] in ''[[Bad Boys II]]''. [[Jason Robards]]' uncredited appearance at the opening of ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' was brief but a key element of the plot.

Possibly the best-known series of cameos was by the director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who made very brief appearances in most of his films.

Cameos also occur in [[novel]]s and other literary works. “Literary cameos” usually involve an established character from another work who makes a brief appearance to establish a [[shared universe]] setting, to make a point, or to offer [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. [[Balzac]] often employed this practice, as in his ''[[La Comédie humaine|Comédie humaine]]''. Sometimes a cameo features a historical person who "drops in" on fictional characters in a [[historical novel]], as when [[Benjamin Franklin]] shares a [[beer]] with Phillipe Charboneau in ''[[The Bastard (novel)|The Bastard]]'' by [[John Jakes]].

A cameo appearance can be made by the author of a work to put a sort of personal "signature" on a story. [[Clive Cussler]] made appearances in his own thriller novels as a "rough old man" who advised action hero [[Dirk Pitt]].  [[Vladimir Nabokov]] often put himself in his novels; for instance, the very minor character Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of the author's name) in ''[[Lolita]]''. An example in [[comic book|comics]] is [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' #8, which features appearances by Byrne himself, [[Howard the Duck]] (on a poster), [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[McCloud (TV series)|Sam McCloud]], [[Fu Manchu]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

===Film directors===
[[Quentin Tarantino]] provides cameos or small roles in some of his movies.

Likewise, [[Peter Jackson]] has made brief cameos in all of his movies, except for his first feature-length movie ''[[Bad Taste]]'' in which he plays a main character, as well as ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]''. For example, he plays a peasant eating a carrot in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]''; a Rohan warrior in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and a pirate boatswain in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''. All four were non-speaking "blink and you miss him" appearances, although in the Extended Release of ''The Return of the King'', his character was given more screen time and his reprise of the carrot eating peasant in The Desolation of Smaug was featured in the foreground in reference to The Fellowship of the Ring - last seen twelve years earlier. He also appears in his 2005 [[remake]] of ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' as the gunner on a biplane in the finale, in a reference to [[King Kong(1933 film)|the original film]] where [[Merian Cooper]], the film's director, plays the same role. He also makes a cameo in ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' as a man dressed as [[Santa Claus]] who stabs [[Simon Pegg]]'s character.

Director [[Martin Scorsese]] appears in the background of his films as a bystander or an [[unseen character]]. In ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'', he appears as one of the gangsters, a passenger in ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. He opens up his 1986 film ''[[The Color of Money]]'' with a monologue on the art of playing pool. In addition, he appears with his wife and daughter as wealthy New Yorkers in ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', and he appears as a theatre-goer and is heard as a movie projectionist in ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]''.

In a same way, [[Roman Polanski]] appears as a hired hoodlum in his film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', slitting Jack Nicholson's nose with the blade of his clasp knife, as [[Denys Arcand]] portrays a judge in his film ''[[Jesus of Montreal]]''. (Note that, as an actor, he also portrays regular characters in several Canadian movies.)

===Actors and writers===
In the film version of [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Raoul Duke, Hunter S. Thompson's alter-ego, Thompson can be seen quickly as an older version of Depp's character in a flashback scene at a San Francisco nightclub. Similarly, [[Arthur C. Clarke]] makes a brief cameo appearance in the [[2010 (film)|film adaptation]] of his book ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. [[S. E. Hinton]] played a nurse in the film adaptation of her novel, ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]''. [[Stephenie Meyer]] appears eating at a diner in the film adaptation of her novel, ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]''.
In the 2007 film ''[[Choke (film)|Choke]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]], the writer of the novel on which the film was based, briefly appears in the final scene of the film.

In the 2009 film ''[[The Invention of Lying]]'', there were cameos from Edward Norton as a cop, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a bartender, Christopher Guest, Stephen Merchant and Shaun Williamson (Barry from Eastenders). In the recent film adaptation of author Sapphire's 1996 novel ''[[Push (novel)|Push]]'', (renamed ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' so as not to be confused with the [[Push (2009 film)|2009 action film of the same name]]), Sapphire appears in one of the end scenes as the woman running the daycare.

Remakes and sequels occasionally feature actors from the original films. The 1978 remake of ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' featured a cameo by [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], who starred in the [[Invasion of the Body Snatchers|1956 original]]. In the 2003 version of ''[[Willard (2003 film)|Willard]]'', the framed picture of Willard's father is a picture of [[Bruce Davison]], who played Willard in the [[Willard (1971 film)|1971 version]] of the film. The 2004 version of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' features cameos by [[Ken Foree]], and [[Scott Reiniger]]. The original stars of ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'' appeared at the end of the 2004 film, and [[Bernie Kopell]], who portrayed Siegfried in the [[Get Smart|original show]] appeared in the 2008 film version of ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]''. [[Vin Diesel]] made a short appearance at the end of ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' where he challenges to race Shawn ([[Lucas Black]]), the then [[Drift king]].

In the same vein as the remake and sequel, actors can also make appearances in completely different films directed by or starring another actor they are friendly with. Actors [[Ben Stiller]], [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Luke Wilson]], and [[Will Ferrell]] have made appearances in so many of the same films (whether as lead characters or cameos) ''[[USA Today]]'' coined the term  the "[[Frat Pack]]" to name the group.<ref>{{cite news |author=Wloszczyna, Susan |title=Wilson and Vaughn: Leaders of the 'Frat Pack' |work=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-15-frat-pack_x.htm |date=2004-06-15}}</ref> Actor [[Adam Sandler]] is also known for frequently casting fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performers (including [[Rob Schneider]] and [[David Spade]]) in various roles in his films (as well as making cameo appearances of his own in theirs, most of which he co-produces). [[Sam Raimi]] frequently uses his brother [[Ted Raimi|Ted]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] in his films.<ref>[http://www.monsters-movies.com/sam_raimi.htm Monsters-Movies.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/workedwith IMDb.com]</ref> [[Sylvester Stallone]] gave [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] a cameo in Stallone's 2010 action film ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]''.

Directors can also be known to cast well-known lead actors with whom they have worked in the past in other films. Among the many cameos featured in the film ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'', (directed by [[Richard Donner]]), actor [[Danny Glover]] ([[Mel Gibson]]'s co-star in the ''[[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon]]'' [[Media franchise|franchise]] of films also directed by Donner) appears as the lead [[bank robber]]. He and Maverick (Gibson) share a scene where they look as if they knew each other, but then shake it off. As Glover makes his escape with the [[money]], he mutters "I'm too old for this shit", his character's [[catchphrase]] in the ''Lethal Weapon'' film series. In addition, a strain of the main [[Theme (music)|theme]] from ''Lethal Weapon'' plays in the [[Film score|score]] when Glover is revealed. Actress [[Margot Kidder]] made a cameo appearance in the same film as a [[Robbery|robbed]] villager, and the actress previously starred as [[Lois Lane]] in one of Donner's earlier films ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''.

In the 2003 film ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'', Louis Sachar, the author of the original [[Holes (book)|novel]], makes a cameo appearance as Mr. Collingwood, the bald man whom Sam ([[Dule Hill]]) gives a supposed hair tonic made from onions. The last dialog of the 1993 film ''[[The Music of Chance]]'' is between the escaping hero and a providential rescuer portrayed by [[Paul Auster]], notorious author of the original [[The Music of Chance|novel]]. James Dickey plays the Sherriff at the end of the 1972 film of his novel "Deliverance."

The 1992 and 1993 comedies ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' and ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' devise fun from many referential devices, among which are cameos.

In the movie ''[[Run Ronnie Run]]'' with [[David Cross]], there are cameos from a variety of famous performers from the worlds of comedy, acting and even music: ([[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]], [[Scott Ian]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]] just to name a few).

''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]'', a drama about how the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' began, features many [[An Adventure in Space and Time#Cast|actors from the show's past]], including two past companions in a party scene, another as a mother calling her children in for dinner and a fourth in a car park at the BBC.

===Real-life people===
Films based on actual events occasionally include cameo roles of the people portrayed in them. In the 2006 film ''[[The Pursuit of Happyness]]'' [[Chris Gardner]] makes a cameo in the end. ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', a film about [[Tony Wilson]], has a cameo by the real Tony Wilson and many other notable people. In the film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] (the real commander of that flight) and his wife Marilyn appear next to the actors playing them ([[Tom Hanks]] and [[Kathleen Quinlan]] respectively). [[Domino Harvey]] makes a short appearance in the credits of ''[[Domino (film)|Domino]]''. The real [[Erin Brockovich]] has a cameo appearance as a waitress named Julia in the [[Erin Brockovich (film)|eponymous movie]] (where her role is played by actress [[Julia Roberts]]). The 2000 film '' [[Almost Famous]]'' featured ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' co-founder [[Jann Wenner]] as a passenger in a New York City taxicab. [[Chuck Yeager]] has a cameo as "Fred", a bartender at "Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club", in ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''. Likewise, several associates of [[Harvey Milk]] appear in the 2008 film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]''. In the 2008 film ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'' Jeff Ma, the character the film is based on, plays a blackjack dealer at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. His character in the movie calls him "my brother from another mother".

In a similar vein, cameos sometimes feature persons noted for accomplishments outside the film industry, usually in ways related to the subject or setting of the film. In the 2011 film ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', [[Buzz Aldrin]] appeared as himself whereby he reveals certain details as to what really happened (although fictional) during the [[Apollo 11]] space mission. ''[[October Sky]]'' (1999), set in 1950s [[Appalachia]], featured photographer [[O. Winston Link]] in a brief appearance portraying a steam locomotive engineer. Link became famous in the 1950s for chronicling the last days of regular steam locomotives service in the region. ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' (2000), set in Depression-era rural South, featured cameos by country "roots" music notables such as [[Alison Krauss]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Gillian Welch]], [[The Whites]] and the [[Fairfield Four]]. In the film ''[[The Last Mimzy]]'', noted string theorist [[Brian Greene]] has a cameo as the Intel scientist. In ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' a cameo appearance was made by [[Steve Irwin]]. [[Stan Lee]], the creator of many [[Marvel Comics]] characters has appeared in the film versions of the comics, including ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''. Skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]] makes a cameo as a dead body in an episode of ''[[CSI: Miami]]''. In ''[[Men in Black II]]'', [[Biz Markie]] (a hip hop artist) appears as an alien who uses [[beatboxing]] to communicate, also [[Michael Jackson]] appeared as Agent M.

[[Mike Todd]]'s film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956) was filled with cameo roles: ([[John Gielgud]] as an English butler, [[Frank Sinatra]] playing piano in a saloon), and others. The stars in cameo roles were pictured in oval insets in posters for the film, and gave the term wide circulation outside the theatrical profession. Notably the [[Around the World in 80 Days (TV miniseries)|1983 television adaptation]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|2004 film version]] of the story also feature a large number of cameos.

''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), an "epic comedy", also features cameos from nearly every popular American comedian alive at the time, including [[the Three Stooges]], a silent appearance by [[Buster Keaton]] and a voice-only cameo by [[Selma Diamond]]. [[Bill Murray]] made a cameo as himself in the 2009 movie ''[[Zombieland]]'' with featured [[Ghostbusters]] antics.

In the ongoing TV-series ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', figures notorious especially to the main characters' type regularly appear as themselves. Though their screen time is kept to a minimum, they do have dialog, and a whole episode's plot then tends to revolve around them. Aside from science-fiction actors such as [[Summer Glau]], [[Katee Sackhoff]], and some of the cast from ''[[Star Trek The Next Generation]]'', renowned people such as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] also appear in the series. While some of these appearances remain cameos, others become recurring.

In 2010 when [[Charlie Sheen]] made media news history, he was known for the cameo performance in the independent film, ''[[She Wants Me]]'' starring [[Josh Gad]], [[Kristen Ruhlin]] and [[Hilary Duff]] which he also executive produced. This was weeks before his departure from the hit series ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.

In the 2011 film ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'' starring [[Adam Sandler]], actor [[Johnny Depp]], ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'' host [[Drew Carey]] and announcer [[George Gray (TV host)|George Gray]] made a cameo as themselves. Prior to Carey's assumption of hosting duties, previous host [[Bob Barker]] earned a certain degree of notoriety for his frequent cameos in other productions, most famously in the 1996 film ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (which featured Barker beating up a much younger Sandler).

In a more well known example, [[Elon Musk]] and [[Larry Ellison]], both founders of large technology companies, are featured in cameos in 2010 blockbuster, [[Iron Man 2]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/velocity/2010/04/29/elon-musk-larry-ellison-have-cameos-in-iron-man-2/ | work=Forbes | first=Andy | last=Greenberg | title=Elon Musk, Larry Ellison Appear In Iron Man 2}}</ref>

<!-- NOTE: Please do not add lots of individual examples here, unless they illustrate something new -->
Also some members of royalty have made cameos: [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], king of Sweden, was in children's program "Mika" ''(Mika och renen Ossian på äventyr)'' when Mika was in [[Stockholm]] with his reindeer.<ref>[http://itssolastcentury.co.uk/truck/Mika Its so last century: Mika]</ref> Another royal is the present king of Jordan [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II]], who appeared briefly in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' ("[[Investigations (Star Trek: Voyager)|Investigations]]") while still a prince.

The makers of the animated series [[Adventures of Tintin]] featured [[Hergé]] in all of the episodes.
