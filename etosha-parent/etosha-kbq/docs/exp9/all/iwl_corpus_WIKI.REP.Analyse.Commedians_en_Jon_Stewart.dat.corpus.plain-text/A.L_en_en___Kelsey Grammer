== Career ==

=== Stage ===
After leaving [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]], he had a three-year internship with the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[San Diego]] in the late 1970s before a stint in 1980 at the [[Guthrie Theater]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He made his Broadway debut in 1981 as "Lennox" in ''[[Macbeth]]'', taking [[Macbeth (character)|the lead role]] when [[Philip Anglim]] withdrew after receiving negative reviews. Grammer then played [[Michael Cassio]] in a Broadway revival of ''[[Othello]]'', with [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Christopher Plummer]]. In 1983 he performed on the demo of the [[Stephen Sondheim]]–[[James Lapine]] production ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', starring [[Mandy Patinkin]]. In 2000, Grammer again played ''Macbeth'' on Broadway, in a production that closed after only 10 days.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/20/theater/macbeth-will-close-after-just-10-days-on-broadway.html 'Macbeth' Will Close After Just 10 Days on Broadway] NYTimes.com retrieved October 5, 2014</ref>

On April 18, 2010, Grammer made his [[Broadway musical]] debut playing the role of Georges in a revival of the [[Jerry Herman]]/[[Harvey Fierstein]] musical ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', for which he was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]].

=== Television ===
His television career began in the early 1980s when he portrayed [[Stephen Edward Smith|Stephen Smith]] in the [[NBC]] miniseries ''[[Kennedy (miniseries)|Kennedy]]''.

====''Cheers'' and ''Frasier''====
Grammer came to broader public attention as [[Frasier Crane|Dr. Frasier Crane]] in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''. Grammer's former Juilliard classmate and Broadway co-star Patinkin suggested Grammer to the New York [[casting (performing arts)|casting director]], and he got what was supposed to be a six-episode job, but ended up as a regular cast member.<ref name="yahoo">[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800020246/bio Yahoo Movies: Kelsey Grammer]. Movies.yahoo.com. Retrieved May 2, 2012.</ref>

The character became the center of the spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', one of the most successful spin-offs in TV history. In addition to starring, he also directed more than 30 episodes, especially during the second half of the series, and sang the closing theme "Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs." ''Frasier'' won and was nominated for many [[Fraiser#Awards|awards]] during its 11-year run.

In 2001 he negotiated a US$700,000-per-episode salary for ''Frasier''. His 20-year run playing Dr. Frasier Crane ties a length set by [[James Arness]] in playing [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' from 1955 to 1975<ref>[http://online.tvguide.com/newsearch/detail.aspx?id=160338&sourcetype=C&tvobjectid=160338 TV Guide: Kelsey Grammer].

=== Sex tape lawsuit ===
In 1998, Grammer filed a lawsuit against Internet Entertainment Group (IEG), which Grammer claimed had stolen from his home a [[celebrity sex tape|videotape of him having sex with a woman]]. IEG countersued Grammer, denying it was in possession of such a tape, and Grammer's suit was eventually dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,614966,00.html|title=Report: Kelsey's 'X'-Files}}</ref> IEG President [[Seth Warshavsky]] later said, "We have been presented with another Kelsey Grammer tape. But we have no plans to air it. We are still evaluating it at this time."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eonline.com/news/37400/kelsey-grammer-sex-tape-suit-unsealed|title=Kelsey Grammer Sex Tape Suit Unsealed|publisher=[[E!]] | first= Daniel |last=Frankel |date=December 3, 1998| archivedate= April 24, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040942/http://www.eonline.com/news/37400/kelsey-grammer-sex-tape-suit-unsealed  | deadurl=no}}</ref> Grammer later reflected, "Whether or not you're a celebrity—even if you're just an old slob with a video camera—you don't realize you shouldn't do it. So you throw the tape in the back of a dark closet until your old girlfriend remembers it's there because you're famous now and she's not. But if you're not prepared to do the time, don't do the crime."<ref name="maximonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7159 |title=The Beast Unleashed!  |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=December 19, 2009| archivedate= December 24, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224050430/http://www.maxim.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7159}}</ref>

=== Substance abuse and legal issues ===
Grammer allegedly began drinking alcohol at the age of nine; although he denies this in his autobiography, he did become a frequent [[alcoholism|abuser of alcohol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110754,00.html|title=Cheers and Tears|author=Michael A.

Grammer's personal problems affected his work; costar [[Bebe Neuwirth]] and writer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] cited delays with rehearsals and filming due to his erratic behavior.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Writer [[Dan O'Shannon]] recalled, however, that<ref name="gqraftery201210">{{cite news | url=http://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201210/cheers-oral-history-extended?printable=true | title=The Best TV Show That's Ever Been | work=GQ | date=October 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2012 | author=Raftery, Brian}}</ref>

It was the most amazing transformation I'd ever seen.{{r|gqraftery201210}}}}

In 1995, Grammer was sued by ex-girlfriend Cerlette Lamme for [[defamation]] of character and [[privacy law|invasion of privacy]] over content he included in his autobiography ''So Far''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmicbaseball.com/grammer9.html |title=COSMIC BASEBALL ASSOCIATION Kelsey Grammer 1999 Cosmic Player Plate |publisher=Cosmicbaseball.com |accessdate=December 19, 2009}}</ref> In September 1996, he crashed his [[Dodge Viper]] while intoxicated, and subsequently checked into the [[Betty Ford Center]] (an [[Drug rehabilitation|alcohol rehabilitation]] clinic) for 30 days.<ref name="Tribute.ca"/>

In August 2008, [[Freedom's Watch|Bradley Blakeman]], a former aide to [[George W. Bush]], filed a copyright lawsuit in federal court on [[Long Island]] over Grammer's movie ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]'', claiming that parts of its plot and marketing had been stolen from him. The lawsuit claimed that Blakeman had given a copyrighted screenplay called ''Go November'' to Grammer in 2006, and that Grammer agreed to develop the project and star as a Republican president but instead ended up playing a similar role in ''Swing Vote'', which was released on August 1, 2008. Grammer's spokesman dismissed the claims as "[[frivolous litigation|frivolous]]" and a "waste of time". The lawsuit claims that Blakeman's copyrighted screenplay had the same basic plot as ''Swing Vote''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-08-07-swing-vote-lawsuit_N.htm|title=Ex-Bush aide files lawsuit over 'Swing Vote' movie | work=USA Today | first=Samantha|last=Gross|date=August 8, 2008}}</ref>
