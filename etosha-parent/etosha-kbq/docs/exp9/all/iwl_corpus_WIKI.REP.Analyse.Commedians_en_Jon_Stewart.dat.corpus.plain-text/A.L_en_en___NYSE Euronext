===Attempted NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse merger===

In 2011, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' reported that the German exchange operator [[Deutsche Börse]] was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext for $9.53 billion in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deutsche Boerse AG’s $9.53 billion all-stock purchase of New York Stock Exchange parent NYSE Euronext creates the world’s largest owner of equities and derivatives markets, and may spur additional mergers.|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-15/deutsche-boerse-9-53-billion-nyse-buy-may-spur-deals}}</ref> The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|title=While the merged entity will list corporations with about $15 trillion in value, more than any other exchange, what may prove more lucrative is ownership of growing venues for trading futures and options, said Rich Repetto, a New York-based analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP.|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-15/deutsche-boerse-9-53-billion-nyse-buy-may-spur-deals}}</ref>

The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext.

On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized.<ref>{{cite news|title=Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) on Thursday secured shareholder backing for its planned merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX), focusing attention on efforts to win regulatory clearance for what would be the world's largest exchange operator.

The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a “[[de facto monopoly|''de facto'' monopoly]]”.
 
In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, [[Joaquin Almunia]], the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.<ref>Rummer, Andrew, and Peter Chapman, editors, [http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LSYAH56K50Y601-09845DBNU4QT522C0IPVDS93NA "NYSE Euronext May Seek EU Hearing to Defend Deutsche Boerse Deal"], ''Bloomberg'', October 13, 2011 11:06 am EDT.

On February 1, 2012, the European Union blocked the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission—the EU's executive body—ruled against the merger because, they said, the combined exchange would control more than 90% of the trade in European derivatives. The European Commission report stated, "The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide... These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive".<ref>[http://www.npr.org/2012/02/01/146215168/, EU blocks Deutsche Boerse NYSE Euronext merger], ''The Associated Press'', Feb 1, 2012.
