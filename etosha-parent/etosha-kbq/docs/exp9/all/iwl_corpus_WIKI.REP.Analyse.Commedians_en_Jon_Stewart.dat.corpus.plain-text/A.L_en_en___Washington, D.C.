'''Washington, D.C.''', formally the '''District of Columbia''' and commonly referred to as '''Washington''', "'''the District'''", or simply '''D.C.''', is the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[United States]]. The signing of the [[Residence Act]] on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a [[capital district]] located along the [[Potomac River]] on the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] provided for a [[federal district]] under the [[District of Columbia home rule|exclusive jurisdiction]] of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the District is therefore not a part of any [[U.S. state]].

The states of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] each donated land to form the federal district, which included the pre-existing settlements of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]. Named in honor of [[George Washington]], the City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned the land originally ceded by Virginia]]; in 1871, it created a [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|single municipal government]] for the remaining portion of the District.

Washington, D.C., had an estimated population of 658,893 in 2014, the [[List of United States cities by population|23rd-most populous city]] in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's population to more than one&nbsp;million during the workweek. The [[Washington metropolitan area]], of which the District is a part, has a population of 5.8&nbsp;million, the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|seventh-largest]] [[United States metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan statistical area]] in the country.

The centers of all three branches of the [[federal government of the United States]] are in the District, including the Congress, [[President of the United States|President]], and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Washington is home to many national [[List of museums in Washington, D.C.|monuments and museums]], which are primarily situated on or around the [[National Mall]]. The city hosts 176 [[List of diplomatic missions in the United States|foreign embassies]] as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations.

A locally elected [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|mayor]] and a 13‑member [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] have governed the District since 1973.  However, the Congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws. D.C. residents elect a [[District of Columbia voting rights|non-voting]], at-large [[Non-voting members of the United States House of representatives|congressional delegate]] to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], but the District has no representation in the [[U.S. Senate]]. The District receives [[Electoral College (United States)|three electoral votes]] in presidential elections as permitted by the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1961.

==History==
{{Main|History of Washington, D.C.}}

Various [[tribe]]s of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataway people]] (also known as the Conoy) inhabited the lands around the [[Potomac River]] when Europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century. One group known as the [[Nacotchtank]] (also called the Nacostines by [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionaries]]) maintained settlements around the [[Anacostia River]] within the present-day District of Columbia. Conflicts with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near [[Point of Rocks, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphrey|first=Robert L.|title=Ancient Washington: American Indian Cultures of the Potomac Valley|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~gwipp/Ancient%20Washington.pdf|publisher=The George Washington University|accessdate=February 14, 2014|author2=Mary Elizabeth Chambers |year=1977}}</ref>

In his [[Federalist No. 43]], published January 23, 1788, [[James Madison]] argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/fedpapers/fed_43.html |title=The Federalist No. 43 |accessdate=September 5, 2011 |last=Madison |first=James |work=The Independent Journal |publisher=Library of Congress }}</ref> Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article One, Section Eight]], of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] therefore permits the establishment of a "District (not exceeding ten&nbsp;miles&nbsp;square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html |title=Constitution of the United States |accessdate=July 22, 2008 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}</ref> However, the Constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In what is now known as the [[Compromise of 1790]], Madison, [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]] came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the [[Southern United States]].<ref name=Crew124>{{cite book|last=Crew|first=Harvey W.|author2=William Bensing Webb |author3=John Wooldridge  |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]], which approved the creation of a national capital on the [[Potomac River]]. The exact location was to be selected by President [[George Washington]], who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring {{convert|10|mi|km|}} on each side, totaling {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|}}.<ref name=Crew89>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb |author3=John Wooldridge  |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Maryland]], founded in 1751,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/dc15.htm |title=Georgetown Historic District |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}</ref> and the city of [[Alexandria, Virginia]], founded in 1749.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandriahistorical.org/history.html |title=Alexandria's History |accessdate=April 4, 2009 |publisher=Alexandria Historical Society }}</ref> During 1791–92, [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Andrew Ellicott]] and several assistants, including a [[Free negro|free African American]] astronomer named [[Benjamin Banneker]], surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed [[Boundary Stones (District of Columbia)|boundary stones]] at every mile point.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordewich|first=Fergus M.|title=Washington: the making of the American capital|year=2008|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-084238-3|pages=76–80|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kKKMJ7Rqta8C}}</ref> Many of the stones are still standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/ |title=Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C. |publisher=BoundaryStones.org |accessdate=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>

A new [[federal city]] was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb |author3=John Wooldridge |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ|title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C.|chapter=IV.

Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801|Organic Act of 1801]], which officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the [[District of Columbia home rule|exclusive control]] of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the [[Washington County, D.C.|County of Washington]] to the east of the Potomac and the [[Alexandria County, D.C.|County of Alexandria]] to the west.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb |author3=John Wooldridge  |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

===Retrocession and the Civil War===
{{see also|District of Columbia retrocession|Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War}}
In the 1830s, the District's southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.<ref name=richards>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Mark David|date=Spring–Summer 2004|title=The Debates over the Retrocession of the District of Columbia, 1801–2004|journal=Washington History|publisher=Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|pages=54–82|url=http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}</ref> The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American [[slave trade]], and pro-slavery residents feared that [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] in Congress would end [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the District, through a process known as [[District of Columbia retrocession|retrocession]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Greeley |first=Horace |title=The American Conflict: A History of the Great Rebellion in the United States |publisher=G. & C.W. Sherwood |year=1864 |location=Chicago |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZlIMAAAAYAAJ |pages=142–144}}</ref>

The [[Virginia General Assembly]] voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by Virginia. Therefore, the District's current area consists only of the land originally donated by Maryland.<ref name=richards /> Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Compromise1850.html |title=Compromise of 1850 |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |date=September 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref>

[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|thumb|The [[L'Enfant Plan]] for Washington, D.C., as revised by [[Andrew Ellicott]] in 1792]]

Washington, D.C., is a [[New town|planned city]]. In 1791, President Washington commissioned [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]], a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital. The [[L'Enfant Plan]] featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.<ref name=lenfant>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm |title=The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] }}</ref> He based his design on plans of cities such as [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Karlsruhe]], and [[Milan]] brought from Europe by Thomas Jefferson in 1788.<ref>{{cite book|title=Public space and the ideology of place in American culture|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2574-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7pVtaBw6cq0C|editor=Miles Orvell|page=22}}</ref> L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined "grand avenue" approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} in length and {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide in the area that is now the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm|title=Map 1: The L'Enfant Plan for Washington|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref>

President Washington dismissed L'Enfant in March 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who had worked with L'Enfant surveying the city, was then tasked with completing the design. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans, including changes to some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crew |first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb |author3=John Wooldridge  |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.

By the early 1900s, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.<ref name=ramroth /> What became known as the [[McMillan Plan]] was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new city-wide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.<ref name=lenfant />

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution]] grants the U.S. Congress "exclusive jurisdiction" over the city. The District did not have an elected local government until the passage of the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|1973 Home Rule Act]]. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|elected mayor]], currently [[Muriel Bowser]], and the thirteen-member [[Council of the District of Columbia]].

===Budgetary issues===
The mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which must be approved by the Congress. The [[Government Accountability Office]] and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470&nbsp;million and over $1&nbsp;billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as [[Medicaid]] and the operation of the [[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997|local justice system]]; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.<ref name=DCAppleseed>{{cite web|title=Buildling the Best Capital City in the World|url=http://www.dcappleseed.org/library/DC%20Appleseed%20Report.FINAL.pdf|publisher=DC Appleseed|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=GAO>{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Structural Imbalance and Management Issues|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03666.pdf|publisher=Government Accountability Office|date=May 2003|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref>
