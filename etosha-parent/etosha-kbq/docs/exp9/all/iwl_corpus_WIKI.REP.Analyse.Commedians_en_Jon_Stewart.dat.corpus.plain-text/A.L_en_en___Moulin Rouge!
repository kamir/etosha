'''''Moulin Rouge!''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|uː|l|æ|n|_|ˈ|ɹ|uː|ʒ}}, from {{IPA-fr|mulɛ̃ ˈʁuʒ|lang}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Wells, John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|publisher=3rd ed. [[Longman]]|isbn=1-4058-8118-6 |authorlink=John C. Wells}}</ref>) is a 2001 Australian–American [[pastiche]]-[[jukebox musical]] film directed, produced, and co-written by [[Baz Luhrmann]]. It tells the story of a young English poet/writer, Christian ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who falls in love with the terminally-ill star of the [[Moulin Rouge]], [[cabaret]] actress and [[courtesan]] Satine ([[Nicole Kidman]]). It uses the musical setting of the [[Montmartre|Montmartre Quarter]] of Paris, France.

At the [[74th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for eight [[Academy Award|Oscars]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Nicole Kidman, winning two: for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. It was the first musical nominated for Best Picture in 10 years, following Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).

==Plot==
In the year 1900, a depressed [[United Kingdom|British]] writer named Christian ([[Ewan McGregor]]) begins writing on his typewriter ("''[[Nature Boy]]''"). One year earlier, Christian moved to the [[Montmartre]] district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] movement. He encounters performers led by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] ([[John Leguizamo]]); his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, "Spectacular Spectacular", that they wish to sell to Harold Zidler ([[Jim Broadbent]]), owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]]. The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his "Diamond Dog Dancers" perform for the audience ("''[[Lady Marmalade]]/Zidler's Rap (Can Can)/[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]''"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine ([[Nicole Kidman]]), the star [[courtesan]], in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth ([[Richard Roxburgh]]), a potential investor in the cabaret ("''Sparkling Diamonds''" medley).

Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately ("''[[Rhythm of the Night (song)|Rhythm of the Night]]''"), but soon learns he is just a writer; by this time Satine has fallen in love with him ("''[[Your Song]]''"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for "Spectacular Spectacular". With Zidler's help, Toulouse and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil [[maharajah]] attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who loves a poor [[sitar]] player ("''The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)''"). The Duke backs the show on the condition that only he may see Satine. Satine contemplates on Christian and her longing to leave the Moulin Rouge to become "a real actress" ("''[[One Day I'll Fly Away]]''"). Christian goes back to Satine to convince her that she loves him ("''Elephant Love Medley''"). As the cabaret is converted to a theater, Christian and Satine continue seeing each other under the pretense of rehearsing Satine's lines. The Duke becomes suspicious of their frequent  meetings and warns Zidler that he may stop financing the show; Zidler arranges for Satine to dine with the Duke that evening, but she falls ill from [[tuberculosis]] ("''[[Górecki (song)|Górecki]]''"). Zidler makes excuses to the Duke, claiming that Satine has gone to [[Confession (religion)|confession]] ("''[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]''"). Zidler learns that Satine does not have long to live. Satine tells Christian that their relationship endangers the show, but he counters by writing a secret love song to affirm their love ("''[[Come What May (2001 song)|Come What May]]''").

As the Duke watches Christian rehearsing with Satine, Nini, a jealous performer, points out that the play is a [[metaphor]] for Christian, Satine and the Duke. Enraged, the Duke demands the ending be changed with the courtesan choosing the maharajah; Satine offers to spend the night with the Duke to keep the original ending. At the Duke's quarters, Satine sees Christian on the streets below, and realizes she cannot sleep with the Duke. ("''El Tango de Roxanne: "[[Roxanne (song)|Roxanne]]/[[Mariano Mores|Tanguera]]''"). The Duke tries to rape her, but she is saved by Le Chocolat, one of the cabaret dancers, and reunited with Christian, who urges her to run away with him. The Duke tells Zidler he will have Christian killed if Satine is not his. Zidler reiterates this warning to Satine, but when she refuses to return, he finally informs her she is dying ("''A Fool to Believe''"). Zidler tells Satine to tell Christian that she will be staying with the Duke and she doesn't love him to push him away to save his life ("''[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]''"). Christian tries following her, but is denied entry to the Moulin Rouge, and becomes depressed, even though Toulouse insists that Satine does love him.

The night of the show, Christian sneaks into the Moulin Rouge, intending to pay Satine to return his love just as the Duke paid for her ("''Hindi Sad Diamonds''"). He catches Satine before she steps on stage and demands she tell him she does not love him. Suddenly they find themselves in the spotlight; Zidler convinces the audience that Christian is the sitar player in disguise. Christian denounces Satine and walks off the stage. From the rafters, Toulouse cries out, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return", spurring Satine to sing the song Christian wrote to express their love. Christian returns to the stage, joining her in the song. The Duke orders his bodyguard to kill Christian, but is thwarted, while the Duke's own attempt is stopped by Zidler. The Duke storms out of the cabaret as Christian and Satine complete their song ("''Come What May (Reprise)''", "''Coup d'État (Finale)''").

After the curtain closes, Satine succumbs to tuberculosis. Before she dies, Christian and Satine affirm their love and she tells him to write their story. A year later the Moulin Rouge has closed down, and Christian is writing the tale of his love for Satine, a "love that will live forever" ("''Nature Boy (Reprise)''").

==Production==
===Writing===
The storyline of ''Moulin Rouge'' can be traced back to [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'']]' ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'', although Luhrmann, as an opera director, was probably more directly influenced by [[Verdi]]'s adaptation, ''[[La traviata]]''.

When asked about his inspiration for ''Moulin Rouge!'', Luhrmann remarked:
{{cquote| When I was in [[India]] researching ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', we went to this huge, ice cream picture palace to see a [[Bollywood]] movie. Here we were, with 2,000 Indians watching a film in [[Hindi]], and there was the lowest possible comedy and then incredible drama and tragedy and then break out in songs. And it was three-and-a-half hours! We thought we had suddenly learnt Hindi, because we understood everything! We thought it was incredible. How involved the audience were. How uncool they were - how their coolness had been ripped aside and how they were united in this singular sharing of the story. The thrill of thinking, 'Could we ever do that in the West? Could we ever get past that cerebral cool and perceived cool.' It required this idea of comic-tragedy. Could you make those switches? Fine in [[Shakespeare]] - low comedy and then you die in five minutes. . . . In 'Moulin Rouge', we went further. Our recognisable story, though [[Orphean (mythology)|Orphean]] in shape, is derived from [[Camille (ballet)|Camille]], [[La Boheme]] - whether you know those texts or not, you recognise those patterns and character types.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/07/1 | work=[[theguardian.com]] Film | last=Andrew | first=Geoff | accessdate=2014-02-15 |title=Baz Luhrmann (I)}}</ref>}}

Luhrmann revealed that he drew from the [[Greek tragedy]] of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]] in the DVD's [[audio commentary]]. The legend of Orpheus says he was a musical [[genius]], far surpassing anyone in his world; the filmmakers chose to replicate this by using songs from the mid-to-late 20th century, many decades after the film's 1899 setting. In this way, Christian would appear to the other characters to be ahead-of-his-time as a musician and writer.

===Development===
[[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who worked with Luhrmann on ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', auditioned for the role of Christian.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tim Gray|title=Leonardo DiCaprio Unleashes a Fearless ‘Wolf’ Performance|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/leonardo-dicaprio-tackles-roles-that-push-the-envelope-1201096254|work=Variety|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> Luhrmann also considered younger actors for the role, including [[Heath Ledger]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] before Ewan McGregor won the part. [[Courtney Love]] auditioned for Satine and assisted in clearing licensing rights for "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" to be used in the film.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kara Warner|title=‘Moulin Rouge’ Could Have Starred Heath Ledger, Baz Luhrmann Reveals|publisher=MTV.com|date=May 2, 2011 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1663127/moulin-rouge-baz-luhrmann-heath-ledger/|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}</ref>

===Filming===
Production began in November 1999 and was completed in May 2000, with a budget of $52.5 million.<ref name="boab" /> Filming generally went smoothly, with the only major problem occurring when [[Nicole Kidman|Kidman]] injured her ribs while filming one of the more complicated dance sequences; she also stated in an interview with Graham Norton that she broke her rib while getting into a corset, by tightening it as much as possible to achieve an 18-inch waist.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/nicole-kidman-i-broke-my-rib-getting-into-corset-for-moulin-rouge/story-e6frfmvr-1227137677094|title = Nicole Kidman: ‘I broke my rib getting into corset for Moulin Rouge’|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The production also overran in its shooting schedule and had to be out of the [[Fox Studios]] in Sydney to make way for ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (in which [[Ewan McGregor|McGregor]] also starred). This necessitated some [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up shot]]s being filmed in [[Madrid]].

In the [[liner notes]] to the film's Special Edition DVD, Luhrmann writes that "[the] whole stylistic premise has been to decode what the Moulin Rouge was to the audiences of 1899 and express that same thrill and excitement in a way to which contemporary movie-goers can relate." With that in mind, the film takes well-known [[popular music]], mostly drawn from the [[MTV Generation]], and anachronizes it into a tale set in a turn-of-the-century Paris [[cabaret]]. The movie also features editing that several critics compared to a music video, involving swirling camera motion, loud music, dancing, and frenetic cutting. Some of the songs sampled include "Chamma Chamma" from the [[Hindi]] movie ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]'', [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]" (arranged in operatic format), [[David Bowie]]'s rendition of [[Eden Ahbez]]'s "[[Nature Boy (song)|Nature Boy]]", "[[Lady Marmalade]]" by [[Patti LaBelle]] (the [[Christina Aguilera]]/[[Pink (singer)|P!nk]]/[[Mýa]]/[[Lil' Kim]] [[Cover version|cover]] commissioned for the film), [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" and "[[Material Girl]]", [[Elton John]]'s "[[Your Song]]", the [[The Sound of Music (song)|titular number]] of "[[The Sound of Music]]", "[[Roxanne (song)|Roxanne]]" by [[The Police]] (in a [[Tango music|tango]] format using the composition "Tanguera" by [[Mariano Mores]]), and "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], a song rarely used in films. The film uses so much popular music that it took Luhrmann almost two years to secure all the rights to the songs.

==Release and reception==
Originally set for release on [[Christmas]] 2000 as a high-profile Oscar contender, [[20th Century Fox]] eventually moved the release to the following spring so director Luhrmann would have more time during post-production. The film [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1100086/year/2001.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Moulin Rouge! |accessdate=17 October 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> on 9 May – making it the festival's opening title.

Moulin Rouge! received generally positive reviews from critics.

The film holds a rating of 66/100 at [[Metacritic]] based on 35 reviews,<ref>{{cite web|title=Metacritic reviews|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203009/criticreviews|work=Internet Movie Database: Moulin Rouge!|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> and a 76% "Fresh" rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 187 reviews, and a 65% "Fresh" rating, based on 40 "top" reviewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moulin Rouge!

The film was selected by the [[National Board of Review]] as the best film of 2001. It picked up six [[Golden Globe]] nominations including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (for Nicole Kidman), Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (for Ewan McGregor), Best Original Score (for Craig Armstrong), Best Director (for Baz Luhrmann) and Best Song ("Come What May"). It won three including the coveted Best Picture trophy. A few weeks later, it received 13 nominations at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards, making it the most nominated film of the year for that ceremony. It took home three, including Best Supporting Actor for [[Jim Broadbent]].

The film received eight Oscar nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref name="Oscars2002">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/74th-winners.html |title=The 74th Academy Awards (2002) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=19 November 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> The film was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Luhrmann); commenting on this during the Oscar ceremony, host [[Whoopi Goldberg]] remarked, "I guess ''Moulin Rouge!'' just directed itself." The film won the awards for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]].

"Come What May" (the only original song in the film) was disqualified from nomination for an Oscar because it was originally written (but unused) for Luhrmann's previous film ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' and not written expressly for ''Moulin Rouge!''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~aw220/02oscp09.htm |title=Alex's Oscar Column No. 09 for the 74th Annual Academy Awards | last=Fung | first=Alex |date=9 February 2002 | accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Baz Luhrmann's trippy pop culture pastiche from 2001 was an aesthetically arresting ode to poetry, passion, and Elton John. It was so good, we'll forgive him for ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]].''"<ref>Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (11 December 2009), "THE 100 Greatest MOVIES, TV SHOWS, ALBUMS, BOOKS, CHARACTERS, SCENES, EPISODES, SONGS, DRESSES, MUSIC VIDEOS, AND TRENDS THAT ENTERTAINED US OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS".

The "Elephant Love Medley" also contains additional original lyrics that are unattributed.

In the Blu-ray release, it was revealed that the song that was planned to open the film was originally [[Cat Stevens]]' "[[Father and Son (song)|Father and Son]]", sung by Christian where he argues with his father for making him see that he has to go to [[Paris]] in order to make his dreams come true. [[Cat Stevens]] refused the permission for using the song in the film, therefore the song was changed for "[[Nature Boy (song)|Nature Boy]]".

Two soundtrack albums were released, with the second coming after the first one's massive success. The first volume featured the smash hit single "[[Lady Marmalade]]", performed by [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mýa]] and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]. The first soundtrack, ''[[Moulin Rouge!
