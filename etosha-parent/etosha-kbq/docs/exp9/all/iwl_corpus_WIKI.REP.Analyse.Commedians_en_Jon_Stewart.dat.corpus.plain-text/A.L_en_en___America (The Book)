'''''America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction''''' is a 2004 [[humor]] book written by [[Jon Stewart]] and other writers of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' that parodies and satirizes American politics and worldview. It has won several awards, and generated some controversy.

An updated [[trade paperback]] edition was published in 2006 as a "''Teacher's Edition''," with updated coverage of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] (including [[Samuel Alito]] and [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]], who were appointed after the 2004 book's publication), and [[fact checking]] by Stanley K. Schultz, [[professor emeritus]] of history at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]],<ref>{{cite web

==Description==

''America (The Book)'' was written and edited by [[Jon Stewart]], [[Ben Karlin]], [[David Javerbaum]], and other writers of ''[[The Daily Show]]''. Karlin was the show's [[executive producer]] and Javerbaum its head writer. The book is written as a [[parody]] of a United States [[high school]] [[civics]] [[textbook]], complete with study guides, questions, and class exercises. Also included are scholarly "Were You Aware?" boxes, one of which explains that "the term 'Did You Know' is copyrighted by a rival publisher". The book provides discussion questions to mock history study guide books, with ridiculous questions such as: "Would you rather be a king or slave? Why or why not?". It pokes fun at the [[Politics of the United States|American political system]], and includes a chapter caricaturing stereotypical American views of the rest of the world.

People affiliated with ''The Daily Show'' during publication in 2004, such as [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Samantha Bee]], and [[Ed Helms]], contributed small articles. Bee's articles related the "Canadian view point" on topics, such as "We have media in Canada, too!". Stephen Colbert gives heavily biased viewpoints on topics such as [[Warren G. Harding]] (who is often considered [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|one of the worst American presidents]]). Ed Helms wrote articles stating what he would do if afforded certain positions of power and references the death of a specific individual for reasons never revealed to the reader.

One page contains mock campaign stickers for various candidates. These include "Lifelong Democrat Retired [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] [[Jew]]s for [[Pat Buchanan|Buchanan]]" (referencing the [[butterfly ballot]] fracas that brought about the [[Florida election recount|2000 recount in Florida]]), "I cast my [[Three-fifths compromise|five slaves' three votes]] for [[James K. Polk]]" and "Undecided Voters for Candidate". Another has "[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] in '68" in large print, then in much smaller print "Because otherwise, in four years, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon's]] boys will be caught breaking into the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office]] trying to sabotage their opponents, [[Watergate scandal|creating unprecedented scandal]] and ushering in an era of cynicism that will shape politics for decades to come. Call it a hunch. So, to repeat: Humphrey in '68".

Appearing shortly before the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 US presidential election]], the book originally included several pages of an "Election Guide" making fun of both candidates. Printings of the book made after the election do not have this insert.

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' (PW) chose it as its "Book of the Year"; it noted that "in a year defined by political [[polemic]]s, it seems fitting that PW's Book of the Year be one in which the authors survey the entire political system and laugh." The [[audiobook]] version won the [[Grammy Awards of 2005#Comedy|Grammy Award]] in 2005 for "[[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]]." The book, published in September 2004, remained a bestseller even after the election. In addition to ''America (The Audiobook)'', it has also spun off into ''America (The Calendar)''.

==Controversy==

The fifth chapter contains obviously doctored photographs with the heads of then-current [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justices superimposed on appropriately aged naked bodies. An adjacent page invites the reader to cover each justice with a cutout of his or her robe to "restore their dignity". [[Wal-Mart]] canceled its order for ''America (The Book)'' because it "felt a majority of our customers would not be comfortable with the image".<ref name="can">

Cartoonist [[Bruce Tinsley]]'s objected to [[Mallard Fillmore#Parody in America (The Book)|the book's parody]] of his comic strip ''[[Mallard Fillmore]]'', which appears among six other cartoon parodies, captioned as dating from 1998. Tinsley referenced the parody in the July 5–8, 2005 editions of ''Fillmore'', with the title character stating that Jon Stewart "tried to deceive people into thinking" that the book's phony ''Fillmore'' was real. The strip went on to imply that Stewart was a pedophile.<ref>
