Hannity hosted his first talk radio show in 1989 at the volunteer college station at [[UC Santa Barbara]], [[KCSB-FM]], while working as a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time;<ref name="wdbo_bio">{{cite web |url=http://wdbo.com/hannity/biography.html |title=Hannity Bio |accessdate=2008-10-13 |publisher=[[The Sean Hannity Show]] at [[WDBO (AM)|WDBO]]}}</ref> Regarding his first show, Hannity has said, "I wasn't good at it. I was terrible."<ref>{{cite news |title='Hannitization' Of America |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/21/sunday/main619045.shtml |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref> Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year by station managers. This was after two shows featuring the book ''The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS'' by Gene Antonio; among other remarks made during the broadcast, Hannity told a lesbian caller "I feel sorry for your child."<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Cohen |authorlink=Jeff Cohen (media critic) |title=Cable News Confidential: My Misadventures in Corporate Media |publisher=Polipoint Press |location= |year=2006 |pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=j1L_Wks6mocC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA85,M1 85] |isbn=0-9760621-6-X}}</ref> The station later reversed its decision to dismiss Hannity due in part to a campaign conducted by the Santa Barbara Chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Hannity decided against returning to KCSB.<ref name="www.fair.org">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Rendall |title=An Aggressive Conservative vs. a 'Liberal to be Determined' |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1158 |work=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting |date=November–December 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref>

After leaving KCSB, Hannity placed an ad in radio publications presenting himself as "the most talked about college radio host in America." Radio station [[WVNN (AM)|WVNN]] in [[Athens, Alabama]] (part of the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] market) then hired him to be the afternoon talk show host.<ref name="wdbo_bio"/> From Huntsville, he moved to [[WGST]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in 1992, filling the slot vacated by [[Neal Boortz]], who had moved to competing station [[WSB (AM)|WSB]]. In September 1996 Fox News co-founder [[Roger Ailes]] hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title ''Hannity and LTBD'' ("liberal to be determined").<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20061109203543/http://www.alan.com/staff/alan.htm</ref> [[Alan Colmes]] was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as ''Hannity & Colmes''.

Later that year Hannity left WGST for New York, where WABC had him substitute for their afternoon [[drive time]] host during Christmas week. In January 1997, WABC put Hannity on the air full-time, giving him the late night time slot. WABC then moved Hannity to the same drive time slot he had filled temporarily a little more than a year earlier.  Hannity has been on WABC's afternoon time slot since January 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wabcradio.com/showdj.asp?DJID=1725 |title=Sean Hannity is a multi-media superstar, spending four hours a day every day reaching out to millions of Americans on radio, television and internet |accessdate=2008-10-13 |publisher=[[WABC (AM)|WABC]]}}</ref>

Conservative [[Cal Thomas]] and liberal [[Bob Beckel]], in their book ''Common Ground'', describe Hannity as a leader of the pack among broadcasting political polarizers, which following [[James Q. Wilson]] they define as those who have "an intense commitment to a candidate, a culture, or an ideology that sets people in one group definitively apart from people in another, rival group."<ref>{{cite book |first=Cal |last=Thomas |authorlink=Cal Thomas |author2=Bob Beckel  |title=Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=3–6 |isbn=0-06-123634-9}}</ref>

===Television===
{{See also|Hannity & Colmes|Hannity's America|Hannity}}
Hannity was a co-host of ''Hannity & Colmes'', an American political "point-counterpoint"-style television program on the Fox News Channel featuring Hannity and [[Alan Colmes]] as co-hosts. Hannity presented the conservative point of view with Colmes providing the liberal viewpoint. Critics argued that the show highlighted Hannity's views and those of conservative guests over Colmes' and those of liberal guests.<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1158 An Aggressive Conservative vs. a "Liberal to be Determined"] by Steve Rendall, [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], November/December 2003</ref>

Hannity had on air clashes with show guests such as [[Fr. Thomas J. Euteneuer]] of [[Human Life International]], who challenged Hannity on his public dissent from the Catholic Church on the issue of contraception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=usTWwSbpWRc |title=YouTube – Hannity's Gospel |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070318001552/http://video1.washingtontimes.com/culture/2007/03/hannity_at_odds_with_catholic.html |last=McCain |first=Robert Stacy |title=Hannity at Odds with Catholic Doctrine |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Washington Times |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref> Hannity stated that if the Catholic Church were to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] him over the issue, he would join [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]].<ref>Royal, Robert.

In January 2007, Hannity began a new Sunday night television show on Fox News, ''Hannity's America''.

In November 2008, Colmes announced his departure from ''Hannity & Colmes''.  After the show's final broadcast on January 9, 2009, Hannity took over the time slot with his own new show, ''Hannity'', which has a format similar to ''Hannity's America''.

The opening theme music for the ''Sean Hannity Show'' is "[[Independence Day (Martina McBride song)|Independence Day]]" by [[Martina McBride]] followed by "[[Eye of the Tiger]]" by [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]]. The writer of McBride's song, Gretchen Peters, has stated publicly in interview that the song is about domestic abuse, not political values and though she cannot stop Hannity from using the song, she disagrees with its use but uses the royalties he pays to donate to her own causes.<ref>http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7957</ref> As of May 2014 the theme song was changed to the line "This is how we roll" from the song of the same name by Florida Georgia Line.
