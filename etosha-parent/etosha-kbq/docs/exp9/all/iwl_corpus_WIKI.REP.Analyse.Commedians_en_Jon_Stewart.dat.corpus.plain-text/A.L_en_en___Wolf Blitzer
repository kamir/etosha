'''Wolf Isaac Blitzer''' (born March 22, 1948) is a [[journalist]] and [[television news]] [[news presenter|anchor]], who has been a [[CNN]] reporter since 1990. He is the host of ''[[The Situation Room]]'' and the daytime show ''[[CNN Newsroom|Wolf]]''. Blitzer also serves as the network's lead political anchor.

==Early life==
Blitzer was born in [[Augsburg]], [[Germany]],<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=J3fhcUnCC1AC&lpg=PA21&ots=tXiNSsL6GN&dq=&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q=&f=false Encyclopedia of television news], By Michael D.

Wolf Blitzer Answers Questions About News [Television transcript] CNN Talkback Live</ref> He was raised in [[Buffalo, New York]]. Blitzer graduated from [[Kenmore West Senior High School]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[history]] from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] in 1970. While there, he was a brother of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]]. In 1972, he received a [[Master of Arts]] in [[international relations]] from the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Johns Hopkins SAIS|School of Advanced International Studies]]. While at Johns Hopkins, Blitzer studied abroad at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he learned [[Hebrew]].<ref>''New York Magazine''. Feb 11, 1991. Page 36.</ref>

===Name===
Blitzer has said that he has frequently been asked about his name, which has been characterized as seemingly ''made-for-TV''.<ref>Sheridan, Patricia (October 3, 2005). "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05276/581641.stm "Breakfast with..."]. ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''. Retrieved December 6, 2005.</ref>
<!-- Highly tangential and trivial: 
In a [[Wayne's World]] [[Saturday Night Live]] sketch which was aired during the ''Persian [[Gulf War]]'', Wayne and Garth picked Blitzer as having the "worst name" of any war correspondent, with Garth remarking, "It's so obvious the guy made it up for the war!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/90/90kwaynesworld.phtml|title=Wayne's World|work=jt.org}}</ref>-->
Blitzer explains that his surname goes back for generations, and his first name, 'Wolf', is the same first name as his maternal grandfather.

In writing for several [[Israel]]i newspapers in Washington, Blitzer has used the names Zev Blitzer and Zev Barak.<ref name= bwj /> Zev (זאב) is the [[Hebrew]] word for "wolf" and Barak (ברק) is the [[Hebrew]] word for "lightning" (which in German/Yiddish is Blitz).

==Career==

===Washington and Jerusalem===
Blitzer began his career in journalism in the early 1970s in the [[Tel Aviv]] bureau of the [[Reuters]] news agency. In 1973 he caught the eye of ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' editor [[Ari Rath]], who hired Blitzer as a Washington correspondent for the [[English language]] [[Israel]]i newspaper. Blitzer remained with the ''Jerusalem Post'' until 1990, covering both American politics and developments in the Middle East.<ref name=jpost>{{Cite news|title = Wolf Blitzer, 'Symbol of Integrity', Leaves Post For Cable Network Job|last = Makovsky|first = David|publisher = The Jerusalem Post|date = 1990-04-29}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Blitzer also contributed to the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC) as the editor of their monthly publication, the ''[[Near East Report]]''.<ref>[http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=10753 The American Spectator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeast.org/read.cgi?category=Magazine&num=27&standalone=&month=1&year=2001&function=text|title=MiddleEast.org - Mid-East Realities|work=middleeast.org}}</ref> While at AIPAC, Blitzer's writing focused on Middle East affairs as they relate to [[United States foreign policy]].

At an April 1977 [[White House]] press conference, Blitzer asked [[Egypt]]ian leader [[Anwar Sadat]] why Egyptian scholars, athletes and journalists were not permitted to visit Israel. Sadat, somewhat taken aback, responded that such visits would be possible after an end to the state of belligerence between the two nations. This was Sadat's first public acknowledgment that peace between Egypt and Israel was possible. In November of that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel, and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries from the first joint Israeli-Egyptian press conference in 1977 to the final negotiations that would lead to the signing of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] two years later.<ref name=jpost/>

Fluent in [[Hebrew]], in this period Blitzer also published articles for several Israeli-based newspapers. Under the name Zev Blitzer, he wrote for ''[[Al HaMishmar]]''; using the name Zev Barak, he had work published in ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]''.<ref name= bwj>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Between Washington and Jerusalem''. 1985, page ix</ref>

In 1985, Blitzer published his first book, ''Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1985). The text outlined his personal development as a reporter, and the relations between the United States and Israel.

===Jonathan Pollard===
In 1986, he became known for his coverage of the arrest and trial of [[Jonathan Pollard]], an American Jew who was charged with spying for Israel.<ref name=jpost/> Blitzer was the first journalist to interview Pollard, and he would later write a book about the Pollard Affair titled ''Territory of Lies''.<ref name=pollard>{{Cite news|publisher = Washington Post|title = The American Who Loved Israel Too Much: Book Review|last = Luxenberg|first = Steven|date = 1989-05-21}}</ref> In the book, Blitzer writes that Pollard contacted him because he had been reading Blitzer's byline for years, and because Blitzer "had apparently impressed him as someone who was sympathetic".<ref>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Territory of Lies''. 1989, page xv</ref> Pollard also hoped that Blitzer would help him "reach the people of Israel, as well as the American Jewish community."<ref>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Territory of Lies''. 1989, page xix</ref>

Blitzer's interview with Pollard was controversial in the context of the legal action against him, as it was construed by some media voices as a possible violation of the terms of Pollard's plea deal, which forbade media contact. Blitzer's subsequent book about the affair was included in ''[[The New York Times]]'' list of "Notable Books of the Year" for 1989.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher = The New York Times|date = 1989-12-13|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDF163BF930A35751C1A96F948260|title = Notable Books of the Year|accessdate=10 April 2008}}</ref> In its review, the ''Times'' praised the book as "lucid and highly readable" and called Blitzer's judgment of Israeli officials "harsh but fair".<ref>{{Cite news|title = The Spy from South Bend|last = Pear|first = Robert|date = 1989-05-07|publisher = The New York Times|format = Book Review|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DA1F3DF934A35756C0A96F948260}}</ref>

A review in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' was more critical, prompting a letter from Blitzer accusing the reviewer of making several inaccurate statements. Reviewer Robert I. Friedman responded to Blitzer's criticism by characterizing ''Territory of Lies'' as "a slick piece of damage control that would make [Blitzer's] former employers at AIPAC (not to mention Israel's Defense Ministry) proud."<ref>{{Cite news|publisher = New York Review of Books|last = Friedman|first = Robert|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3751|title = 'Territory of Lies'|format = letter by Blitzer, response by Friedman|date = 1990-02-01|accessdate=16 February 2007}}</ref>
