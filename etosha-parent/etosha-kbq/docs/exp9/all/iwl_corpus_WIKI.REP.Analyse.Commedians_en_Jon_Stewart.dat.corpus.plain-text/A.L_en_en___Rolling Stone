'''''Rolling Stone''''' is a fortnightly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by [[Jann Wenner]], who is still the magazine's editor-in-chief, and music critic [[Ralph J. Gleason]]. The magazine was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music.<ref name="samuelfreedman.com"/> In recent years, the magazine has resumed its traditional mix of content.

==History==
''Rolling Stone Magazine'' was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by [[Jann Wenner]]. To get the magazine off the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his own family and from the parents of his soon-to-be wife, Michell Palmer.<ref name="Wenner's world">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/04/20/wenner/print.html|title=The evolution of Jann Wenner: How the ultimate '60s rock groupie built his fantasy into a media empire|last=Weir|first=David|author2=Salon people.com |date=April 20, 1999|work=Wenner's world|publisher=''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' |accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> The first issue carried a cover date of November 9, 1967<ref>{{Cite episode  | title = Pable Pawncasso  | episodelink = List of Pawn Stars episodes#Season 4  | series = Pawn Stars  | serieslink = Pawn Stars

Wenner stated in the first issue that the title of the magazine referred to the 1950 blues song, "[[Rollin' Stone]]", recorded by [[Muddy Waters]], the rock and roll band [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Bob Dylan]]'s hit single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".<ref group=a>"You're probably wondering what we're trying to do. It's hard to say: sort of a magazine and sort of a newspaper. The name of it is ''Rolling Stone'' which comes from an old saying, "A rolling stone gathers no moss." [[Muddy Waters]] used the name for [[Rollin' Stone|a song he wrote]]. [[The Rolling Stones]] took their name from Muddy's song. "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" was the title of Bob Dylan's first rock and roll record. We have begun a new publication reflecting what we see are the changes in rock and roll and the changes related to rock and roll."—Jann Wenner, ''Rolling Stone'', November 9, 1967, p. 2</ref><ref name="Deep">{{Cite book  | last = Palmer  | first = Robert  | authorlink =   | title = Deep Blues  | publisher = Penguin Books  | year = 1981  | location =   | page = 104  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 0-14-006223-8}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' initially identified with and reported the [[hippie]] [[counterculture]] of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the era]]. However, the magazine distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'', embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the [[underground press]]. In the very first edition of the magazine, Wenner wrote that ''Rolling Stone'' "is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces."

In the 1970s, ''Rolling Stone'' began to make a mark with its political coverage, with the likes of [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]] journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]] writing for the magazine's political section. Thompson first published his most famous work ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'', where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005. In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including [[Cameron Crowe]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]], [[Joe Eszterhas]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[P. J. O'Rourke]]. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories, including that of the [[Patty Hearst]] abduction odyssey. One interviewer, speaking for a large number of his peers, said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus, describing it as a "[[rite of passage]]".<ref name="samuelfreedman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelfreedman.com/articles/culture/ust_rolling.html|title=Literary 'Rolling Stone' sells out to male titillation|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G. |date=2002|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref>

In 1977, the magazine moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City. Editor Jann Wenner said San Francisco had become "a cultural backwater."<ref>Temple, Charles (April 18, 2009) [http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Rolling-Stone-closes-last-S-F-office-3164870.php "Rolling Stone closes last S.F. office."]. San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved Aug 13, 2014.)</ref>

During the 1980s, the magazine began to shift towards being a general "entertainment" magazine. Music was still a dominant topic, but there was increasing coverage of celebrities in television, films and the pop culture of the day. The magazine also initiated its annual "Hot Issue" during this time.

''Rolling Stone'' was initially known for its musical coverage and for Thompson's political reporting. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.<ref name="samuelfreedman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.samuelfreedman.com/articles/culture/ust_rolling.html|title=Literary 'Rolling Stone' sells out to male titillation|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G. |date=Date TK, 2002|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> In recent years, the magazine has resumed its traditional mix of content, including in-depth political stories. It has also expanded content to include coverage of financial and banking issues. As a result, the magazine has seen its circulation increase and its reporters invited as experts to network television programs of note.<ref>Bill Moyers, [http://billmoyers.com/segment/matt-taibbi-and-yves-smith-on-the-follies-of-big-banks-and-government/ ''Matt Taibbi and Yves Smith on the Follies of Big Banks and Government''], June 22, 2012</ref>

The printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid newspaper format, with no staples, black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10″×12″) magazine. As of edition of October 30, 2008, ''Rolling Stone'' has had a smaller, standard-format magazine size.<ref>Rolling Stone ends large format after 4 decades, by Anick Jesdanun, The Associated Press, New York, Life, Tue, October 14, 2008 [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-10-14-rollingstone_N.htm]</ref>

===2000s===
[[File:Rolling Stone February 1 2012 cover.jpg|thumb|[[Cee Lo Green]], [[Adam Levine]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Blake Shelton]], on the cover of the February 1, 2012, issue of ''Rolling Stone'']]
After years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s, [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]] and [[Matt Taibbi]].

In 2005, [[Dana Leslie Fields]], former publisher of ''Rolling Stone'', who had worked at the magazine for 17 years, was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame.<ref>Media Industry News http://www.minonline.com/awards/seoy/SEOYwinners_pr.pdf</ref>

In 2009, Taibbi unleashed an acclaimed series of scathing reports on the financial meltdown of the time. He famously described [[Goldman Sachs]] as "a great vampire squid."

Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010. ''Rolling Stone'' caused a controversy in the [[White House]] by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]] entitled, "The Runaway General",<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Hastings |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236 |title=The Runaway General – Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the real enemy: The wimps in the White House |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> quoting criticism of General [[Stanley A.

In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts, after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom. His article, ''Invasion of the Home Snatchers'' also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court.<ref>Taibbi, Matt, [http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/matt-taibbi-courts-helping-banks-screw-over-homeowners-20101110/ ''Invasion of the Home Snatchers''], ''Rolling Stone'', November 10, 2010</ref><ref>Charney, April, "that day... a stain on Jacksonville" statement, December 14, 2011 ''Occupy Jax advised by foreclosure attorney'', 10:30–11:00, YouTube video uploaded December 15, 2011 {{YouTube|AYtbCfIrR3U}}</ref>

In January 2012, the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings' book just prior to publication. The book, ''The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan'', provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they become embroiled in such wars. It has been described as a boozy, sexy account of the misadventures of America's "most notorious killers".{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The book reached Amazon's bestseller list in the first 48 hours of release, and it received generally favorable reviews. [[Salon (website)|Salon's]] [[Glenn Greenwald]] described it as "superb," "brave" and "eye-opening."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-rose-garden |title=Michael Hastings on war journalists |publisher=Salon.com |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, Taibbi, through his coverage of the [[Libor scandal|LIBOR scandal]],<ref>Taibbi, Matt, [http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/why-is-nobody-freaking-out-about-the-libor-banking-scandal-20120703#ixzz1zcu88hJ9/ "Why is Nobody Freaking Out About the LIBOR Scandal?"]. ''Rolling Stone'', July 3, 2012</ref> emerged as an expert on that topic, which lead to media appearances outside ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/segment/matt-taibbi-and-yves-smith-on-the-follies-of-big-banks-and-government/|title=Matt Taibbi and Yves Smith on the Follies of Big Banks and Government|work=BillMoyers.com|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.capitalismwithoutfailure.com/2012/07/matt-taibbi-eliott-spitzer-and-dennis.html/ July 4, 2012 Viewpoint with Elliot Sputzer]</ref>

On November 9, 2012, the magazine published its first Spanish-language section on Latino music and culture, in the issue dated November 22.<ref>Newman, Andrew Adam (November 6, 2012).

==Website==
''Rolling Stone'''s website features selected current articles, reviews, blogs, MP3s and other features, such as searchable and free encyclopedic articles about artists, with images and sometimes sound clips of their work. The articles and reviews are sometimes in a revised form of the published versions.  The website also carries political and cultural articles and entries selected from the magazine's archives. 

The site at one time had an extensive message-board forum. By the late 1990s, this had developed into a thriving community, with a large number of regular members and contributors worldwide. However, the site was also plagued with numerous [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolls]] and malicious code-hackers, who vandalized the forum substantially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsjunior.proboards18.com/index.cgi?board=tribunal&action=display&thread=1085021884&page=19 |title=RS.com Castaways – Troll Tribunal |publisher=Rsjunior.proboards18.com |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>  The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004, then began a new, much more limited message board community on their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. In March 2008, the website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010. 

''Rolling Stone'' devotes one of its table of contents pages to promoting material currently appearing on its website, listing detailed links to the items.  The magazine also has a page at MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. 

On April 19, 2010, the website was updated drastically and now features the complete archives of ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.rollingstone.com |title=Rolling Stone All Access |publisher=Archive.rollingstone.com |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> The archive was first launched under a for-pay model, but has since transitioned to a free-with-print-subscription model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sub.rollingstone.com/allaccess/subscribe |title=Rolling Stone All Access-Subscribe to Rolling Stone |publisher=Sub.rollingstone.com |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> In the spring of 2012, ''Rolling Stone'' launched a [[federated search]] feature which searches both the website and the archive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/search?q=wiki |title=Federated Rolling Stone search for 'wiki' |publisher=Rollingstone.com |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Restaurant==
In December 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that the owners of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine planned to open a ''Rolling Stone'' restaurant in the [[Hollywood and Highland Center|Hollywood & Highland Center]] in Hollywood in the spring of 2010.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vincent|first=Roger|title=Rolling Stone to launch restaurant chain in L.A|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/04/business/la-fi-rolling-stone4-2009dec04|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 22, 2010|date=December 4, 2009}}</ref> The expectation was that the restaurant could become the first of a national chain if it was successful.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://losangeles.grubstreet.com/2010/05/how_rolling_stones_hollywood_a.html |title=How Rolling Stone's Hollywood and Highland Restaurant Will Differ From Hard Rock Cafe's |date=May 24, 2010 |work= Grub Street Los Angeles (New York magazine) |author=Hadley Tomicki}}</ref> As of November 2010, the "soft opening" of the restaurant was planned for December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://la.eater.com/archives/2010/12/08/two_floors_of_fun_at_rolling_stone_restaurant_and_lounge.php |title=Two Floors of Fun at Rolling Stone Restaurant and Lounge |date=November 8, 2010 |publisher=Eater.com |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref> In 2011, the restaurant was open for lunch and dinner as well as a full night club downstairs on the weekends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstonela.com|title=Rolling Stone Restaurant|accessdate=May 31, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110728035128/http://www.rollingstonela.com/|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref> However, the restaurant closed around February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tomicki |first=Hadley |url=http://losangeles.grubstreet.com/2013/02/rolling-stone-restaurant-closes-hollywood.html |title=But It's All Over Now: Rolling Stone Restaurant Folds in Hollywood – Grub Street Los Angeles |publisher=Losangeles.grubstreet.com |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref>

==Criticism==
One major criticism of ''Rolling Stone'' involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the ''Rolling Stone'' list of the "99 Greatest Songs" as an example of "unrepentant [[rockist]] fogeyism".<ref name="Popism">May 9, 2006. Does hating rock make you a music critic? Jody Rosen. Slate. [http://slate.com/id/2141418/ Article charging "RS" with "fogeyism."]</ref> In further response to this issue, rock critic [[Jim DeRogatis]], a former ''Rolling Stone'' editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine's lists in a book called ''Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics'' (ISBN 1-56980-276-9), which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.<ref>July 4, 2004.

''Rolling Stone'' magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed, and for frequent use of the 3.5 star rating. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine critics during the band's most active years in the 1970s, but by 2006, a [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] on [[Led Zeppelin]] honored them as "the Heaviest Band of All Time".<ref name="shout">{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |title=Documentation of attempt to change reviews |publisher=Shoutmouth.com |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070630190730/http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}</ref> A critic for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine described a conference at which 1984's ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' was scrutinized. As he described it, "The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?"<ref name="Popism">{{cite web|last=Rosen |first=Jody |url=http://slate.com/id/2141418/ |title=Does hating rock make you a music critic? |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&nbsp;– Slate.com |date=May 9, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

The hiring of former ''[[FHM]]'' editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that ''Rolling Stone'' had lost its credibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salon.com/ent/feature/2002/06/28/rollingstone/index.html |title=The death of Rolling Stone |publisher=Salon.com |date=June 28, 2002 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

The 2003 ''Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time'' article, which named only two female musicians, resulted in ''[[Venus Zine]]'' answering with their own list entitled, "The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time">{{cite web|last=Thurston |first=Bonnie |url=http://www.venuszine.com/articles/music/2575/The_Greatest_Female_Guitarists_of_All_Time |title=The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Venus Zine |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

===UVA rape story===
{{Main|A Rape on Campus}}
On December 5, 2014, ''Rolling Stone'''s managing editor, Will Dana, apologized for a story that was run about an alleged [[gang rape]] on the campus of the University of Virginia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Erdely|first1=Sabrina|title=A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Struggle for Justice at UVA|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20150404090041/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-20141119|accessdate=2015-03-14|publisher=Rollingstone.com (web.archive.org)|date=November 19, 2014}}</ref> Separate inquiries by Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity accused by ''Rolling Stone'' of facilitating the rape, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed major errors and discrepancies in the report. Reporter [[Sabrina Erdely]]'s story was subject to intense media criticism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schow |first=Ashe |date=December 3, 2014 |title=If false, Rolling Stone story could set rape victims back decades |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/if-false-rolling-stone-story-could-set-rape-victims-back-decades/article/2556895 |newspaper=[[The Washington Examiner]] |location= |accessdate=December 5, 2014 }}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' and ''Boston Herald'' issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired.<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|date=December 7, 2014 |title=Apparently, this Rolling Stone gathers no facts |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/columnists/adriana_cohen/2014/12/adriana_cohen_apparently_this_rolling_stone_gathers_no |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |location= |accessdate=December 7, 2014 }}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' subsequently issued three apologies for the story. Some suggested that legal action against the magazine by persons accused of the rape might result.<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|date=December 5, 2014 |title=Civil, Criminal Lawsuits: Possible Outcomes of Rolling Stone Expose |url=http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/CBS19-Legal-Analyst-Discusses-Legal-Ramifications-of-Rolling-Stone-Discrepancies-284934851.html?ref=851 |newspaper=[[WCAV]] |location= |accessdate=December 5, 2014 }}</ref>

''Rolling Stone'' commissioned an outside investigation of the story and its problems by the Dean of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia School of Journalism]]. The report uncovered complete journalistic failure in the UVA story and institutional problems with reporting at ''Rolling Stone''. ''Rolling Stone'' retracted the story on April 5, 2015.<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-what-went-wrong-20150405?page=5</ref>  On April 6, 2015, following the investigation and retraction of the story, Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against ''Rolling Stone'', including claims of defamation.<ref>http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/04/07/sizing-up-phi-kappa-psis-potential-suit-against-rolling-stone/</ref>

On 12 May 2015, UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school, filed a $7.5 million defmation lawsuit in Charlottesville Circuit Court against ''Rolling Stone'' and Erdely, claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress.  Said the filing, "''Rolling Stone'' and Erdely’s highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake.  They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts."<ref>Shapiro, T.

==In popular culture==
* "[[The Cover of the Rolling Stone]]" is a 1973 song satirizing success in the music business. It was first recorded by [[Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show]], who subsequently did get on the cover of the magazine, albeit in caricature rather than a photograph.
* [[George Harrison]]'s 1975 song "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)|This Guitar]]", a lyrical sequel to his [[Beatles]] track "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", references the magazine in its second verse: "''Learned to get up when I fall / Can even climb'' Rolling Stone ''walls''". The song was written in response to some unduly harsh reviews from ''Rolling Stone'' and other publications for Harrison's 1974 North American tour and the ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' album.<ref>Simon Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music of George Harrison'', Hal Leonard (Milwaukee, WI, 2006), pp 181–82,</ref><ref>Alan Clayson, ''George Harrison'', Sanctuary (London, 2003), p. 350.</ref>
* In [[Stephen King]]'s 1980 novel ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'', the protagonist chooses ''Rolling Stone'' as an unbiased independent media source, through which she can expose the government agency hunting her.  However, in the [[Firestarter (film)|film adaptation]], the protagonist chooses ''[[The New York Times]]''.
* 1985 film'' [[Perfect (film)|Perfect]]'' depicts [[John Travolta]] as a reporter for ''Rolling Stone'', covering the health club fad of the time. Jann Wenner plays editor-in-chief "Mark Roth".
* 2000 film ''[[Almost Famous]]'' portrayed fictional 15-year-old aspiring rock journalist writing for ''Rolling Stone''. The semi-autobiographical film was written and directed by former ''Rolling Stone'' columnist [[Cameron Crowe]] and featured portrayals of publisher [[Jann Wenner]] ([[Eion Bailey]]), editor [[Ben Fong-Torres]] ([[Terry Chen]]), David Felton ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and others in ''Rolling Stone'''s 1970s San Francisco offices. Wenner also had a cameo in the film as a man reading a newspaper in a taxi.
*2002 song, "[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]" by pop punk band [[Good Charlotte]] refer to the excesses of modern celebrities and the influence of the magazine, in the first verse: "''All they do is piss and moan / Inside the Rolling Stone / Talking about how hard life can be''". Their song "[[I Just Wanna Live]]" (2004) mentions the magazine as well.
