'''''The Hollywood Reporter''''' ('''''THR''''') is a multiplatform American media brand founded in 1930 and focusing on the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[motion picture industry|motion picture]], [[television]], and [[entertainment]] industries, as well as Hollywood's intersection with fashion, [[finance]], [[law]], [[technology]], lifestyle, and [[politics]]. Headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], ''THR'' is now part of Guggenheim Digital Media, a group of properties that also includes media entities ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''[[Adweek]]'', [[Back Stage]], Sonicbids, the [[Clio Awards]] and the Film Expo Group.  Under [[Janice Min]], ''THR'' was relaunched in 2010 as a weekly [[Wide-format printer|large-format print]] magazine with a revamped, continuously updated [[website]] as well as mobile and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] editions.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' is one of the two major publications (based on market size) focused on Hollywood, the other being ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Both publications have expanded to cover what is more broadly called the entertainment industry.

==History==
''The Hollywood Reporter'' was founded in September 1930 as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper by [[William Wilkerson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Billy Wilkerson|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/billy-wilkerson|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref> When Wilkerson died in 1962, his widow, [[Tichi Wilkerson Kassel]], took over as editor and publisher; in 1988, she sold ''THR'' to the trade publisher BPI. ''THR'' was bought by the Dutch publishing consortium [[Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen]] in 2006, by the [[Nielsen Company]] in 2007 and, in 2009, by [[Prometheus Global Media]], a new company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and [[Guggenheim Partners]]. In 2013, Guggenheim acquired Pluribus's stake and renamed ''THR''{{'}}s parent company Guggenheim Digital Media.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raphael|first=TJ|title=Yahoo Exec Tapped To Head Prometheus Global Media|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2013/yahoo-exec-tapped-head-prometheus-global-media#.Uk2iOGRVSK9|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>

==Ownership changes==
Wilkerson ran ''The Hollywood Reporter'' until his death in 1962, when his wife, [[Tichi Wilkerson Kassel|Tichi Wilkerson]], took over as publisher and editor-in-chief. She sold the paper on April 11, 1988 to trade publishers BPI for $26.7 million.<ref>{{cite web|author=A. DONALD ANDERSON; A. Donald Anderson is a writer based in Los Angeles. |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDF1530F934A3575BC0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Hollywood's Version of Trade Wars |publisher=New York Times |date=August 7, 1988|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> Teri Ritzer was the last editor under Wilkerson. She began the paper's modernization by bringing newspaper editors into what was essentially a Hollywood wannabe newsroom.

BPI's publisher, Robert J. Dowling, brought in Alex Ben Block in 1990 and editorial quality of both news and specials was steadily improved. Ritzer and Block dampened much of the rah-rah coverage and [[cronyism]] that had infected the paper under Wilkerson. After Ben Block left, former film editor at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Anita Busch, was brought in as editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with ''Variety''. Tony Uphoff assumed the publisher position in November 2005. ''The Reporter'' was acquired, along with the rest of the assets of [[VNU]], in spring 2006 by a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States. Uphoff was replaced in October 2006 by John Kilcullen, who was the publisher of ''Billboard''. Kilcullen was a defendant in Billboard's infamous "dildo" lawsuit, in which he was accused of race discrimination and sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2004/june04/jun21/4_thurs/news1thursday.html |title=Folio Magazine |publisher=Medialifemagazine.com |date=June 24, 2004 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> VNU settled the suit on the courthouse steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/people/2006/0606/billboard_ctv.html |title=CourtTV |publisher=CourtTV |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> Kilcullen "exited" Nielsen in February 2008 "to pursue his passion as an entrepreneur."<ref>{{cite web|author=NIKKI FINKE, Editor in Chief |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/index.php?s=kilcullen&submit=Search |title=DeadlineHollywoodDaily |publisher=DeadlineHollywoodDaily |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>
Matthew King, vice president for content and audience, editorial director Howard Burns, and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006; editor Cynthia Littleton, widely respected throughout the industry, reported directly to Kilcullen. ''The Reporter'' absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at ''Variety'' in March 2007. Web editor Glenn Abel also left after 16 years with the paper.

In January 2007, VNU was purchased by a private equity consortium and renamed [[The Nielsen Company]], whose properties include ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''AdWeek'' and [[A.C. Nielsen]]. Under its new leadership, Nielsen is reported to have made a US$5 million investment in ''The Reporter''.<ref>MediaBistro, November 6, 2007</ref>

In December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and [[Guggenheim Partners]] and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of Congressional Journal the Hill, acquired ''The Hollywood Reporter'' from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company. Richard Beckman, formerly of [[Condé Nast]], was appointed the new company's CEO.

==Editors and publishers==
In April 2007, industry veteran Eric Mika was named to the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Publishing Director of ''The Reporter''. Having previously served as Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Nielsen Business Media's Film and Performing Arts Group and, before that, as Vice President and Managing Director for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Mika assumed responsibility for the general management of sales, marketing and editorial for ''The Hollywood Reporter'', as well as the brand's ancillary products, events, licensing business and partnerships.<ref>Nielsen press release April 23, 2007</ref>

In June 2007, Rose Einstein, former Vice President, Advertising Sales for [[Netflix]] and 25-year veteran of Reed Business Media, was named to the newly created role of Vice President, Associate Publisher to oversee all sales and business development for ''The Reporter''.<ref>Nielsen press release, June 25, 2007</ref> Mika left ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in early 2010.

In July 2007, ''THR'' named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of ''Variety'', where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences.<ref>Nielsen press release, July 30, 2007</ref> After nearly running the publication into the ground, Guider left ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in early 2010.

In April 2010, Lori Burgess was named publisher of ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Burgess had been publisher of ''[[OK!]]'' magazine since October 2008. Michaela Apruzzese was named associate publisher, entertainment, of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in May 2010. Apruzzese served as the director of movie advertising for Los Angeles Times Media Group.

In May 2010, [[Janice Min]] was named Editorial Director. In January 2014, she was promoted to President/Chief Creative Officer with additional oversight of THR's sister brand, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Randy |last=Lewis |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/09/entertainment/la-et-ms-billboard-hollywood-reporter-janice-min-20140109 |title=Billboard shakeup puts Hollywood Reporter's Janice Min in charge - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=January 9, 2014 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

==Print==
[[File:Hollywood Reporter June 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Dwayne Johnson]] on the June 2014 cover]]
The weekly print edition of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' includes profiles, original photography and interviews with entertainment figures; articles about major upcoming releases and product launches; film reviews and [[film festival]] previews; coverage of the latest industry deals, TV ratings, box-office figures and analysis of global entertainment business trends and indicators; photos essays and reports from premieres and other red-carpet events; and the latest on Hollywood fashion and lifestyle.
The flagship print magazine publishes 46 issues a year, plus numerous stand-alone special reports and glossy daily editions produced onsite during major film festivals in cities including [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Toronto Film Festival]], [[Berlin Film Festival]] and [[Busan Film Festival]]. The print addition of the magazine reaches 74,000 people. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://stephenfollows.com/film-industry-press-who-publishes-the-most/|title=Film industry press: Who publishes the most?|author=Stephen Follows|work=Stephen Follows}}</ref>
Some of Hollywood's biggest names have graced the front of the weekly magazine including: [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] standing beside [[Clint Eastwood]]; [[Bill Clinton]] with sports agent [[Casey Wasserman]]; [[Brad Pitt]]; [[Angelina Jolie]]; [[J.J. Abrams]]; [[Tina Fey]] with [[Amy Poehler]]; [[Jack White]]; [[Julianne Moore]]; [[Nicole Kidman]]; [[Glenn Close]]; [[Steven Spielberg]]; [[George Clooney]]; [[Quentin Tarantino]]; [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]; [[Ben Affleck]]; [[Tom Hanks]]; [[Jennifer Lawrence]]; and [[Martin Scorsese]].

''THR'''s editors in recent years have included [[Janice Min]] (2010–present), Elizabeth Guider (2007–2010), Cynthia Littleton (2005–2007), Howard Burns (2001–2006), Anita Busch (1999–2001) and Alex Ben Block (1990–1999).

==Presence on the web==
The ''Reporter'' published a primitive "[[satellite]]" [[Digital data|digital]] edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=CLINARD|first=JOSH|title=Covering the entertainment biz: Hollywood Reporter vs. Variety|url=http://sabew.org/2012/05/covering-the-entertainment-biz-hollywood-reporter-vs-variety/|publisher=SABEW|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium (paid) service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor ''Daily Variety'' took to the web. In 2002, the ''Reporter''{{'}}s website won the [[Jesse H. Neal Award]] for business journalism.

===Post-2010 re-launch===
THR.com, ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s website, re-launched in 2010, offers breaking entertainment news, reviews and blogs; original video content (and film and TV clips) and photo galleries; plus in-depth movie, television, music, awards, style, technology and business coverage. As of August 2013, Comscore measured 12 million unique visitors per month to the site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comscore subscriber data|url=http://www.comscore.com|publisher=[[Comscore]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

===Editors and reporters today===
''The Hollywood Reporter'' has a staff of roughly 150. In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the ''Reporter'' hired the following staff in 2007:

* Todd Cunningham, former assistant managing editor of the ''[[LA Business Journal]]'', as National Editor for ''The Hollywood Reporter'': Premier Edition
* Steven Zeitchik as Senior Writer, based in New York, where he provide news analysis and features for the Premiere Edition
* Melissa Grego, former managing editor of ''[[TV Week]]'', as Editor of HollywoodReporter.com
* Jonathan Landreth as the new Asian bureau chief, in addition to 13 new writers across Asia

However, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and its sister publications: ''Adweek'', ''Brandweek'', ''Editor & Publisher'' and ''Mediaweek.''<ref name="PaidContent">[http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-nielsen-business-media-lays-off-between-40-50-mainly-editorial PaidContent], April 9, 2008.</ref> In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper.<ref name="DeadlineHollywood">[http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/layoffs-at-hollywood-reporter-12-the-staff/ Deadline Hollywood], December 4, 2008.</ref> In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'',<ref name="BroadcastCable">[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114455-Melissa_Grego_Joins_B_C_as_Executive_Editor.php Broadcast & Cable], July 8, 2008</ref> and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, "Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUKTRE5220TJ20090303 | work=Reuters | title=Hollywood studios' trade group faces leaner budget | date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> Staffing at ''THR'' in 2008 saw even further cutbacks with "names from today's tragic bloodletting of ''The Hollywood Reporter'''s staff" adding up quickly in the hard economic times at the end of 2008.<ref name="deadlinehollywooddaily.com">{{cite web|author=NIKKI FINKE, Editor in Chief |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/layoffs-at-hollywood-reporter-12-the-staff/ |title=UPDATE: Layoffs Gut Hollywood Reporter; Variety's Stylephile Victim Of Recession - Deadline.com |publisher=Deadlinehollywooddaily.com |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> "The trade has not only been thin, but only publishing digital version 19 days this holiday season. Film writers Leslie Simmons, Carolyn Giardina, Gregg Goldstein, plus lead TV critic Barry Garron and TV reporter Kimberly Nordyke, also special issues editor Randee Dawn Cohen out of New York and managing editor Harley Lond and international department editor Hy Hollinger, plus Dan Evans, Lesley Goldberg, Michelle Belaski, James Gonzalez were among those chopped from the masthead."<ref name="deadlinehollywooddaily.com"/>

When [[Janice Min]] and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably ''Variety'' film critic [[Todd McCarthy]] after his firing from ''Variety'' in March 2010.

==2010 relaunch==
The 2010 relaunch of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' under then-CEO Richard Beckman was closely chronicled by the national media. After purchasing THR from Guggenheim Partners and Pluribus Capital in 2010, Beckman recruited Min, the former editor-in-chief of [[Us Weekly]], to "eviscerate" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Hollywood Reporter to Become a Weekly Magazine|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/media/13hollywood.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

''The Reporter'' relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, ''[[The New York Times]]'' took note of the many scoops ''THR'' had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its "rarefied demographic". "They managed to change the subject by going weekly… The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here."<ref>{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=An Outsider Making Waves in Hollywood|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/media/30carr.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

By February 2013, the ''Times'' returned to ''THR'', filing a report on a party for [[Academy Award]] nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant [[Spago]]. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the ''Times'' alluded to the fact that many [[Hollywood]] insiders were now referring to ''THR'' as "the new ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''". Ad sales since Min's hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800%.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=From Has-Been to Life of the Party|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/fashion/the-hollywood-reporter-dusts-off-its-party-clothes.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===The Hollywood blacklist===
During the 1940s and 1950s, ''THR'' founder William R. Wilkerson believed that the Screen Writers Guild was one of Hollywood's prime Communist strongholds, and he used his "TradeView" column in the magazine to uncover and condemn the "Communist takeover" of the guild.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holley |first=Val |title=Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7864-1552-6 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C.}}</ref> On July 29, 1946, Wilkerson published a column headlined "A Vote for Joe Stalin". It contained the first industry names on what later became the Hollywood Blacklist and used by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for its 1947 hearings.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wilkerson |first=William |author-link=William Wilkerson |publication-date=1946-07-29 |title=A Vote For Joe Stalin |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter |page=1 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Wilkerson's campaign against purported Communists was widely believed to have sparked the Hollywood blacklist.<ref name="Baum"/>

Wilkerson's son, W.R. Wilkerson III, apologized for the publication's role in the [[blacklist]] in a 65th anniversary ''THR'' article, saying that his father was motivated by revenge for his own thwarted ambition to own a studio.<ref name="Baum">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931|title=Blacklist: THR Addresses Role After 65 Years|last1=Baum|first1=Gary|first2=Daniel |last2=Miller |accessdate=November 30, 2012|date=November 19, 2012|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="Wilerson III">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-billy-wilkersons-son-apologizes-391977|title=Blacklist: Billy Wilkerson's Son Apologizes for Publication's Dark Past|last=Wilerson III|first=W.R.|accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=November 19, 2012|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>

===Deadline.com lawsuit===
In 2011, [[Deadline.com]], a property of [[Penske Media Corporation]], sued ''The Hollywood Reporter'' for more than $5 million, alleging [[copyright infringement]]. In 2013, ''THR''{{'}}s parent company settled the suit. According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars....The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: 'Prometheus admits that ''The Hollywood Reporter'' copied source code from Penske Media Corporation's Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' have apologized to Penske Media.'"<ref>{{cite web|title=Owners of Competing Hollywood Publications Settle Copyright Lawsuit|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324685104578390833241825180.html|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>

==Current status and legacy==
''The Hollywood Reporter'' published out of the same offices on [[Sunset Boulevard]] for more than a half century. Today, the offices are located in [[L.A.]]'s [[Mid-Wilshire]] district.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' sponsors and hosts a number of major industry events and awards ceremonies. It hosted 13 such events in 2012, including the Women in Entertainment Breakfast, where it announced its annual [[Power 100]] list of the industry's most powerful women;<ref>{{cite web|last=CADENAS|first=KERENSA|title=Diane Keaton to be Honored with Sherry Lansing Leadership Award|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/diane-keaton-honored-with-sherry-lansing-leadership-award|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref> the [[Key Art Awards]] (for achievement in entertainment advertising and communications); Power Lawyers Breakfast; Next Gen (honoring the industry's 50 fastest-rising stars and executives age 35 and under); Nominees Night; and the 25 Most Powerful Stylists Luncheon.

===Awards season===
Entertainment-industry awards receive ample coverage from ''The Hollywood Reporter'', both in print and online. The magazine handicaps all the races, profiles the contenders and analyzes the business impact of nominations and wins. THR awards analyst Scott Feinberg analyzes and predicts the [[Emmy]] and [[Academy Award|Oscar]] races (his weekly ''Feinberg Forecast'' is published from late August up to the Academy Awards [[broadcast]]). THR also offers special print editions, such as its annual Oscar and Emmy issues, during respective awards seasons. THR.com features The Race, an awards-coverage blog, which encompasses Race to the Oscars, an app dedicated to Academy Awards coverage for [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms.

===Competition with ''Variety''===
In March 2007, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' surpassed ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.<ref>ABC Publisher's Statement, as compared to Variety and Daily Variety, March 2007</ref>

''[[Daily Variety]]'' and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' both are located on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] along the well-trafficked "Miracle Mile". Staffers often migrate between the papers. ''Variety'' was long established as an entertainment trade paper in [[vaudeville]] circles, [[Tin Pan Alley]] and in the [[Theater District]] of New York City, but it was ''The Hollywood Reporter'' that began covering the developing film business in Hollywood in 1930. ''Variety'' did not start its Hollywood edition until 1933.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' maintains a business association with the home entertainment trade publication ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'', which is owned by Questex Media Group. The alliance includes an exchange of stories when the need arises, and gives ''The Reporter'' access into the home entertainment trade, which ''Variety'' enjoys with its sister publication, the Reed-owned ''Video Business.''

==Awards==
In 2014, "The Hollywood Reporter magazine" was nominated for its first-ever National Magazine Award in the General Excellence category for Special Interest Magazines (magazines who serve "highly defined reader communities")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazine.org/about-asme/pressroom/asme-press-releases/asme/national-magazine-awards-2014-finalists-announced |title=National Magazine Awards 2014 Finalists Announced |date=March 27, 2014 |work=[[American Society of Magazine Editors]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref>
