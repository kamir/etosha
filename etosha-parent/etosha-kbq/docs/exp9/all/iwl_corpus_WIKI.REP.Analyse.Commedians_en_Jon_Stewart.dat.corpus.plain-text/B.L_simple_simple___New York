'''New York''' is one of the 50 [[state]]s of the [[United States|United States of America]]. It was one of the first [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen states]]. It is well known for having the city of the same name, "[[New York City]]", in the southeastern part of the state.

New York is in the [[northeastern United States]], bordered by [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Canada]] on the north, [[Lake Erie]] and [[Canada]] on the [[west]], [[Pennsylvania]] on the west and [[south]], [[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Connecticut]] on the [[east]], and [[New Jersey]] on the south and west of New York City.

New York also has [[Long Island]]. Long Island is a large [[island]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Parts of New York City, [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]], are on Long Island. The larger part of New York, north and northwest of New York City and Long Island, is called "Upstate New York". Some cities in Upstate include [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]],  [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and the state [[capital (city)|capital]] [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. These places became cities because of the [[Erie Canal]]. 

New York City is the largest city in the state, but Albany is the capital. Between 1788 and 1797, the [[New York State Legislature|Legislature]] moved the state capital around between Albany, [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]], and New York City. Albany became the permanent capital from 1797.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=John Austin |title=The Magazine of American History with Notes and Queries |publisher=Historical Publication Co |year=1886 |page=24 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V7hnlOojVAEC&pg=RA1-PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

New York was originally [[New Netherland]], started by the [[Dutch Empire]] in the early 17th century. Late in the century, it surrendered to a British fleet and became part of the [[British Empire]]. Several important battles of the [[American Revolution]] were fought in New York and it joined the new [[United States]]. 

The [[United States Census Bureau]] says that, as of [[2005]], New York had the third most people (population) in the United States, after [[California]] and [[Texas]]. New York's estimated population is 19,297,729.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFPopulation?_event=Search&_name=&_state=04000US36&_county=&_cityTown=&_zip=&_sse=on&_lang=en&pctxt=fph United States Census]</ref>
