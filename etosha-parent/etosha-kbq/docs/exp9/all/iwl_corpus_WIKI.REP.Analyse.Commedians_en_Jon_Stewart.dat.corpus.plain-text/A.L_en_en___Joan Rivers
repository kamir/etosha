'''Joan Alexandra Molinsky'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rivers-joan|title=Joan Rivers|last=Goldman|first=Shalom|work=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> (June 8, 1933&nbsp;– September 4, 2014), known as '''Joan Rivers''', was an American actress, comedian, writer, producer, and television host noted for her often controversial comedic persona—where she was alternately self-deprecating or sharply acerbic, especially toward celebrities and politicians.

Rivers came to prominence in 1965 as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. Hosted by her mentor, [[Johnny Carson]], the show established Rivers' comedic style. In 1986, with her own rival program, ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show with Joan Rivers]]'', Rivers became the first woman to host a late night network television talk show. She subsequently hosted ''[[The Joan Rivers Show]]'' (1989–1993), winning a [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]] for Outstanding Talk Show Host.

As the author of 12 best-selling [[memoir]] and humor books and numerous comedy albums, Rivers was nominated in 1984 for a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Grammy Award]] for her album ''What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?'' and was nominated in 1994 for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] for her performance of the title role in ''Sally Marr...and Her Escorts''. In 2015, Rivers posthumously received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for her book, ''Diary of a Mad Diva''.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/02/08/joan-rivers-wins-a-grammy/23090009/</ref>

In her later years, Rivers was particularly known for conducting comedic interviews with celebrities as they walked the [[red carpet]] at awards shows.<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLs4emOXWKg |title=Joan Rivers' Greatest Red Carpet Moments|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.eonline.com/news/576107/how-joan-rivers-changed-the-red-carpet-interview-forever-with-one-simple-question-watch-her-best-moments |title=How Joan Rivers Changed the Red Carpet Interview Forever With One Simple Question: Watch Her Best Moments!| publisher=[[E!]] |date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref> From 2010 to 2014 Rivers co-hosted the [[E!]] celebrity fashion show ''[[Fashion Police]]'' and starred in reality series ''[[Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?]]'', from 2011 to 2014, with daughter [[Melissa Rivers]]. Rivers marketed a line of jewelry and apparel on the [[QVC]] shopping channel, and was the subject of the documentary ''[[Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work]]'' (2010).

In 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]'' television critic [[Jack Gould]] called Rivers "quite possibly the most intuitively funny woman alive".<ref name="huff12">{{cite news |title=Joan Rivers Honors Robin Williams In Resurfaced Interview |work=Huffington Post|date=September 5, 2014|author=Cavan Sieczkowski |quote=Playboy: Jack Gould, former television critic of The New York Times, called you "quite possibly the most intuitively funny woman alive."

===1950s–1960s===
During the late 1950s, Rivers appeared in a short-run play, ''Driftwood'', playing a [[lesbian]] with a crush on a character played by a then-unknown [[Barbra Streisand]]. The play ran for six weeks.<ref>''Enter Talking'', pp. 85–96 and last photo insert page before p. 183.</ref> Rivers performed in numerous comedy clubs in the [[Greenwich Village]] area of New York City in the early 1960s, including [[The Bitter End]] and [[The Gaslight Cafe]],<ref>''Enter Talking'', p. 230.</ref> before making her first appearances as a guest on the TV program ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' originating from [[New York]], hosted at the time by [[Jack Paar]].<ref>''Enter Talking'', pp. 233–239.</ref>

By 1965, Rivers had a stint on ''[[Candid Camera]]'' as a gag writer and participant; she was "the bait" to lure people into ridiculous situations for the show. She also made her first appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' with new host [[Johnny Carson]], on February 17, 1965.<ref>''Enter Talking'', pp. 359–373.</ref> During the same decade, Rivers made other appearances on ''The Tonight Show'' as well as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', while hosting the first of several talk shows. She wrote material for the puppet [[Topo Gigio]]. She had a brief role in ''[[The Swimmer (1968 film)|The Swimmer]]'' (1968), starring [[Burt Lancaster]]. A year later, she had a short-lived syndicated daytime talk show, ''That Show with Joan Rivers''; Johnny Carson was her first guest.<ref name=jr1969>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124948|title=The Joan Rivers Show|publisher=Imdb.com|accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> In the middle of the 1960s, she released at least two comedy albums, ''The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/joan_rivers/the_next_to_last_joan_rivers_album/ |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 5, 2014}}</ref> and ''Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis & Other Funny Stories''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joan Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis & Other Funny Stories |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/joan-rivers-presents-mr-phyllis-and-other-funny-stories-mw0002076502 |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

===1970s===
By the 1970s, Rivers was appearing on various television comedy and variety shows, including ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' and a semi-regular stint on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. From 1972 to 1976, she narrated ''[[The Adventures of Letterman]]'', an animated segment for ''[[The Electric Company]]''. In 1973, Rivers wrote the TV movie ''[[The Girl Most Likely to...]]'', a black comedy starring [[Stockard Channing]]. In 1978, Rivers wrote and directed the film ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]'', starring her friend [[Billy Crystal]]. During the same decade, she was the opening act for singers [[Helen Reddy]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Mac Davis]] and [[Sergio Franchi]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Joan Rivers dies at age 81|url=http://www.mamamia.com.au/news/joan-rivers-dead/|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=5 September 2014}}</ref>

===1980s–1990s===
Rivers spoke of her primary ''Tonight Show'' life as having been "Johnny Carson's daughter", a reference to his longtime mentoring of her and, during the 1980s, establishing her as his regular guest host by August 1983. She also hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', on April 9, 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0695000/ |title=Saturday Night Live |publisher=Imdb.com |date=April 9, 1983 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> In the same period, she released a best-selling comedy album on [[Geffen Records]], ''What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?'' The album reached No. 22 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]].<ref name=metrolyrics>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1984-grammy-awards.html |title=Grammy Awards |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |date=February 28, 1984 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref>

During the 1980s, she continued doing stand-up shows along with appearing on various television shows. In February 1983, she performed at [[Carnegie Hall]]<ref>[http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19830209-01.2.12&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-Teichner----- "Joan Rivers at Carnegie Hall"], ''Columbia Spectator'', February 9, 1983.</ref> and the following year, she did stand-up on the United Kingdom's TV show ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience With Joan Rivers]]''.<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_9N_z6Wmkc "AN AUDIENCE WITH JOAN RIVERS (1983)"]</ref>

A friend of [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] and President [[Ronald Reagan]], Rivers attended a [[state dinner]] in 1983, and later, at the invitation of Nancy, spoke at luncheon at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lavender |first=Paige |date=4 September 2014 |title=Joan Rivers Said Nancy Reagan Helped Her After Her Husband's Suicide |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/04/joan-rivers-nancy-reagan_n_5768458.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}<br/>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |agency=Washington Post |title=Nancy Reagan didn't mine Joan Rivers' off-color jokes |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QKxQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=heEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5090%2C6067634 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |date=24 August 1984 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}<br/>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Joan Rivers Explains in 2012 E!

In 1984, Rivers published a best-selling humor book, ''The Life and Hard Times of Heidi Abramowitz'', a mock memoir of her brassy, loose comedy character. A television special based on the character, a mock tribute called ''Joan Rivers and Friends Salute Heidi Abramowitz,'' was not successful with the public.

The decade was controversial for Rivers. She sued [[Drag queen|female impersonator]] [[Frank Marino (female impersonator)|Frank Marino]] for $5,000,000 in 1986, after discovering he was using her real stand-up material in the impersonation of her that he included in his popular Las Vegas act. The two comics reconciled and even appeared together on television in later years.<ref>[http://www.frankmarino.com/txform.html Frank Marino discusses lawsuit]</ref>

In 1986 came the move that ended Rivers' longtime friendship with Johnny Carson, who had first hired her as a ''Tonight Show'' writer. The soon-to-launch [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television Network]] announced that it was giving her a late night talk show, ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers]]'', making Rivers the first woman to have her own late night talk show on a major network.<ref>''Comic Genius: Portraits of Funny People'', Chronicle Books (2013) p. 197.</ref><ref name=King>King, Norman (1993). ''Arsenio Hall''. New York: William Morrow & Co., pp. 47–48.</ref>

The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary, ''Johnny Carson: King of Late Night,'' Rivers said she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning he may have already heard about it and that he immediately hung up on her. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from appearing on the ''Tonight Show,'' a decision respected by Carson's first two successors [[Jay Leno]] and [[Conan O'Brien]]. After the release of his 2013 biography on Johnny Carson, Carson's manager Harry Bushkin revealed that he never received a call from Rivers' husband Edgar concerning the move to Fox, contrary to what Edgar had told Rivers.<ref>{{cite news|title=BOOKS, FISHBOWLLA: Heeeere's Henry!

Shortly after Carson's death in 2005, Rivers said that he had never spoken to her again. In 2008, during an interview with Dr. [[Pamela Stephenson|Pamela Connolly]] on television's ''[[Shrink Rap (TV series)|Shrink Rap]]'', Rivers claimed she did call Carson, but he hung up on her at once and repeated the gesture when she called again.

''The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers'' turned out to be flecked by tragedy. When Rivers challenged FOX executives, who wanted to fire her husband [[Edgar Rosenberg]] as the show's producer, the network fired them both. On May 15, 1987, three months later, Rosenberg committed suicide in Philadelphia; Rivers blamed the tragedy on his "humiliation" by Fox.<ref>Joanne Kaufman, Alan Carter, [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116863,00.html] "Rocked by Tragedy and Failure, Joan Rivers Comes Back with a New Show and a New Life", ''People'', February 19, 1990.</ref> Rivers credited Nancy Reagan with helping her after the 1987 suicide of her second husband.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Judy |date=4 September 2014 |title=Gillibrand, Nancy Reagan mourn Joan Rivers's death |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/216712-gillibrand-mourns-death-of-joan-rivers |newspaper=The Hill |accessdate=19 October 2014 |quote=Rivers credited the former president's wife with helping her after the 1987 suicide of her second husband, Edgar Rosenberg. The comedy queen recalled the conversation with Reagan in a 2010 interview, "I said, 'I can't get Edgar's body out of Philadelphia.' She said, 'Let me see what I can do.' The next day, his body came back to L.A. You don't ever forget that, especially when the chips are down." }}</ref> Fox attempted to continue the show with a new name (''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'') and rotating guest hosts.

Rivers subsequently appeared on various TV shows, including ''[[The David Letterman Show]]''<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eERXsOmqC4#t=161 "David Letterman Remembers Joan Rivers"]</ref> and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' Christmas Special. By 1989, she tried another daytime TV talk show, ''[[The Joan Rivers Show]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262164/ |title=The Joan Rivers Show|publisher=Imdb.com |date=May 25, 2001 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> which ran for five years and won her a [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]] in 1990 for Outstanding Talk Show Host.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=331}}</ref> In 1994, Rivers and daughter [[Melissa Rivers|Melissa]] first hosted the [[E!|E!

Rivers also appeared as one of the center square occupants on the 1986–89 version of ''The [[Hollywood Squares]]'', hosted by [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]].

In 1994, influenced by the stand-up comedy of [[Lenny Bruce]], Rivers co-wrote and starred in a play about Bruce's mother [[Sally Marr]], who was also a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]] and influenced her son's development as a comic.

Joan and her daughter premiered the new show ''[[Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?]]'' on [[WE tv]]. The series follows Joan moving to California to be closer to her family. She moves in with daughter Melissa while searching for a home of her own. WE tv then ordered a new season consisting of 10 episodes, which premiered in January 2012. In 2011, Rivers was featured as herself in Season 2 of [[Louis C.K.]]'s self-titled show ''[[Louie (TV series)|Louie]]'', where she performed on-stage. Beginning September 10, 2010, Rivers co-hosted the [[E!]] show ''[[Fashion Police]]'', along with [[Giuliana Rancic]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], and [[George Kotsiopoulos]] commenting on the dos and don'ts of celebrity fashion.

===Comedic style===
During her 55-year career as a comedian, her tough-talking style of satirical humor was both praised and criticized as truthful, yet too personal, too gossipy, and very often abrasive. Nonetheless, with her ability to "tell it like it is," she became a pioneer of contemporary stand-up comedy. Commenting about her style, she told biographer Gerald Nachman, "Maybe I started it. We're a very gossipy culture. All we want to know now is private lives."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|619}}

However, her style of humor, which often relied on making jokes about her own life and [[Satire|satirizing]] the lives of celebrities and public figures, was sometimes criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Adele]]'s weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joan-rivers-calls-adele-chubby-says-the-singer-should-lose-weight-2013313|title=Joan Rivers Calls Adele 'Chubby', Says the Singer Should 'Lose Weight'|work=[[Us Weekly]]|first=Zach|last=Johnson|date=March 31, 2013|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/joan-rivers-sticks-fat-adele-comments-article-1.1304702|title= Joan Rivers sticks to 'fat' Adele comments after singer demands apology: 'She should just calm down — or lose weight!'|work=New York Daily News}}</ref> Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about [[the Holocaust]] and later explained, "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1712229.php/Leave-Joan-Rivers-alone-Holocaust-remark-part-of-her-lifelong-comedic-style-VIDEO |title=Leave Joan Rivers alone!

Rivers accepted such criticism as part of her using social [[satire]] as a form of humor: "I've learned to have absolutely no regrets about any jokes I've ever done&nbsp;... You can tune me out, you can click me off, it's OK. I am not going to bow to [[political correctness]]. But you do have to learn, if you want to be a satirist, you can't be part of the party."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/joan-rivers-best-jokes-one-565826|title=Joan Rivers Interview: Her 6 best one-liners|work=Hollywood Reporter|date=June 12, 2013}}</ref>

Rivers states that seeing [[Lenny Bruce]] perform at a local club while she was in college influenced her developing style:

{{quote|He was an epiphany. Lenny told the truth. It was a total affirmation for me that I was on the right track long before anyone said it to me. He supplied the revelation that personal truth can be the foundation of comedy, that outrageousness can be cleansing and healthy. It went off inside me like an enormous flash.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|608}}}}

[[File:Joan Rivers - Life in Progress - Fringe.jpg|thumb|left|Rivers performing in her show at the 2008 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]]]

As an unknown stand-up comedian out of college, she struggled for many years before finding her comic style. She did stints in the [[Catskills]] and found that she disliked the older style of comedy at the time, such as [[Phyllis Diller]]'s, whom she felt was a pioneer female comedian.<ref name=Greenspoon>Leonard Jay Greenspoon, ed. ''Jews and Humor'', Purdue University Press (2011) p. 163</ref> Her breakthrough came at [[The Second City]] in [[Chicago]] in 1961, where she was dubbed "the best girl since [[Elaine May]]," who also got her start there. But May became her and fellow comedian [[Treva Silverman]]'s role model, as Rivers saw her as "an assertive woman with a marvelous, fast mind and, at the same time, pretty and feminine."<ref name=Greenspoon/> It was also there that she learned "self reliance," she said, "that I didn't have to talk down in my humor" and could still earn an income by making intelligent people laugh. "I was really born as a comedian at Second City. I owe it my career."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp|607}}

In early 1965, at the suggestion of comedian [[Bill Cosby]], Johnny Carson gave Rivers, whom he billed as a comedy writer, her debut appearance on his show.<ref name=Zoglin>Zoglin, Richard. ''Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America'', Bloomsbury Publishing (2008) e-book</ref><ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUKI-_TXuUY Joan Rivers on Johnny Carson Show]</ref> Cosby, who knew Rivers from their early stand-up days, described her as "an intelligent girl without being a weirdo ... a human being, not a kook."<ref name=Nachman>Nachman, Gerald. ''Seriously Funny'', Pantheon (2003).</ref>{{rp|596}} Sitting alongside Johnny after her monologue, she displayed an intimate, conversational style which he appreciated, and she was invited back eight more times that year.<ref name=Zoglin/>

''Time'' magazine compared her humor to that of [[Woody Allen]], by expressing "how to be neurotic about practically everything," but noting that "her style and femininity make her something special." Rivers also compared herself to Allen, stating: "He was a writer, which I basically was ... and talking about things that affected our generation that nobody else talked about."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|596}} ''The New York Times'' critic [[Charles L. Mee]] likewise compared her to Allen, explaining that her "style was personal, an autobiographical stream-of-consciousness."<ref name=Zoglin />

Rivers' image contrasted starkly with Carson's stage demeanor, which was one of the reasons he made her co-host according to critic [[Michael Pollan]], who compared their style of humor:
{{quote|Where Carson is scrupulously polite, Rivers is bitchy; where he is low-key, she is overheated; where he is Midwest, Waspy and proper, she is urban, ethnic and gossipy. Carson conducts interviews as if he were at the country club; Rivers does hers at the kitchen table.<ref>Timberg, Bernard. ''Television Talk: A History of the TV Talk Show'', University of Texas Press (2002) p. 132.</ref>}}

In her personal life, she had fewer of those neurotic or intense character traits, according to Ralph Schoenstein, who dated her and worked with her on her humor books. He said, "She has no airs. She doesn't stand on ceremony. The woman has absolutely no pretense. She'll tell you everything immediately. Joan isn't cool—she's completely open. It's all grist. It's her old thing—'Can we talk?'"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|623}}

According to biographer Victoria Price, Rivers' humor was notable for taking aim at and overturning what had been considered acceptable female behavior. By her bravura she broke through long-standing taboos in humor, which paved the way for other women, including [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]].<ref name=Price>Price, Victoria, ed. ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', vol. 4, St. James Press (2000) pp. 219–220.</ref>
