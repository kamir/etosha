'''Martin Fitzgerald Lawrence'''<ref name="actors">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''</ref> (born April 16, 1965) is an [[United States|American]] comedian, actor, and filmmaker. He came to fame during the 1990s, establishing a Hollywood career as a leading actor, most notably in the films ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'', ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', ''[[Nothing to Lose (1997 film)|Nothing to Lose]]'', ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]'', ''[[Big Momma's House]]'', and ''[[A Thin Line Between Love & Hate]]''.

==Early life==
Lawrence, the fourth of six children, was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] on April 16, 1965 to [[African American]] parents. He was named after civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="actors"/> His father, John Lawrence, was serving in the U.S. military in Germany at the time of Martin's birth.<ref name="actors"/> After his parents divorced when he was eight years old,<ref>{{cite web | title=Martin Lawrence Biography&nbsp;– Yahoo!

==Career==
Lawrence ended up moving to New York City and found his way to the legendary ''[[The Improv]]''. Shortly after appearing at The Improv, Lawrence won a performance spot on ''[[Star Search]]''.<ref name="actors"/> He did well on the show and made it to the final round, but didn't win. However, executives at [[Columbia Pictures Television]] saw Martin's performance and offered him the role of "Maurice" on the television sitcom ''[[What's Happening Now!!]]''; this was his first acting job.<ref name="actors"/> Upon cancellation of that show, Lawrence found bit parts in various films and television series.  His breakthrough role was as Cee in the Spike Lee film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''. Other roles followed in films such as the ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'' series, ''[[Talkin' Dirty After Dark]]'', and the [[Eddie Murphy]] vehicle ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''.  During this period, entertainment mogul [[Russell Simmons]] selected him to host the groundbreaking series ''[[Def Comedy Jam]]'' on HBO. ''Def Comedy Jam'' gave many comedians (including [[Chris Tucker]], [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Mike Epps]], [[Bernie Mac]] and [[Cedric the Entertainer]]) mainstream exposure.

During his stint with ''Def Comedy Jam'', Lawrence appeared in his own hit series, ''[[Martin (television)|Martin]]'', which aired on Fox TV.<ref name="actors"/> The show ran from 1992 to 1997 and was an enormous success. ''Martin'' was the flagship of Fox's Thursday-night line-up, which drew millions of viewers away from NBC's "Must See TV" line-up. He hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on February 19, 1994, where he made crude remarks about women's genitalia and personal hygiene; the monologue was completely edited out of NBC reruns and [[Television syndication|syndicated]] versions, and Lawrence was banned from the show for life. ''Martin'''s ratings continued to skyrocket so much that Fox became more of a contender against NBC and came closer to being considered among the top television networks.

After ''Martin'' ended its run in 1997, Lawrence found ample work in comedy films. He often starred as the second lead opposite actors including [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Danny DeVito]], and [[Tim Robbins]].<ref name="actors"/> Many of his films were blockbusters at the box office, including ''[[Nothing to Lose (1997 film)|Nothing to Lose]]'', ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]'', ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]'', and ''[[Big Momma's House]]''. He also starred in critical- and box-office failures, including ''[[Black Knight (film)|Black Knight]]'' and ''[[National Security (film)|National Security]]''. Regardless, his salary steadily increased to over $10 million per film role. He continues to work in film, with such films as ''[[Big Momma's House 2]]'', which opened at No. 1 at North American box office and grossed almost $28 million its first weekend,<ref>{{cite web | title=Yahoo! Movies&nbsp;– Weekend Box Office and Buzz | publisher=Yahoo! Movies | url=http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/boxoffice/;_ylt=AkYyUfLDqGajIFBbgC242klfVXcA | accessdate=March 26, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[Wild Hogs]]'' (2007), in which he played a bored suburbanite seeking adventure on the open road in a biker comedy alongside [[John Travolta]], [[Tim Allen]] and [[William H. Macy]].

In 2006, Lawrence appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', during which Lawrence briefly brought back to life some of the characters he'd portrayed on ''Martin''.

In 2008, Lawrence starred in Disney's ''[[College Road Trip]]'' co-starring with [[Raven-Symoné]]. It was his first G-rated film, but not his first appearance in a children's film: he supplied a voice for ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'' (2006) opposite [[Ashton Kutcher]].

At the 2009 [[BET Awards]] he appeared in a spoof movie trailer with [[Jamie Foxx]] for a fictional movie, ''The Skank Robbers'', that featured their respective television characters ''Sheneneh Jenkins'' and ''Ugly Wanda''. In 2010, Fox announced that it was producing a film based on the sketch, featuring Foxx, Lawrence, and actress [[Halle Berry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrio.com/entertainment/skank-robbers-jamie-foxx-martin-lawrence-reprise-drag-roles.php|publisher=Catch|title='Skank Robbers': Jamie Foxx, Martin Lawrence to reprise drag roles|date=October 11, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, Lawrence reprised his role as FBI agent Malcolm Turner in ''[[Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son]]'', the third film in the ''Big Momma's House'' series.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/nov/10/big-mommas-house-3-trailer|title=Big Momma's House 3: once, twice, three times a fake lady|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 10, 2010|last=Heritage|first=Stuart}}</ref>

In January 2013, it was announced that Lawrence and [[Kelsey Grammer]] are considering pairing up to star in a comedy for Lionsgate TV. The series will likely follow the same production model as [[Charlie Sheen]]'s ''[[Anger Management (TV series)|Anger Management]]'', which is also produced by Lionsgate TV. That show was recently given a hardy back-90 pickup following its initial 10-episode order.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/04/kelsey-grammer-and-martin-lawrence-teaming-up|title=Kelsey Grammer and Martin Lawrence Teaming Up?|publisher=Terence?date=January 4, 2013}}</ref> In March 2013, it was announced that television producers/writers [[Robert L.

===Legal and health problems===

In July 1995, while on the set filming ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'', Lawrence lashed out in a violent rage and was then hospitalized at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20122118,00.html|title=Disorderly Conduct|last=Lang|first=Steven|date=May 12, 1997|publisher=''People''|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>

On May 8, 1996, he became increasingly erratic and was arrested after he brandished a [[pistol]] in the middle of an intersection on [[Ventura Boulevard]] in Los Angeles, screaming, "They're trying to kill me!"  He was again hospitalized, with his public-relations agent citing exhaustion and dehydration as the reasons for this episode.<ref name="actors"/>
