==Pastoral career==
[[File:Mike Huckabee at Thomas Road Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|left|Huckabee at [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]], 2008]]

At age 21, Huckabee was a staffer for [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]].<ref name="scottparks"/>  Robison commented, "His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes."<ref name="scottparks"/> Prior to his political career, he served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] from 1980 to 1986, and the Beech Street Baptist Church in [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]] from 1986 to 1992. He started 24-hour television stations in both cities, where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called ''Positive Alternatives''.<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s.<ref name="scottparks"/><ref name="Isikoff"/>

In 1989 Huckabee ran against [[Ronnie Floyd]] of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.<ref>Robert Marus for the Associated Baptist Press.

==Political career==

===Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, 1993-1996===

In Huckabee's first political race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Senator and [[conservative Democrat]] [[Dale Bumpers]], receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE163FF936A35752C1A964958260|title=THE 1992 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE; SOUTH|date=November 5, 1992|publisher=The New York Times | first1=James | last1=Bennet | first2=John H. | last2=Cushman Jr | first3=James | last3=Dao | first4=Jason | last4=DeParle | first5=Clifford | last5=Krauss | first6=Stephen | last6=Labaton | first7=Neil A. | last7=Lewis | first8=David | last8=Margolick | first9=Maria | last9=Newman | first10=Martin | last10=Tolchin | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> In the same election, Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]] became [[President of the United States|president]], making Lieutenant Governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] the new Governor. In 1993, Republican state chairman [[Asa Hutchinson]] urged Huckabee to run in the [[special election]] for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers' campaign manager the previous year,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |title=GOP wins one in Arkansas – Republican Party; Mike Huckabee &#124; Campaigns & Elections &#124; Find Articles at BNET.com<!--Bot-generated title--> |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107151043/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |archivedate = January 7, 2008}}</ref> 51–49 percent.<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> Huckabee became only the second Republican since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been [[Maurice Britt]] from 1967 to 1971.

In his autobiography ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: "The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier."<ref>Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', pp. 6–7</ref>

[[Dick Morris]], who had previously worked for [[Bill Clinton]], advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994 and 1998.<ref name = "RexNelson">{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Rex|date=July 2, 1995|title=Clinton's Hired Gun Gives Huckabee Hand: Lieutenant Governor Shooting for Senate|publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette}}</ref> Huckabee commented that Morris was a "personal friend."<ref name = "RexNelson"/> A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: "Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'"<ref name = "RexNelson"/>

Morris elaborated, "So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans."<ref name = "RexNelson"/> Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and left-wing organizations such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, "I will not participate in any program that has [[racism|racist]] overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and [[anti-Semitism]]."<ref>{{cite news |last=Duhart |first=Bill |title=Huckabee Won't Appear With Racist |publisher=Philadelphia Tribune |date=April 12, 1994 |url=http://www.ferris.edu/isar/institut/CCC/philly.htm |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 1994, Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3929|title=1994 AR Lt.

In October 1995, [[David Pryor]] announced that he was retiring from the [[United States Senate]]. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved ahead in the polls,<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> but ultimately dropped out of the race to lead the state after incumbent governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] resigned following his fraud and conspiracy convictions.<ref name="KevinSack" />

===Governor of Arkansas, 1996-2007===
{{Main|Governorship of Mike Huckabee}}

In 1996, incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] was convicted of fraud. The [[Arkansas Constitution]], like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office, so Tucker was forced to resign. However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal,<ref name="Barone 44">{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |page=44}}</ref> rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee threatened to initiate [[impeachment]] proceedings against Tucker.<ref name="scottparks"/> Huckabee was sworn in as [[Governor of Arkansas]] on July 15, 1996.

In November 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired Colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state's third elected Republican Governor since Reconstruction.

In November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer [[Jimmie Lou Fisher]], garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican [[U.S. Senator]] [[Tim Hutchinson]]. By the end of his term, Huckabee held the third-longest tenure of any Arkansas Governor. Only Democrats [[Orval Faubus]], who served six consecutive two-year terms (1955–1967), and [[Bill Clinton]], who served 11 years, 11 months (1979–1981; 1983–1992), had longer tenures.

Huckabee said that his experience as a minister afforded him special insight in being governor: <blockquote>My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week. I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband; I saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home, give up their independence, and move into a long-term-care facility; I listened to countless young couples pour out their souls as they struggled to get their marriages into survival mode when confronted with overextended debt...<ref>Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', p. 7</ref></blockquote>

During his time as a governor Huckabee raised taxes 21 times for a net tax increase of $505 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/huckabee-in-tax-war-as-ex-governor-launches-white-house-bid-2015-05-05 |title= Huckabee in tax war as ex-governor launches White House bid |last1=Schroeder |first1=Robert |date=5 May 2015 |website=www.marketwatch.com |publisher=MarketWatch, Inc. |accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref>

Huckabee's handling of clemency petitions received national attention in November 2009 with the case of [[Maurice Clemmons]], who had committed burglary without a weapon at age 16.

After parole in 2000, Clemmons was arrested for multiple offenses including [[child molestation]] and [[aggravated assault]], but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges. After Clemmons murdered four police officers in [[Lakewood, Washington]] a two-day manhunt ensued, and Clemmons was shot and killed by a [[Seattle Police Department]] officer after refusing police orders to stop charging the officer.<ref name="SeaTimes01Dec">{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010393433_webarrest01m.html|title=Lakewood police shooting suspect killed by Seattle police officer in South Seattle early this morning|last=Sullivan|first=Jennifer|author2=Mark Rahner |author3=Jack Broom |date=December 1, 2009|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=December 1, 2009}}</ref> In his book about the shooting, ''The Other Side of Mercy,'' Jonathan Martin of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that Huckabee apparently failed to review Clemmons' prison file, which was "thick with acts of violence and absent indications of rehabilitation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/opinionnw/2013/12/18/mike-huckabees-maurice-clemmons-problem/|title=Mike Huckabee’s Maurice Clemmons problem|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=2013-12-18}}</ref>  Huckabee defended his actions, stating that the recommendation to reduce the sentence was unanimous and supported by the trial judge,  that the decision to parole him was made by the parole board, not him, and that Clemmons had been re-arrested and the decision not to file charges then had nothing to do with him.<ref>Huckabee, M.

In 2003, Eugene Fields received a six-year prison sentence after his fourth conviction of driving while intoxicated in five years. Gov. Huckabee granted clemency over the objections of the local prosecutor and sheriff, the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)|Mothers Against Drunk Driving]]. A spokeswoman for Mr. Huckabee, [[Charmaine Yoest]], said that Mr. Fields' political donations [to the Arkansas Republican Party] and connections played no role in his clemency.

We need to return to that six percent level."<ref name="foreignaffairs.org">{{cite web |date=2008 |last=Huckabee |first=Michael D. |title=America's Priorities in the War on Terror |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63059/michael-d-huckabee/americas-priorities-in-the-war-on-terror |website=[[Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=2015-01-06}}</ref>

'''Immigration'''

During his bid for president, Huckabee released a comprehensive nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan.

'''Gun control'''

Huckabee has voiced his support for [[self-defense]] and the [[Castle Doctrine]], and has generally taken an anti-[[gun control]] stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed.<ref name="issues"/> He has said that whenever he hears people start talking about hunting when referring to the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], he realizes they do not know what they are talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.<ref>[http://www.mikehuckabee.com/?FuseAction=Issues.View&Issue_id=18 Mike Huckabee for President - Issues<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Weight loss and health advocacy===
[[File:Paige, Huckabee, Rockefeller, and Hutchinson with large check, August 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Huckabee (second from left) in August 2002 before his weight loss]]
When elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was [[obesity|obese]]. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with [[type 2 diabetes]], and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135&nbsp;kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor [[Frank D. White]] (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50&nbsp;kg).<ref>

In ''God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,'' Huckabee discusses the myriad differences he's seen between those who live in the blue, coastal "bubbles" and the "bubbas" of the red flyover states.
