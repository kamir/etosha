His memoir is the basis for [[Jon Stewart|Jon Stewart's]] 2014 film ''[[Rosewater (film)|Rosewater]]''. In 2014 he produced and directed the documentary film ''[[To Light a Candle (film)|To Light a Candle]]'' about the persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran and the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education.

==Family and education==
Bahari was born in [[Tehran]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]], but moved to Canada in 1988 to study Film and Political Science. His family has been involved in dissident politics in Iran: his father was imprisoned by the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s regime in the 1950s, and his sister Maryam under the revolutionary government of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] in the 1980s. She later died of [[leukemia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Maziar Bahari |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/06/26/maziar-bahari-on-the-iranian-jailers-who-tortured-his-family.html |title=Maziar Bahari on the Iranian Jailers Who Tortured His Family - The Daily Beast |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>
He is married to Paola Gourley, an Italian-English lawyer working in London,<ref name="newsweek1">{{cite web|author=Christopher Dickey |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/03/waiting-for-maziar.html |title=Dickey: 100 Iranians on trial, one baby's future in the balance - The Daily Beast |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> who gave birth to their first child in October 2009 shortly after his release from prison.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bahari |first=Maziar |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/06/03/136862056/then-they-came-for-journalist-maziar-bahari |title='Then They Came For' Journalist Maziar Bahari |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>

==Career==
He graduated with a degree in communications from [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] in Montreal.   Soon after, Bahari made his first film, ''The Voyage of the [[MS St. Louis|Saint Louis]]'', about the attempt by 937 [[German Jewish]] refugees to escape Nazi Germany on that ship in 1939, who were turned away by [[Cuba]], the [[United States]], and Canada, and ultimately forced to return to the [[Third Reich]].  In producing the film, Bahari became the first Muslim to make a film about the Holocaust.  When asked what motivated him to make the film, he cited the courses he took at Concordia, where he: 
<blockquote>
studied the modern history of the Jews and I was fascinated by the history of the Jews in North America.  I took a course on Freud and religion and the professor talked a lot about early 20th century anti-Semitism in the U.S. and Canada.  I had no idea that even up until the 1950s Jews were discriminated against in North America, so I wanted to explore that further.  As an immigrant, I was interested in the history of Jewish immigration from Europe to America.  So I looked for a story to combine all these elements and came across the story of the St. Louis.</blockquote>

Later, while he was imprisoned in Iran the film "haunted" him, with his interrogators accusing him of being on a mission to work for [[Zionists]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nadine Epstein|url=http://www.momentmag.com/|title=118 Days in Iran's Evin Prison|date=July–August 2011|work=Moment Magazine|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref>

In 1997 Bahari began reporting in Iran and making independent documentaries, and in 1998 he became ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's Iran correspondent.<ref name="nytimes-nwk">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/media/04journalist.html |title=Newsweek Steps Up Effort to Free Reporter in Iran |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=2009-08-03 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref>

He has produced a number of other documentaries and news reports for [[Channel 4]], [[BBC]] and other broadcasters around the world on subjects as varied as private lives of [[Ayatollahs]], [[African architecture]], Iranians' passion for [[association football|football]] and contemporary history of [[Iran]]. In 2003, Harvard Film Archive praised Bahari's work:
<blockquote>
"In a country known for neorealist fiction films that focus on small events in the lives of individuals, the work of Iranian director Maziar Bahari is somewhat anomalous. Employing a traditional documentary style to explore more far-reaching cultural events, Bahari’s films provide a glimpse inside contemporary Iranian culture as they reveal the human element behind the headlines and capture cultural truths through the lens of individual experience. Representing a new generation of young Iranian filmmakers, Bahari’s trenchant looks at social issues in his country have brought both controversy and international acclaim."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2003mayjun/bahari.html |title=Maziar Bahari - Harvard Film Archive |publisher=Hcl.harvard.edu |date=2003-05-13 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref></blockquote>

Bahari's films have won several awards and nominations including an Emmy in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rorypecktrust.org/page/3047/Maziar+Bahari/26 |title=Previous Finalists |publisher=The Rory Peck Trust |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> A retrospective of Bahari's films was organized in November 2007 by the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/207315?from=rss|title=Global Writers and Filmmakers Call for Bahari's Release|date=2009-07-17|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> In September 2009, Bahari was nominated by [[Desmond Tutu]] for the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for Concord, widely known as Spain's [[Nobel Prize]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/opinion/09wed3.html |title=Free Maziar Bahari |date=2009-09-08 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref>

== Arrest, imprisonment, release ==
On the morning of June 21, 2009, during the [[2009 Iranian Election Protests]], Bahari was arrested at his family's home in Tehran and taken to [[Evin Prison]].<ref name="NEWSWEEK Reporter Arrested">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/06/20/newsweek-reporter-arrested.html |title=NEWSWEEK Reporter Arrested Without Charge in Iran - The Daily Beast |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2009-06-20 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> In July, while incarcerated, he appeared<ref name="cbs-bahari">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/mon-june-6-2011-maziar-baharitag=contentMain;contentBody|title=Newsweek's Bahari Recalls Iran Detention|author=Gravshon, Michael|author2=Magratten, Drew|date=2009-11-22|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|pages=2–3|accessdate=2009-12-01|archivedate=2009-12-01|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lgs9JfvF}}</ref>

His confession was dismissed by his family, his colleagues, and [[Reporters Without Borders]], saying that it must have come under duress.  Outside Iran, an international campaign to free him was headed by his wife and included petitions launched by [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], [[Index on Censorship]], [[International PEN]], and groups of documentary filmmakers.<ref name="newsweek1"/> ''[[Newsweek]]'' ran full-page advertisements in several major newspapers calling for his release.<ref name="nytimes-nwk" /> US Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] spoke publicly of his case.<ref name="ap-release"/><ref name="newsweek-release"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Dickey |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/219034 |title=Maziar Bahari's Ordeal in Tehran Prison - The Daily Beast |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>

On October 20, after 118 days<ref name="newsweek-ordeal" /> in jail and charged with 11 counts of espionage, Bahari was released on $300,000 bail. Bahari says he was asked to promise to spy on dozens of "anti-revolutionary elements" inside and outside Iran for the Revolutionary Guard and report to them weekly (a promise he had no intention of keeping).<ref>Bahari, Maziar ''Then They Came for Me, A Family's Story of Love, Captivity and Survival,'' [[Random House]], 2011, p.275-6</ref> He was allowed to leave the country and return to London days before the birth of his daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/19/60minutes/main5712199_page4.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title=Newsweek's Bahari Recalls Iran Detention |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>

==Post-imprisonment==
After his release Bahari recounted his time in prison in interviews and writings. He appeared on a segment of the television news program ''[[60 Minutes]]''<ref name=cbsnews>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5727424n&tag=contentMain;cbsCarousel |title=Preview: Witness - 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> and was the subject of an article in ''Newsweek''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Maziar Bahari |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/11/21/118-days-12-hours-54-minutes.html |title=Newsweek Reporter's Ordeal in Iran - The Daily Beast |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=2009-11-21 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> Bahari stated he confessed for television after physical and psychological torture. He was held in solitary confinement, interrogated daily (either blindfolded or made to face away from his interrogator),<ref name="newsweek-ordeal">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/219034|title=‘Everyone Has Forgotten You’|last=Dickey |first=Christopher |date=2009-10-22|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> threatened with execution, and repeatedly slapped, kicked, punched, and hit with a belt by his interrogator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/19/60minutes/main5712199_page3.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title=Newsweek's Bahari Recalls Iran Detention |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>  Bahari's interrogator told him they knew he (Bahari) "was working for four different intelligence agencies: the [[CIA]], [[Mossad]], [[MI6]] and ''Newsweek''." Bahari believes it was desperation to find "any evidence to prove I was a spy" that led his captors to believe his providing an American TV personality  with a list of Iranians they could talk to in Iran, was evidence of his being a spy. (Bahari provided such a list shortly before he was interviewed by [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]]<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127833007&ft=1&f=13|title=A Year Later, Journalist Reflects On Iranian Unrest|date=2010-06-15|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref>  a "correspondent" of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', who dressed up as a spy as a joke for the story.)<ref name="newsweek-118"/> He believes he was targeted to intimidate other international Iranian-born journalists, who unlike foreign journalists can operate free of regime minders, blend in with crowds, and understand the cultural and linguistic nuances of the moves the regime makes.<ref name=NPR/>

In interviews Bahari stated that his interrogator told him not to talk about what happened to him in prison, as the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Revolutionary Guards]] have "people all around the world and they can always bring me back to Iran in a bag". Bahari has stated that he will not be able to safely return to Iran until the [[Islamic Republic]] falls.<ref name=cbsnews/> In Iran he was tried in absentia by a [[Islamic Revolutionary Court|revolutionary court]], and sentenced to thirteen and a half years' imprisonment plus 74 lashes.<ref>Bahari, Maziar ''Then They Came for Me, A Family's Story of Love, Captivity and Survival'' [[Random House]], 2011, p.310</ref>

=== Campaign for other jailed journalists in Iran ===
Upon his release Bahari launched a campaign in support of other jailed journalists in Iran. The name of the campaign,<ref>{{cite web|author=CPJ Impact |url=http://www.cpj.org/2010/04/cpj-impact-15.php |title=CPJ Impact – Committee to Protect Journalists |publisher=Cpj.org |date=2010-04-18 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> Our Future Society will be a Free Society, was inspired by a quote from the leader of the Iranian revolution, [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In an ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' op-ed to launch the campaign Bahari wrote to Iran's [[Supreme Leader]], [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]],
<blockquote>"You may feel safe in your modest house, protected by thousands of revolutionary guards. But beyond them the world is changing. Iran is changing. In 1978, as the shah was doing his best to stifle his people, Ayatollah Khomeini promised that 'in an Islamic Iran the media will have the freedom to express all Iran’s realities and events.' Hoping they could realize that promise, Iranians rose up and overthrew the shah. Ayatollah Khamenei, those who forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/opinion/10iht-edbahari.html |work=The New York Times |first=Maziar |last=Bahari |title=Let My Colleagues Go |date=2010-02-10}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Press TV vs Maziar Bahari ===
After his release Bahari launched a complaint against Iranian government's English satellite channel, [[Press TV]], for filming and airing an interview with him under duress. In May 2011, [[Ofcom]] upheld Bahari's three complaints against [[Press TV]]. In the summary [[Ofcom]] said [[Press TV]]'s presentation of Bahari was unfair because it "omitted material facts and was placed in a context in which inferences adverse to Mr Bahari could be drawn". The media regulator also said that Press TV failed to get his consent and this "contributed to the overall unfairness to Mr Bahari in the item broadcast". [[Ofcom]] added that filming and broadcasting the interview without consent "while he was in a sensitive situation and vulnerable state was an unwarranted infringement of Mr Bahari's privacy".<ref name=pressTV>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/may/23/iran-press-tv-maziar-bahari|title=Iran's Press TV censured for interview with arrested journalist|date=23 May 2011|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2011-07-09|location=London|first=Mark|last=Sweney}}</ref>

Upon the release of Ofcom's findings, [[Press TV]] launched a campaign against Bahari and Ofcom. Bahari was accused of being "an [[MI6]] contact person".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/181242.html |title=PressTV - A British game against PressTV |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> [[Press TV]] called [[Ofcom]]'s ruling "part of an anti-Iranian campaign," and noted "A quick look at senior decision makers at Ofcom demonstrates that the regulator is mostly made up of former [[Channel 4]] and [[BBC]] executives, some of whom are well-linked to and influenced by powerful pro-[[Israel]]i politicians."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/187554.html |title=PressTV - OfCom, UK Office of Miscommunication |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/184355.html |title=PressTV - The OFCOM sitcom |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> Press TV's failure to pay a £100,000 fine for showing Bahari's 'confession' was connected with the revocation of Press TV's licence to broadcast in the UK, via satellite, in January 2012.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16652356 "Iran's Press TV loses UK licence"], BBC News, 20 January 2012</ref>

==Criticism==
In September 2008, the transcript of an interview conducted by Maziar Bahari of Akbar Etemad, the former head of Iran's nuclear program during the Shah's regime, was published in the ''New Statesman'' entitled "The Shah's Plan was to Build a Bomb."<ref>{{cite web|author=About Maziar Bahari |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/iran-nuclear-shah-west |title='&#39;The shah's plan was to build bombs'&#39; |work=New Statesman |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}</ref> In this piece, Maziar Bahari wrote that Etemad had confided in him that the Shah intended to make nuclear weapons with Iran's civilian nuclear program, the implication being that the Islamic government would do the same.

After the interview was published, Mr. Etemad wrote a letter to the New Statesman which appeared in the print edition of the Dec 1, 2008 issue of the magazine, in which he vociferiously denied the claim attributed to him by Maziar Bahari:

<blockquote>I told Mr Bahari that I had to know what the shah had in mind regarding the nature of the nuclear programme. I also said that during a long discussion, the shah told me that Iran did not need nuclear weapons, because our strong conventional forces would guarantee our security and national interests."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranaffairs.com/iran_affairs/2009/01/akbar-etemads-letter-on-his-interview-with-maziar-bahari.html |title=Akbar Etemad's letter on his interview with Maziar Bahari |publisher=Iran Affairs |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}</ref></blockquote>
