'''Goldie Jeanne Hawn''' (born November 21, 1945) is an American actress, film director, producer, and occasional singer. Hawn is known for her roles in television's ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' and films such as ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'', ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'', ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'', ''[[Overboard (film)|Overboard]]'', ''[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]'', ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'', ''[[The First Wives Club]]'', and ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', for which she won the 1969 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. She is the mother of actors [[Oliver Hudson]], [[Kate Hudson]], and [[Wyatt Russell]]. Hawn has had a relationship with actor [[Kurt Russell]] since 1983.

==Early life==
Hawn was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the daughter of Laura (née Steinhoff; November 27, 1913 – November 27, 1993), a jewelry shop/dance school owner, and Edward Rutledge Hawn (September 28, 1908 – June 7, 1982), a band musician who played at major events in Washington. She was named after her mother's aunt.<ref name=actors>Stated in Hawn interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2008</ref> She has one sister, Patricia; her brother, Edward, died as an infant before Goldie's birth.

Her father was Presbyterian and her mother was Jewish,<ref name=BBCinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cvpz1 |title=Woman's Hour (interview of Hawn)|work=BBC Radio|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012}} Minute 10:17 ''Q.

Since Edward Rutledge was born in Charleston, South Carolina on 23 Nov. 1749, it is not possible for Joseph to be a descendant of Edward's. It may still be possible for Goldie and Edward to be cousins, though it looks like the connection would have to be at least three more generations back.}}</ref> Hawn was raised in [[Takoma Park, Maryland]], a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended [[Montgomery Blair High School]] in nearby [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].

Hawn began taking ballet and tap dance lessons at the age of three, and danced in the chorus of the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' in 1955. She made her stage debut in 1961, playing Juliet in a Virginia Shakespeare Festival production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. By 1964, she ran and taught in a ballet school, having dropped out of [[American University]], where she was majoring in drama. In 1964, Hawn made her professional dancing debut in a production of ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' at the Texas Pavilion of the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. She began working as a professional dancer a year later, and appeared as a go-go dancer in New York City.<ref name=actors/>

==Career==
[[File:Goldie Hawn - 1970.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo for ''Cactus Flower'' (1969)]]

===1960s===
Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived situation comedy ''[[Good Morning, World]]'' during the 1967-1968 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical "[[dumb blonde]]" personality.<ref name=actors/>

Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]''. On the show, she would often break out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, and deliver a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her [[bikini]] and painted body, Hawn was seen as something of a 1960s [[It girl|"It" girl]].

Her ''Laugh-In'' persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'', and ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]''. Hawn had made her feature film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film ''[[The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band]]'', in which she was billed as "Goldie Jeanne", but in her first major film role, in ''Cactus Flower'' (1969), she won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] as [[Walter Matthau]]'s suicidal fiancée.

===1970s===
[[File:Goldie Hawn Carl Reiner Laugh In 1970.JPG|thumb|left|uprignt|With [[Carl Reiner]] on ''Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In'', 1970.]]
After Hawn's Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of above average and successful comedies starting with ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'' (1970), ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' (1971), and ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas ''[[The Girl from Petrovka]]'' and ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: ''Pure Goldie'' in 1971 and ''The Goldie Hawn Special'' in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of ''[[The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox]]'', while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.

On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend [[George Burns]], teen matinee idol [[Shaun Cassidy]], popular television star [[John Ritter]] (during his days on ''[[Three's Company]]''), and even the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (with [[Chevy Chase]]), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn's film career. The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in a murder plot.

Hawn's next film, [[Mario Monicelli|Mario Monicelli's]] ''[[Lovers and Liars]]'' (1979), was a [[box office bomb]]. In 1972 Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for [[Warner Brothers]], titled ''Goldie''. It was recorded with the help of [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Buck Owens]]. [[AllMusic]] gives the album a favorable review, calling it a "sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record".<ref name="amg_record_review">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r574832/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Goldie: Review|last=Mason|first=Stewart|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=November 2, 2009}}</ref>

===1980s===
Hawn's popularity continued into the 1980s, starting with another primetime variety special alongside actress and singer [[Liza Minnelli]], ''Goldie and Liza Together'' (1980), which was nominated for four primetime Emmys. In the same year, Hawn took the lead role in ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'', a comedy she produced. ''Private Benjamin'', which also stars [[Eileen Brennan]] and [[Armand Assante]], garnered Hawn her second [[Academy Award]] nomination, this time for Best Actress.<ref name=actors/> Hawn's box office success continued with comedies like ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), ''[[Protocol (film)|Protocol]]'' (1984), and ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]'' (1986)&nbsp;— Hawn also served as executive producer on the latter two&nbsp;— and dramas like ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982) and ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'' (1984).

At the age of thirty-nine, Hawn posed for the cover of ''[[Playboy]]''{{'s}} January 1985 issue. Hawn posed in a giant martini glass wearing nothing but a white collar shirt, a loosened black tie, and a pair of red stilettos. Her last film of the 1980s was opposite partner [[Kurt Russell]] for the third time in the comedy ''[[Overboard (film)|Overboard]]'' (1987).

===1990s===
Hawn's career slowed down after leaving Hollywood in the late 1980s, but revived somewhat in 1990 with the action comedy ''[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]'', a critically panned but commercially successful picture that paired Hawn with [[Mel Gibson]].

Hawn had mixed success in the early 1990s, with the thriller ''[[Deceived]]'' (1991), the drama ''[[CrissCross]]'' and opposite [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'' (both 1992). Earlier that year, she starred in ''[[Housesitter (film)|Housesitter]]'', a screwball comedy with [[Steve Martin]], which was a commercial and critical success. Hawn was absent from the screen again for four years while caring for her mother who died of cancer in 1994.<ref name=actors/> Hawn made her entry back into film as producer of the satirical comedy ''[[Something to Talk About (film)|Something to Talk About]]'' starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Dennis Quaid]], as well as making her directorial debut in the television film ''Hope'' (1997) starring [[Christine Lahti]] and [[Jena Malone]].<ref name=actors/>
[[File:Goldie Hawn cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hawn in 1989]]
Hawn returned to the screen again in 1996 as the aging, alcoholic actress Elise Elliot in the financially and critically successful ''[[The First Wives Club]]'', opposite [[Bette Midler]] and [[Diane Keaton]], with whom she covered the [[Lesley Gore]] hit "[[You Don't Own Me]]" for the film's soundtrack. Hawn also performed a [[cover version]] of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' song, "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]", on [[George Martin]]'s 1998 album, ''[[In My Life (George Martin album)|In My Life]]''. She continued her tenure in the 1990s with Woody Allen's musical ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996) and reuniting with Steve Martin for the comedy ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1999 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'' (1999), a remake of the [[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|1970 Neil Simon hit]]. The film was critically panned and was not successful at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Out-Of-Towners (1999)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087047-outoftowners/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Out-of-Towners|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=out-of-towners.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref> In 1997, Hawn, along with her co-stars from ''The First Wives Club'', [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Bette Midler]], were recipients of the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#Crystal award|Women in Film Crystal Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wif.org/past-recipients|title=Past Recipients|publisher=wif.org|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 2001 Hawn was reunited with former co-stars [[Warren Beatty]] (her co-star in ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'') and [[Diane Keaton]] for the comedy, ''[[Town & Country (film)|Town & Country]]'', a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90&nbsp;million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only $7&nbsp;million in its North American theatrical run. In 2002, she appeared in ''[[The Banger Sisters]]'' opposite [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]].

In 2005 Hawn's autobiography, ''[[A Lotus Grows in the Mud]]'', was published.

==Personal life==

Hawn has studied meditation. In a 2012 interview, she stated, "I don't think of myself as a Buddhist. I was born Jewish, and I consider that my religion". She also stated, "It's not the idea of a particular religion that's important; it's the development of a spiritual life".<ref>[http://www.prevention.com/mind-body/emotional-health/goldie-hawn-happiness-and-meditation-tips?page=2 Goldie Hawn happiness and meditation tips], Prevention</ref>

[[File:Goldie Hawn 2011.jpg|thumb|Hawn at the Cinema Against AIDS in May 2011]]
Hawn is a supporter of the [[LGBT community]]. Speaking on nations such as Nigeria and others which have criminalized homosexuals, she denounced these laws, stating, "This is man's inhumanity to man, of the first order."<ref>[http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/archive/segment/goldie-hawn-acceptance-of-gay-rights-is-inevitable/52e38c6dfe34442f4d0003e1?cn=tbla]</ref>

===Relationships and family===
Hawn's first husband was dancer (later director) [[Gus Trikonis]], who appeared as a Shark in ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]''; his sister Gina played Graziella, Riff's girlfriend. Her second husband was [[Bill Hudson (singer)|Bill Hudson]], of the [[Hudson Brothers]]; the couple married in 1976 and divorced in 1980. They have two children, actor [[Oliver Hudson]] (born September 7, 1976) and actress [[Kate Hudson]] (born April 19, 1979).

Hawn has been in a relationship with actor [[Kurt Russell]] since 1983.
