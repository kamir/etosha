'''''Comedy Central's Indecision 2000''''' was a series of special episodes featured on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' spoofing the [[2000 Presidential Election]]. This series covered the primaries leading up to the general election between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]]. The series featured "correspondents" at the [[Democratic National Convention]] as well as the [[Republican National Convention]]. At the conventions, the correspondents interviewed many politicians in the comedic style that has made ''The Daily Show'' famous. On the first episode after election night, Jon Stewart said that the name was a joke and he had not expected people to take it seriously, referring to the debacle in [[Florida]].

This edition of Indecision also included a separate series called ''Lewis Black's World of Politics'', aired during the Republican and Democratic national conventions and featuring [[Lewis Black]]. It was included on Black's DVD releases ''Lewis Black - Unleashed'' in 2003.

In 2000, ''Indecision 2000'' won a [[Peabody Award]].<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2000 60th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2001.</ref>
