'''George Denis Patrick Carlin'''<ref name=james7/> (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American [[comedian]], [[social criticism|social critic]], [[actor]], and [[author]]. Carlin was noted for his [[black comedy]] and his thoughts on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. Carlin and his "[[Seven dirty words]]" comedy routine were central to the 1978 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the [[Radio waves|public airwaves]].

He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians: One newspaper called Carlin "the dean of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] comedians."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/people/index.ssf/2008/06/george_carlin_counterculture_c.html |title=George Carlin, counterculture comedians' dean, dies at 71 |first=Michael |last=Norman |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |date=June 23, 2008 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Carlin was placed second on the [[Comedy Central]] list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, ahead of [[Lenny Bruce]] and behind [[Richard Pryor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |title=Stand Up Comedy & Comedians |publisher=Comedy Zone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051123214352/http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |archivedate=2005-11-23 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> The first of his 14 stand-up comedy specials for [[HBO]] was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of [[American culture]]. He was a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' during the three-decade [[Johnny Carson]] era, and hosted the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. His final HBO special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].

== Early life ==
Carlin was born in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]].<ref>{{cite video|people=Carlin, George|title=[[Complaints and Grievances]]|medium=TV|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=November 17, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]|last=Carlin|first=George|chapter=The Old Man and the Sunbeam|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|date=November 10, 2009|location=New York|page=6|isbn=1-4391-7295-1|quote=Lying there in New York Hospital, my first definitive act on this planet was to vomit.}}</ref> He was the younger son of ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' advertising manager Patrick Carlin (1888–1945) an immigrant from County [[Donegal]], [[Ireland]] and secretary Mary Beary-Carlin (born c. 1905), who was an American of Irish ancestry. While he came from a [[Catholic]] family, Carlin rejected religion. His parents separated when he was 2 months old due to his father's alcoholism. Mary subsequently raised George and his older brother, Patrick Carlin, Jr. (born October 1, 1931), on her own.<ref name="james7">{{cite book |first=James |last=Sullivan |title=Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2010 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IWYmZd1T3HkC&dq=Seven+Dirty+Words:+The+Life+and+Crimes+of+George+Carlin&source=gbs_navlinks_s |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> His maternal grandfather, Dennis Bearey, was an Irish immigrant who worked as a New York City policeman.

Carlin joined the [[United States Air Force]] when he was old enough, and was trained as a [[radar]] technician. He was stationed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]. He also began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, Carlin was discharged early on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force he had been [[court-martial]]ed three times, and also received many nonjudicial punishments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://variety.com/2008/film/news/comedian-george-carlin-dies-at-71-1117987925/ |title=Comedian George Carlin dies at 71 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 22, 2008 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

== Career ==
In 1959, Carlin met [[Jack Burns]], a fellow DJ at radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html|title=Texas Radio Hall of Fame: George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040923044145/http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |archivedate=2004-09-23 |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> They formed a comedy team and after successful performances at Fort Worth's [[Beat Generation|beat]] coffeehouse called The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960.<ref name="james7"/>

Within weeks of arriving in California, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created ''The Wright Brothers'', a morning show on [[KDAY]] in Hollywood. During their tenure at KDAY, they honed their material in [[beatnik]] coffeehouses at night.<ref name=bio60s>{{Cite news |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |title=Timeline – 1960s |work=George Carlin Biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000621020616/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |archivedate=2000-06-21 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Years later when he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&entity_id=19830&source_type=A|title=Biographical information for George Carlin|publisher=Kennedy Center|date=|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}</ref> Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]'', in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.<ref name=bio60s /> After two years together as a team, they parted to pursue individual careers, but "remain[ed] the best of friends".<ref>Carlin, George (2009). Last Words. New York: Free Press, pp. 47-8. ISBN 1-4391-7295-1.</ref>

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, where he played various characters:<ref name=timeline />
* The Indian Sergeant&nbsp;— "There will be a rain dance tonight ... weather permitting ..."
* Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO radio...")&nbsp;— "The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
* Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie Weatherman&nbsp;— "Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued mostly dark tonight, changing to widely scattered light towards morning."

Variations on these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, ''[[Take Offs and Put Ons]]'', which was recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in [[Detroit, Michigan]].<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |title=George Carlin's official site (see Timeline) |publisher=Georgecarlin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091008001351/http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |archivedate=2009-10-08 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>
[[File:George Carlin 1969.JPG|thumb|right|George Carlin in 1969]]
During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', initially with [[Jack Paar]] as host, then with [[Johnny Carson]]. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in ''Away We Go'', a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later [[anti-establishment]] material.<ref>''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; June 23, 2008.</ref>

Carlin was present at [[Lenny Bruce]]'s arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Profanity|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|series=Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|serieslink=Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=August 12, 2004|season=2|number=10}}</ref>

In the late 1960s, Carlin was making about $250,000 annually.<ref name=Zoglin/> As a [[tax shelter]] he bought a private jet&nbsp;— a twin-engine [[IAI Westwind|Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander]].

Eventually, Carlin changed his routines and his appearance. Carlin hired talent managers — Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio — to help him reinvent his image, making him look more [[Hip (slang)|hip]] for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood and [[The Bitter End]] in New York City. Wald says that Carlin's income was thus reduced by 90%, but his later career arc was greatly improved.<ref name=Zoglin>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6xg1h5lBheQC&pg=PT34 |pages=34–35 |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=9781596919440 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> In 1970, record producer [[Monte Kay]] formed the [[Little David Records]] subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian [[Flip Wilson]] as co-owner.<ref>Sullivan 2010, p. 114.</ref> Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from RCA Records, and recorded a Carlin performance at [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[The Cellar Door]] in May 1971—this was released as ''[[FM & AM]]'' in January 1972. De Blasio was busy managing the fast-paced career of [[Freddie Prinze]], and was about to sign [[Richard Pryor]], so he released Carlin to Little David general manager Jack Lewis, who, like Carlin, was somewhat wild and rebellious.<ref>Sullivan 2010, p. 158.</ref> Carlin lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by [[Ed Sullivan]] in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter [[Kenny Rankin]] was Carlin's label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlin's musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlin's private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour, since Carlin had so much cocaine available.<ref name=Jet/>

The album ''[[FM & AM]]'' proved very popular. It marked Carlin's change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlin's previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlin's new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit". In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had utilized in the late 1950s.<ref name=Zoglin/>

In this period Carlin perfected what is perhaps his best-known routine, "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]", recorded on ''[[Class Clown]]''. On July 21, 1972 Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] and charged with violating [[obscenity]] laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears|author=Jim Stingl|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=March 23, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven," was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience (''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', 438 U.S. 726 (1978); the court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine).<ref name="EFF">{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/FCC_v_Pacifica/fcc_v_pacifica.decision |title=FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation |date=July 3, 1978 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version, and accompanying the credits in the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' special for the 1982–83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |title=BBS - Incomplete List of Impolite Words |publisher=George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120406052624/http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |archivedate=2012-04-06 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

On stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album ''FM & AM'' had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album ''Occupation: Foole'', he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaimed "Shit!" and proudly announced his win to the audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pfcmUzGhw#t=2355 |title=George Carlin - Occupation: Foole}}</ref>

Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', on October 11, 1975, the only episode to date in which the host did not appear (at his request) in sketches.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Geoffrey Hammill, The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm |title=Saturday Night Live |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020820194836/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm |archivedate=2002-08-20 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Carlin however loved the show and encouraged Michael McKenzie to write a book on it, which he did in 1978 [http://books.google.com/books/about/Backstage_at_Saturday_Night_Live.html?id=7avxxrY1OHkC [Backstage At Saturday Night Live!/Scholastic Books<nowiki>]</nowiki>.] The following season, 1976–77, he appeared regularly on [[CBS]] Television's ''[[Tony Orlando & Dawn]]'' variety series.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'' series. He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] during this layoff period.<ref name="bravo">{{cite episode|title=George Carlin|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]|airdate=October 31, 2004|season=1|number=4}}</ref> His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing ''[[A Place for My Stuff]]'' and returning to HBO and New York City with the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' TV special, videotaped at [[Carnegie Hall]] and airing during the 1982–83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

He hosted ''SNL'' for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time appearing in several sketches.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin's acting career was primed with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Shelley Long]]; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the [[1960s counterculture]]. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the titular characters in ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and reprised his role in the film sequel ''[[Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' as well as the first season of the [[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|cartoon series]]. He also played the role of "Mr Conductor" on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' and narrating the show's sequences of the American version of ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' from 1991 to 1995, replacing [[Ringo Starr]]. In 1996  he continued to play the role as "Mr Conductor" on ''[[Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales]]'', and ''[[Storytime with Thomas]]''. After the cancelation of ''Shining Time Station'', ''[[Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales]]'', and ''[[Storytime with Thomas]]'' he left and was replaced in 1998 by [[Alec Baldwin]] for the [[Thomas and Friends (series 5)|fifth]] onwards.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', which starred [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Barbra Streisand]]. He portrayed the gay neighbor of the main character's suicidal sister.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin began a weekly [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom, ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'', in 1993, playing New York City [[taxicab]] driver George O'Grady. <!--He quickly included a variation of the "seven words" in the plot.--> The show, created and written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' co-creator [[Sam Simon]], ran 27 episodes through December 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html|title=1990–1999|publisher=GeorgeCarlin.com|date=|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}</ref> In his final book, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'', Carlin said about ''The George Carlin Show'', "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members [[Alex Rocco]], [[Chris Rich]], [[Anthony Starke|Tony Starke]]. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] ... I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."<ref>''Last Words', Simon & Schuster, 2009'</ref>

Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I don't begrudge them. I don't hate paying taxes, and I'm not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But I'll tell you what it did for me: It made me a way better comedian.

Carlin was honored at the 1997 [[Aspen Comedy Festival]] with a retrospective, ''[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]]. His first hardcover book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|title=The Kennedy Center |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> In 1999 Carlin played a supporting role as a satirical [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Roman Catholic cardinal]] in [[Kevin Smith]]'s movie ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. He worked with Smith again with a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', and later played an atypically serious role in ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 movie)|Jersey Girl]]'' as the [[blue-collar]] father of [[Ben Affleck]]'s character.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== 2000s ===
In 2001 Carlin was given a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the 15th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]].
In December 2003 Representative [[Doug Ose]] (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",<ref name=HR3687>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h3687: |title=Bill Summary & Status 108th Congress (2003 - 2004) H.R.3687 |publisher=Library of Congress  THOMAS |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." (The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlin's original seven words.) The bill was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution]] in January 2004, where it was tabled.<ref name=HR3687 />

Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], but in 2004 his run at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are". He continued:
{{quotation|"People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects."}}
When an audience member shouted "Stop degrading us!", Carlin responded "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.<ref name="tagreviewj">{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |title=Dark Carlin |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date=December 4, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041207042940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |archivedate=2004-12-07 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=George Carlin enters rehab |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 29, 2004 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

Following his thirteenth HBO Special on November 5, 2005, titled ''[[Life Is Worth Losing]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/events/gcarlin/?ntrack_para1=insidehbo3_text|title=Carlin: Life is Worth Losing |publisher=HBO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060115070120/http://www.hbo.com/events/gcarlin/?ntrack_para1=insidehbo3_text |archivedate=2006-01-15 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> and aired live from the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in New York City&nbsp;— during which he mentioned, "I've got 341 days of sobriety"&nbsp;— Carlin toured his new material through the first half of 2006. Topics included suicide, [[natural disaster]]s, [[cannibalism]], [[genocide]], [[human sacrifice]], threats to [[civil liberties]] in America, and the case for his theory that humans are inferior to other animals. At the first tour stop at the Tachi Palace Casino in [[Lemoore, California]] in February, Carlin mentioned that the appearance was his "first show back" after a six-week hospitalization for heart failure and [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin voiced a character in the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', which opened on June 9, 2006. The character, Fillmore, is an anti-establishment hippie [[VW Microbus]] with a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] paint job and the license plate "51237"&nbsp;— Carlin's birthday. In 2007 Carlin voiced the wizard in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', his last film. Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', aired live on March 1, 2008 from the [[Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2007-09-24-carlin-collection_N.htm |title=George Carlin reflects on 50 years (or so) of 'All My Stuff' |author=Wloszczyna, Susan |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 24, 2007 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Themes included "American bullshit", rights, death, old age, and child rearing.

== Personal life ==
Carlin met Brenda Hosbrook while touring with Burns and Carlin in [[Dayton, Ohio]] in August 1960. They were married at her parents' home in Dayton on June 3, 1961.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |pages=89–92}}</ref> The couple's only child, [[Kelly Carlin|Kelly]], was born on June 15, 1963. In 1971 the couple renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. Brenda died of [[liver cancer]] on May 11, 1997, the day before Carlin's 60th birthday.<ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/339/000022273/</ref>

In November 1997, Carlin met Sally Wade, a comedy writer based in Hollywood; Carlin described it as "love at first sight", but was hesitant to act on his feelings so soon after Brenda's death.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |pages=272}}</ref> They eventually married on June 24, 1998, in a private, unregistered ceremony.

== Themes ==
Carlin's material falls under one of three self-described categories: "the little world" (observational humor), "the big world" (social commentary), and the peculiarities of the English language ([[euphemisms]], [[doublespeak]], [[business jargon]]), all sharing the overall theme of (in his words) "humanity's bullshit", which might include murder, genocide, war, rape, corruption, religion and other aspects of human civilization. He was known for mixing observational humor with larger social commentary. His delivery frequently treated these subjects in a [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[nihilism|nihilistic]] fashion, such as in his statement during the ''Life is Worth Losing'' show:<blockquote>I look at it this way... For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers... so when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.</blockquote>

Language was a frequent focus of Carlin's work. Euphemisms that seek to conceal or distort meaning, and the use of pompous, presumptuous, or silly vocabulary, were often the target of Carlin's routines. When asked on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' what turned him on, he responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him proudest of his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.

Carlin also gave special attention to prominent topics in [[American Culture|American]] and [[Western culture]], such as obsession with fame and celebrity, [[consumerism]], conservative Christianity, [[political alienation]], corporate control, hypocrisy, child raising, fast food diet, news stations, [[self-help]] publications, blind patriotism, sexual taboos, certain uses of technology and surveillance, and the "pro-life" position,<ref>"Abortion" in the HBO Special ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''</ref> among many others. For example, Carlin often criticized elections as an illusion of choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsQ7jJJcEA|title=1:46|publisher=Youtube.com|date=April 6, 2008|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}</ref> He said the last time he voted was in 1972, for [[George McGovern]], who ran for President against [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://althouse.blogspot.com/2004/11/george-carlin.html |title=George Carlin |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

Carlin openly communicated in his shows and in his interviews that his purpose for existence was entertainment, that he was "here for the show." He professed a hearty ''[[schadenfreude]]'' in watching the rich spectrum of humanity slowly self-destruct, in his estimation, of its own design, saying, "When you're born, you get a ticket to the freak show. When you're born in America, you get a front-row seat." He acknowledged that this is a very selfish thing, especially since he included large human catastrophes as entertainment. In his ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'' performance, he elaborated somewhat on this, telling the audience, "I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for the sake of entertainment. And I've always been willing to put ''you'' at great personal risk, for the same reason!"

In the same interview, he recounted his experience of a California earthquake [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|in the early 1970s]] as "an amusement park ride. Really, I mean it's such a wonderful thing to realize that you have ''absolutely'' no control, and to see the dresser move across the bedroom floor unassisted is just exciting."

A routine in Carlin's 1999 HBO special ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'' focusing on [[airport security]] leads up to the statement: "Take a fucking chance! Put a little fun in your life! Most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous fun, and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one." Along with wordplay and sex jokes, Carlin had always included politics as part of his material, but by the mid-1980s he had become a strident social critic in both his HBO specials and the book compilations of his material, bashing both conservatives and liberals alike.

Carlin often criticized religion, God, and religious adherents in his comedy. He described what he saw as the flaws of organized religion in interviews and performances, such as his "Religion" and "There Is No God" routines in ''[[You Are All Diseased]]''. In his last HBO stand up show, ''It's Bad for Ya'', he mocked traditional oath affirmations on the Bible as "bullshit",<ref>{{cite web |title=Religion is bullshit |author=George Carlin |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT6rL2UroE |work=YouTube |format=video |deadurl=no}}</ref> "make believe", and "kid stuff"; however, in the same show, he warned, "Be happy, don't be proud, there's too much pride as it is. 'Pride goeth before the fall' - never forget ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]''."<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=It's Bad for Ya|titlelink=It's Bad for Ya |year=2008 |chapter=Proud to Be an American |first=George |last=Carlin |authorlink=George Carlin |type=album |publisher=[[Eardrum Records]]}}</ref> He described the types of hats that religions ban, or require, as part of their practices, and remarked that he would never want to be a part of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin joked in his second book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'', that he worshipped the [[Sun]] because he could see it, and prayed to [[Joe Pesci]] "because he seems like a guy who could get things done". In a 2008 interview, Carlin stated that using [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]] helped him in his personal life.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jay Dixit |date=June 23, 2008 |title=George Carlin's Last Interview |work=Psychology Today |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200806/george-carlins-last-interview?page=4 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

== Health problems, death, and legacy ==
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning several decades. These included three heart attacks (in 1978, 1982, and 1991), an [[arrhythmia]] requiring an [[ablation]] procedure in 2003, and a significant episode of heart failure in late-2005.

For a number of years Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled ''New York City Boy''. After his death [[Tony Hendra]], his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release as ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]''. The book, chronicling most of Carlin's life and future plans (including the one-man show) was published in 2009.

== Internet hoaxes ==
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site [[Snopes]], an online resource that debunks [[urban legend]]s and myths, has addressed these forgeries. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlin's viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying, "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff." [[Weird Al Yankovic]] referenced these hoaxes in a line of his song "[[Alpocalypse#Track listing|Stop Forwarding That Crap To Me]]" by saying "And by the way, those quotes from George Carlin aren't really George Carlin".<ref>
