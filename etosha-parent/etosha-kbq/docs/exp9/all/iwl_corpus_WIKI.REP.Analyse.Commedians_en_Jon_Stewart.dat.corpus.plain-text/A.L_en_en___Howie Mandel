'''Howard Michael''' "'''Howie'''" '''Mandel''' (born November 29, 1955) is a Canadian comedian, actor, television host, and voice actor. He is well known as host of the [[NBC]] game show ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', as well as the show's [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. syndicated game show)|daytime]] and [[Deal or No Deal Canada|Canadian-English]] counterparts. Before his career as a game show host, Mandel was best known for his role as rowdy ER intern Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the NBC medical drama ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. He is also well known for being the creator and star of the children's cartoon ''[[Bobby's World]]''. On June 6, 2009, he hosted the [[2009 Game Show Awards]] on [[Game Show Network|GSN]]. Mandel became a judge on [[NBC]]'s ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', replacing [[David Hasselhoff]], in the fifth season of the reality talent contest. Mandel has [[mysophobia]] (an irrational fear of germs) to the point that he does not shake hands with anyone, including contestants on ''Deal or No Deal'', unless he is wearing latex gloves.

==Early life==
Mandel was born and lived in the [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] area of [[Toronto]], Ontario. Mandel is Jewish and he is a distant cousin to violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/21/news/tv-61937 | title=New Afternoon Arrival | publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' | date=June 21, 1998 | accessdate=24 July 2014 | author=Brownfield, Paul}}</ref> His father was a lighting manufacturer and a real estate agent.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/9/Howie-Mandel.html Howie Mandel Biography (1954–) (Film Reference) ]</ref> After getting expelled from his high school for impersonating a member of the school board and signing a construction contract to make an addition to his school,<ref>[http://imdb.com/name/nm0005177/bio Howie Mandel (I) – Biography (Internet Movie Database)]</ref> Mandel became a carpet salesman who would later open a carpet  sales business of his own. He was a stand-up comedian at [[Yuk Yuk's]] in Toronto and by September 1978 had a week-long booking as featured act, billed as "a wild and crazy borderline [[psychosis|psychotic]]."<ref>[[Toronto Star]], September 12, 1978, p. D1</ref> His repertoire included placing a latex glove over his head and inflating it by blowing through his nose, the fingers of the glove extending above his head like a [[Chicken crest|cockscomb]]. When the audience reacted uproariously to that and similar antics, his trademark response was to extend his arms palms up, look incredulous, and ask "What? What?"

On a trip to [[Los Angeles]], Mandel performed a set at [[The Comedy Store]], which resulted in his becoming a regular performer there. A producer for the comedic game show ''[[Make Me Laugh]]'' saw him and booked Mandel for several appearances during the show's run in 1979. He was booked to open for [[David Letterman]] at shows in the summer of 1979.<ref>[[Toronto Star]], July 19, 1979, p. C6</ref> [[CBC-TV]]'s head of variety programming saw his performance in October 1979 and immediately signed him for a TV special. In 1980, he won the lead role in the Canadian movie ''[[Gas (1981 film)|Gas]]'', co-starring [[Susan Anspach]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. 
Mandel was one of the first "VeeJays" to appear on [[Nickelodeon|Nickelodeon's]] music video series, ''[[Pop Clips]]''.

==TV and film career==
[[Image:Howie Mandel at the 39th Emmy Awards.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Mandel at the 39th Emmy Awards in 1987]]

Mandel came to national attention in the U.S. during a six-year run on ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', starting in 1982 and playing the role of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, opposite the late [[Ed Flanders]] and [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], with whom he remains good friends as of 2015. While working as Dr. Fiscus, and continuing to work as a comedian, he also did movies, including his role as the voice of Gizmo in the 1984 hit ''[[Gremlins]]'' and its 1990 sequel ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]''.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/55390/gremlins-and-gremlins-2-new-batch-hit-blu-ray-check-out-some-clips Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch Hit Blu-ray! Check Out Some Clips]</ref>  In 1985 Mandel made a cameo in the [[Michael J. Fox]] directed short "The Iceman Hummeth" which was subsequently broadcast on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in November 1985. In 1986, he starred in ''[[A Fine Mess (film)|A Fine Mess]]'' alongside [[Ted Danson]]. He performed his stand-up comedy act in several cities (the ''Watusi Tour''), which was followed by his ''Watusi'' music video in 1987. For the first two seasons of ''[[Muppet Babies]]'', he voiced [[Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] and [[Skeeter (Muppet)|Skeeter]]. He starred on the 1987 comedy film ''[[Walk Like a Man (1987 film)|Walk Like a Man]]''. He was also "Maurice" in the 1989 movie ''[[Little Monsters]]''. In 1990, he starred in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Good Grief (TV series)|Good Grief]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. Mandel also hosted the first season, 2012, of the game show Take It All. He was also the creator and executive producer of the Emmy-nominated children's [[animated series]] ''[[Bobby's World]]'' (1990–1998), to which he supplied the voices of the title character and his father (using Howie's "normal" voice for Bobby's dad). ''Bobby's World'' ran for eight seasons on Fox and was later [[Television syndication|syndicated]]. Mandel also plays his alter-ego, Phil Skorjanc, in most of his comedy shows and these are a fan favorite. Bobby also made a cameo appearance in a February 2007 episode of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. On a special 2-hour Christmas episode, first aired on December 25, 2007, Mandel delivered one line with Bobby's voice, as per request of the contestant.

In 1994 Mandel voiced the lead character, Little Howie, of the video game ''[[Tuneland]]''. He starred in the sketch comedy series, ''Howie Mandel's Sunny Skies'', in 1995 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Mandel appeared in the 1995 [[Clint Black]] [[country music]] video "[[Summer's Comin']]". He played the lead role of the professor in the short-lived TV series ''[[The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys]]'', and guest-starred on a 1996 episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' as [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. In 1998 he hosted his own syndicated talk show, [[The Howie Mandel Show]], which was canceled after one season. In 1999/2000, Mandel played "Jason" in the film ''[[Apocalypse III: Tribulation]]'', and in 2002 played the Sand Man in the movie ''[[Hansel and Gretel (2002 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]''.  In 2006, he appeared as himself as a guest host in a [[parody]] of ''Deal or No Deal'' in the [[show-within-a-show]] of the TV series ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. In 2007, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of NBC's ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'', making a dream cameo of himself on ''Deal or No Deal.'' In that episode, he booted off the nighttime drama's protagonist for "cheating", since in the show he is a [[psychic]] medium and appeared to "know" the contents of the cases.

Mandel's signature stunt as a stand-up comedian (besides his Bobby alter-ego) was stretching a [[latex glove]] over his head and inflating it with his nostrils, filling it until it suddenly propelled itself off his head. This trick also lent itself to the title and cover photo of his comedy album, ''Fits Like a Glove'' (1986). He eventually gave up the routine under doctor's orders after being diagnosed with a perforated sinus. However, in a cameo role as himself on ''[[My Name is Earl]]'', he did the routine. He guest starred in two episodes of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' ("Mr. Monk Joins a Cult" and "[[Mr. Monk's 100th Case]]").

==Later work==
Mandel is known for his frequent appearances as a comedian and for his [[hidden camera]] segments on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. He has appeared in many television commercials for [[Boston Pizza]] as their hired spokesperson. In April 2004, he was selected as number 82 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand up comedians of all time. In October 2005, he was named to be the host of the U.S. version of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', which debuted on December 19, 2005, on [[NBC]] and became a popular program in early 2006. Mandel also hosts ''[[Deal or No Deal Canada]]''; originating from Toronto, ''Deal or No Deal Canada'' debuted in January 2007 on [[Global Television Network|Global]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/globalshows/et_story.html?id=fe168ca7-8b94-45ea-a76a-9b487f1690ef&k=78245|title=Deal or No Deal, eh?|work=Canada.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> which made him one of the few game show

Mandel joins [[Alex Trebek]], [[Jim Perry (television)|Jim Perry]] and [[Geoff Edwards]] on the list of game show hosts who emceed one game show simultaneously on both sides of the U.S./Canadian border.

Mandel had a cameo appearance as himself on the NBC show ''[[My Name is Earl]]'', in the episode Earl's roommates robbed an Indian casino at which Howie Mandel was performing.

The show then went to daytime with Mandel remaining as host, although [[Arsenio Hall]] was originally intended to host the show. In a January 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Mandel expressed mild, jovial frustration over how some of his contestants hold out during the game show, despite the fact that the grand prize is many times what they would make in a year.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat.

Mandel received a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/news/the-stars-align-12th-annual-canadas-walk-fame|title=The Stars Align at the 12th Annual Canada's Walk of Fame |date=June 16, 2009|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref>  He is the third game show host to be inducted (the first being [[Monty Hall]] in 2002 and the second being [[Alex Trebek]] in 2006).

In October 2008, Mandel revealed that he has [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) on the morning talk show ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', adding that he is currently working to raise adult ADHD awareness among the general public. On January 12, 2009, Mandel was reportedly sent to [[St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto|St. Michael's Hospital]] in [[Toronto]] suffering from chest pains and what was reported as a minor heart attack. According to various news reports, he was experiencing an irregular heartbeat, but the reports were later revealed as inaccurate. He was later released.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/13/howie.mandel.hospitalized/index.html |publisher=CNN | title=Game show host Howie Mandel out of hospital| date=January 13, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Mandel has written and published an in-depth autobiography which details his life with [[OCD]], [[ADHD]], and comedy, called ''[[Here's the Deal: Don't Touch Me]]''.

Mandel is a fan of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] hockey team.<ref>http://metronews.ca/features/toronto-maple-leafs-the-playoffs/644148/famous-fans-of-the-toronto-maple-leafs/</ref>

===Mysophobia===
[[File:Howie Mandel SAMHSA.jpg|left|thumb|Mandel speaking at a government function on mental health.]]
Mandel has [[mysophobia]] (a pathological fear of contamination/germs) to the point that he does not shake hands with anyone, including enthusiastic contestants on ''Deal or No Deal'', unless he is wearing latex gloves. Instead of shaking contestants' hands when they offer them, Mandel often opts to exchange [[fist pound]]s, put his hands on contestants' shoulders, or give an occasional hug. He once kissed a female contestant on the show for good luck despite his mysophobia. He now takes medicine to control his condition and even pokes fun at himself for it. He revealed on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on March 24, 2006, that his shaved head is not related to natural hair loss, but to his mysophobia. He stated that the lack of hair makes him feel cleaner.<ref>[http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1143176400 HALLE THE HUMORLESS] Howard Stern official site, March 24, 2006</ref> In the back yard of Mandel's house is a second, smaller house which he had built especially to live in solitary when members of his family are sick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZNnz9SM4g|title=Howie Mandel Talks About Living With OCD|author=ABC News|date=2009-11-29}}</ref>  During his appearance on ''[[Mad TV]]'', Mandel and cast member [[Bobby Lee]] made fun of the former's condition.

In September 2007, Mandel interviewed former [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Marshall Faulk]] on [[NFL Network]]. Faulk asked him to shake hands, but Mandel declined, noting he'd rather have the fist tap, as he does with ''Deal or No Deal'' contestants. Seconds later, Faulk subjected him to a "sneak attack", and shook his right hand. Mandel screamed and walked away from Faulk. He then washed his hands several times. On a guest appearance on ''[[Free Radio (TV series)|Free Radio]]'', Mandel explained that not only is he afraid of public bathrooms, but is unable to use any bathroom other than his own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=28247050 |title=Video – MySpace Video |publisher=MySpace|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref>

During the season 5 episode of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' in Chicago, Zach Carty attempted an act involving sneezing. Mandel ran off to the far end of the theater until the act was over. (Carty was unable to perform the act.) Mandel kept yelling at the other judges, [[Piers Morgan]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]] to press the X buttons and for the audience to turn in his direction. Morgan eventually pressed the X button but Osbourne refused so Mandel promptly ran over and pressed her button ending the act. In a backstage interview, he expressed to the television audience that he receives therapy to help him cope. In another ''America's Got Talent'' season 5 incident, Dan Sperry, a contestant on the YouTube quarterfinal episode, dropped some dental floss that he had run through his neck as part of a magic act. He dropped the floss in Mandel's vicinity, prompting him to get up and run to the other side of the judges' table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n7Y9EA17yQ |title=YouTube video |publisher=YouTube|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> Just before Sperry's next performance in the semifinals, Mandel admitted that it was "the most horrified" he'd been on the show and that his therapist "loves [Dan Sperry]," because there had been two extra sessions that week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjueImBkTDw |title=YouTube video |publisher=YouTube|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref>

Mandel commented in 2011 that he has struggled with the condition since childhood, but did not seek help until he was an adult:
{{quote|"I don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel there was an issue. But I wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood. I’ve always felt a little bit different, and I always knew I wasn’t as comfortable with life as everybody else seemed to be. But I didn’t know what I could do about it. When I was a kid, I didn’t know anybody who went to a psychiatrist. There was always a stigma attached to mental health issues. I think there still is. But now I’m taking care of myself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Howie-Mandel.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Howie Mandel Interview with Chet Cooper"'' (2011)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref>}}
