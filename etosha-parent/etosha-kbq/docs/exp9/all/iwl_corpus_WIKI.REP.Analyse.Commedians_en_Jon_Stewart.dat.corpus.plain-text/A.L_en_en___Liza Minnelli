'''Liza May Minnelli''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|l|aɪ|z|ə|_|m|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|ɪ|}}, born March 12, 1946) is an American [[actress]] and [[singer]] best known for her portrayal of Sally Bowles in the 1972 musical film ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' which won her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Born to film actress and singer [[Judy Garland]] (1922–1969) and film director [[Vincente Minnelli]] (1903–1986), Liza Minnelli never went on to become a child or teenage star. In her teens, she started as a musical theatre actress, nightclub performer and [[traditional pop]] recording artist in [[New York City]]. Critically lauded for her dramatic performance in the film ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969), she rose to international stardom with ''Cabaret'' and the [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]]-winning TV special ''[[Liza with a Z]]'' (1972). Most of her following film projects got mixed reviews and failed commercially, and she had no major movie hit except the 1981 comedy ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''. She successfully returned to Broadway stage starring the musical ''[[The Act (musical)|The Act]]'' in 1977. Primarily known as a pop standard singer, she recorded contemporary singer-songwriter material through the late 1960s and 1970s which mostly failed to chart.

Struggling with drug abuse, Minnelli became one of the first prominent people openly talking about [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. From the late 1970s on, concert tours and nightclub performances have focused on her work. She did highly regarded performances at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1979 and 1987, and at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in 1991 and 1992. Switching between old school entertainment and contemporary music in the late 1980s, she both toured ''Frank, Liza & Sammy: The Ultimate Event'' alongside [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and recorded the pop album ''[[Results]]'' produced by the British duo [[Pet Shop Boys]]. Many of her albums are live records.

Struggling with [[viral encephalitis]], Minnelli returned with her concert show ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in 2002 and made critically acclaimed guest appearances in the sitcom ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' from 2003 to 2013, while continuing to tour internationally and performing ''[[Liza's at The Palace...!]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008/2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/2009_Tony_Award_Winner_Lizas_at_The_Palace_For_Best_Special_Theatrical_Event_20090607|title=2009 Tony Award Winner: Liza's at The Palace For 'Best Special Theatrical Event|author=Broadway World.com|date=June 7, 2009|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

Minnelli is considered both as an American and [[gay icon]]. She has won an Academy Award, being nominated once more, two [[Golden Globe Awards]], one Emmy Award, two [[Tony Awards]], in addition to one [[Grammy Legend Award]] and one [[Special Tony Award|Special Tony]], as well as many other industry and critics awards.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/awardperson.asp?id=68333 IBDB Person Awards].

Minnelli has a half-sister, [[Lorna Luft|Lorna]], and half-brother, Joey, from Garland's marriage to [[Sid Luft]]. She also has another half-sister, Christiane Nina Minnelli (nicknamed Tina Nina), from her father's second marriage.<ref name=LunchGuardian>{{cite web|url=http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/celebrity/story/0,,2272373,00.html|title=Lunch with a legend|accessdate=April 12, 2008 |last=Brockes|first=Emma|authorlink=Emma Brockes|date=April 12, 2008|work=The Guardian|location=UK}}</ref>
Minnelli's godparents were [[Kay Thompson]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]. Her parents named her after Ira Gershwin's song "[[Liza (All the Clouds'll Roll Away)]]". Thompson was most notable as author of the ''[[Eloise (books)|Eloise]]'' book series for children, which was partly inspired by the antics of Minnelli when she was young. The character of Eloise was illustrated by [[Hilary Knight]].<ref>[http://www.salon.com/1999/06/01/eloise/ Will the real Eloise please stand up? – Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Career==

===Theatre===
During 1961, Minnelli was an apprentice at the Cape Cod Melody Tent, [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]], [[Massachusetts]]. She appeared in the chorus of ''Flower Drum Song'' and played the part of Muriel in ''Take Me Along''. Minnelli began performing professionally at age 17, in 1963, in an [[Off-Broadway]] revival of the musical ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]'', for which she received the Theatre World Award. The next year, her mother invited her to perform with her at the [[London Palladium]]. She attended Scarsdale High School for one year, starring in a production of ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' which then went to Israel on tour. She turned to Broadway at 19, and in 1965 she became the youngest woman ever to win a leading actress [[Tony Awards|Tony Award]] for ''[[Flora the Red Menace]]''. It was the first time she worked with the musical duo [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]].

===Music===
Minnelli began as a nightclub singer as an adolescent, making her professional nightclub debut at the age of 19 at the [[Shoreham Hotel]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. She later appeared in other clubs and on stage in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], and [[New York City]]. Her success as a live performer led to her recording several albums at [[Capitol Records]]: ''[[Liza! Liza!]]'' (1964), ''[[It Amazes Me]]'' (1965), and ''[[There Is a Time]]'' (1966). In her early years, she recorded [[Traditional pop music|traditional pop]] standards as well as show tunes from various musicals in which she starred. Because of this fact, William Ruhlmann named her “[[Barbra Streisand]]'s little sister”.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Minnelli_Liza/Discography/Index/P3130/1/1] starpulse.com</ref> The Capitol albums ''Liza! Liza!'', ''It Amazes Me'', and ''There Is A Time'' were reissued on the two-CD compilation ''The Capitol Years'' in 2001, in their entirety.

[[File:Liza Minnelli 1988.jpg|thumb|left|Liza Minnelli on Sunset Boulevard 1988.]]
From 1968 to the 1970s, she also recorded her albums ''[[Liza Minnelli (album)|Liza Minnelli]]'' (1968), ''[[Come Saturday Morning (Liza Minnelli album)|Come Saturday Morning]]'' and ''[[New Feelin']]'' (both 1970) from [[A&M Records]]. She released ''[[The Singer (Liza Minnelli album)|The Singer]]'' (1973) and ''[[Tropical Nights (Liza Minnelli album)|Tropical Nights]]'' (1977) from [[Columbia Records]].

In 1989 Minnelli collaborated with [[Pet Shop Boys]] on ''[[Results]]'', an electronic dance-style album. The release hit the top 10 in the UK and also charted in the US, spawning four singles: ''[[Losing My Mind]]''; ''[[Don't Drop Bombs]]''; ''[[So Sorry, I Said]]''; and ''[[Love Pains]]''. Initially released on VHS titled ''Visible Results'', the clips were later issued on a bonus DVD included in the 2005 remastered and expanded edition of the album. Later that year she performed ''Losing My Mind'' live at the Grammys ceremony before receiving a Grammy Legend Award (the first Grammy Legend Awards were issued in 1990 to Minnelli, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[Smokey Robinson]], and [[Willie Nelson]]). With this award, she became one of only 12 other entertainers – in a list that includes [[Rita Moreno]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and [[Mel Brooks]] among others – to win an [[Emmy]], [[Grammy]], [[Tony Award]], and [[Academy Award]].<ref>[[List of people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award|"List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards"]],wikipedia.org.

In 1996, Minnelli released a new studio album titled ''[[Gently (album)|Gently]]''. It was a recording of jazz standards and also included some contemporary songs such as the cover of ''[[Does He Love You]]'' which she performed as a duet with [[Donna Summer]]. This album brought her a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]]. Minnelli was nominated in 2009 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her studio recording ''[[Liza's at the Palace...!]]'', based on her hit Broadway show.

In May 2010, Playbill.com reported Minnelli would be releasing an album on the [[Decca Records]] label entitled ''Confessions'', which was released on September 21, 2010.<ref name="playbill.com">[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/139436-Liza-Minnellis-Confessions-CD-Due-in-September-Artwork-Revealed Liza Minnelli's "Confessions" CD Due in September; Artwork Revealed].

In 2006, Minnelli appeared on [[My Chemical Romance]]'s album ''[[The Black Parade]]'', providing backing vocals and singing a solo part with [[Gerard Way]] on the track "Mama."

===Film===
Her first appearance on film is as the baby in the very last shot of her mother's film, ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949). Her first credited film role was as the [[love-interest]] in [[Albert Finney]]'s only film as director and star, ''[[Charlie Bubbles]]'' (1967), although four years later she did voice-over work for the animated film ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]'', a sequel to the 1939 [[MGM]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Minnelli was the voice of Dorothy (a character played in the earlier film by her mother [[Judy Garland]]) in what would have been her first major role had it been released as originally scheduled in 1964—the [[Filmation]] production took eight years to finish due to financial difficulties and would be ultimately be released between 1972 and 1974.

In 1969 she appeared in [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s first feature film, ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969), as “Pookie Adams”, a needy, eccentric teenager. Her performance won her her first Academy Award nomination. She played another eccentric character the following year in ''[[Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon]]'', directed by [[Otto Preminger]].

In 1972, Minnelli appeared in perhaps her best-known film role, as [[Sally Bowles]] in the movie version of ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]''. She said that one of the things she did to prepare was to study photographs of classic actresses [[Louise Glaum]] and [[Louise Brooks]] and the dark-haired ladies of that time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liza Minnelli: Be "strange and extraordinary", her father once told her. She listened – Interview|first=Ingrid|last=Sischy|date=February 2004}}</ref> Minnelli won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her performance, along with a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and also a "Sant Jordi Award" and a "David di Donatello Award" for Best Foreign Actress.

Following the success of ''Cabaret'', [[Bob Fosse]] and Minnelli teamed up for ''[[Liza with a Z|Liza with a ‘Z’. A Concert for Television]]'', a made-for-television special. The program aired two times on TV and was not seen again until a DVD release in 2006.

Minnelli worked with her father in the 1976 ''[[A Matter of Time (film)|A Matter of Time]]'', co-starring [[Ingrid Bergman]]. After severe editing and cutting, done by the studio, with no input from Vincente, the film was neither a commercial nor a critical success {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} . Her appearance opposite [[Robert De Niro]] in the 1977 musical drama film, ''[[New York, New York (film)|New York, New York]]'', however, gave Minnelli her best known [[signature song]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] released a successful [[cover version]] (for his ''[[Trilogy: Past Present Future]]'' album) two years later and used it as his signature song as well, sometimes even duetting with Minnelli live on stage.

After her performance as leading woman to [[Dudley Moore]] in 1981's hit film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'', Minnelli made fewer film appearances although she returned to the big screen in 1988 for ''[[Arthur 2: On the Rocks]]'' and in 1991 for ''[[Stepping Out (1991 film)|Stepping Out]]'', a musical dramedy.

Most recently she made an appearance in the movie ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' (2010) as herself.

===Television===
[[File:Baryshnikov - Minnelli 1981 TV.jpg|thumb|with [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] in ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'', 1980]]
During the early days of television in the 1950s Minnelli appeared as a child guest on [[Art Linkletter]]'s show and in 1959 sang and danced with [[Gene Kelly]] on his first television special. She was a guest star in one episode of the popular [[Ben Casey]] television series starring [[Vince Edwards]] and was a frequent guest on chat shows of the day including numerous appearances on shows hosted by [[Jack Paar]], [[Merv Griffin]], [[Mike Douglas]], [[Joe Franklin]], [[Dinah Shore]] and [[Johnny Carson]]. During the 1960s she made several guest appearances on ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh In]]'' as well as other variety shows including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', as well as ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. In 1964 she appeared as Minnie in her first television dramatic role in the episode "Nightingale for Sale" on [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]]'s short-lived [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] series, ''[[Mr. Broadway]]''.

Recently, Minnelli has made guest appearances on such shows as ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' and ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]''. In the UK she has appeared on the [[Ruby Wax]], [[Graham Norton]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] shows and in October 2006 participated in a comedy skit on the [[Charlotte Church]] Show and was featured on the [[Michael Parkinson]] Show.
Set to be a guest judge on Australian Idol 2009 on the October 18, 2009. She appeared on ''[[The Joy Behar Show]]'' of September 1, 2010.

In November 2009, American Public Television aired "Liza's at the Palace", taped from September 30 – October 1, 2009 in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand's Hollywood Theatre.<ref>[http://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/bpt/A29BB5F22345E3F385257631006757C9?OpenDocument Concert and DVD] aptonline.org.</ref> The executive producers of the taping, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, previously were involved with the 2005 rerelease of 1972's Emmy and Peabody Award winning "Liza with a 'Z'".<ref>Cox, Gordon (September 17, 2009) [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008782.html?categoryid=15&cs=1&ref=bd_legit Liza’s ‘Palace’ to get TV reprise]. ''Variety''.</ref>

In 2013 she made guest appearance in the NBC series Smash. She sang a special song accompanied by character Tom to rising broadway star Ivy Lynn.

===Later career===
[[File:Liza stage2.jpg|thumb|left|Performing ''Liza's Back'' live in 2002.]]
She returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical ''[[Victor/Victoria (musical)|Victor/Victoria]]'', replacing [[Julie Andrews]]. In his review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic Ben Brantley commented, “her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond.”{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1995 Minnelli and long time collaborator Billy Stritch recorded a number of American standards "unplugged", and were coveted by many to be the Holy Grail of Minnelli's career, showing a sultrier and softer, more interpretive side to her artistry. The songs were later released in 2010, making the album "Confessions".

After a serious case of [[viral encephalitis]] in 2000, doctors predicted that she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and would perhaps not even be able to speak again. However, she refused to accept this and with the help of vocal and dance lessons (most notably with [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), which she still takes daily, managed to recover and returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend [[Michael Jackson]] to perform at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City where she sang "Never Never Land" and the televised "You Are Not Alone" at the [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concert produced by soon to be husband [[David Gest]]. Minnelli told reporters, "I am stable as a table." Gest was so impressed with her stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in spring 2002 performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. (Most noted in that tour was a tribute to her mother. After years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song, "[[Over The Rainbow]]", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's famous anthem, to an instant ovation.) Among performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included "I Believe You" by [[The Carpenters]], a rap version of "Liza With A 'Z'", "Yes", and [[Mary J. Blige]]'s [[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|"Family Affair"]], 2001.

[[VH1]] signed on Minnelli and Gest in 2002 to appear in a [[reality show]] entitled "Liza & David". The pilot episode was filmed following the couple around as they prepared for a party at their home, with a guest list including [[Ray Charles]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Isaac Mizrahi]], [[Anastacia]], among many others. The show was cancelled shortly after the pilot episode was filmed due to a dispute between Gest, Minnelli and [[VH1]], and never aired. Recordings of the pilot episode still exist.

In 2004 and 2005 she appeared as a recurring character on the critically acclaimed, [[Emmy Award]]-winning TV sitcom ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' as “[[Lucille Austero]]”, the lover of both the sexually and socially awkward [[Byron "Buster" Bluth|"Buster" Bluth]] and Buster's brother “[[George Oscar "G.O.B." Bluth II|GOB]].”

[[File:Liza Minnelli 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Liza Minnelli at the 2005 [[Toronto Film Festival]] premiere of ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]''.]]
In September 2006, she made a guest appearance on the long-running [[NBC]] drama ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'', in ''Masquerade'', a Halloween-themed episode, broadcast on Tuesday, October 31, 2006.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-09-29-minelli_x.htm Minnelli to guest star on 'Law & Order'] October 1, 2006</ref> She also completed guest vocals on [[My Chemical Romance]]'s 2006 concept album ''[[The Black Parade]],'' portraying “Mother War,” a dark conception of the main character's mother, in the song ''[[Mama (My Chemical Romance song)|Mama]]''.

For years, Minnelli had wanted to record a collection of songs that her godmother [[Kay Thompson]] had performed in her nightclub act.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In 2007, she added some of Thompson's songs to her latest tour to introduce them to audiences.

Minnelli returned to Broadway in a new solo concert at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] called ''[[Liza's at The Palace...!]]'' which ran from December 3, 2008, through January 4, 2009.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124222.html Liza's at The Palace . . .!

The show was subsequently staged at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on September 30 and October 1, 2009, at which time it was filmed for broadcast on public television and a February 2010 DVD and Blu-ray release.

Minnelli has no children; one pregnancy left her with a [[hiatal hernia]] as a result of the medical steps taken to try to save the baby.<ref name=LunchGuardian/>

===Philanthropy===
Minnelli has, throughout her lifetime, served various charities and causes which she considers very important. She served on the board of directors of [[The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential]] (IAHP) for 20 years, a nonprofit educational organization that introduces parents to the field of child brain development. In a 2006 interview with Randy Rice at Broadwayworld.com Minnelli said that she was the person who told Elizabeth Taylor about HIV/AIDS while talking about their mutual friend, Rock Hudson.<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/An-Interview-with-Liza-Minnelli-20061201 An Interview with Liza Minnelli<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She has also dedicated much time to [[amfAR]], The Foundation for AIDS Research, which was co-founded by Taylor. In 2007, she stated in an interview with Palm Springs Life magazine, “AmfAR is important to me because I’ve lost so many friends that I knew [to AIDS]”.<ref name=odell>Holly O’Dell {{Wayback |date=20110714230120 |url=http://www.officiallizaminnelli.com/careerarchive/articles/2007-November-PPS.html |title=Legendary Liza }}. ''Palm Springs Life''</ref> In 1994, she recorded the Kander & Ebb tune "The Day After That" and donated the proceeds to AIDS research. That same year she performed the song in front of thousands in Central Park at the 25th anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots]].

It is thought that Minnelli is the only actress with the distinction of being an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner whose parents were both [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners; however Judy Garland never won a competitive Oscar. Although her father won Best Director for ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'', her mother received an [[Academy Juvenile Award|honorary Juvenile Oscar]] for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile for the previous year. It was given to her at the [[13th Academy Awards|1940 Academy Awards]] for her performances in 1939 including ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.
