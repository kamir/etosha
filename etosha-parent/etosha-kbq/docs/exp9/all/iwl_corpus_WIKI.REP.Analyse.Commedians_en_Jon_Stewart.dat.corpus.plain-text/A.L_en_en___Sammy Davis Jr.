'''Samuel George''' "'''Sammy'''" '''Davis Jr.''' (December 8, 1925&nbsp;– May 16, 1990) was an American entertainer. Primarily a dancer and singer, he was also an actor of stage and screen, musician, and impressionist, noted for his [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonations]] of actors, musicians and other celebrities. At the age of three Davis began his career in [[vaudeville]] with [[Sammy Davis Sr.|his father]] and [[Will Mastin]] as the [[Will Mastin Trio]], which toured nationally. After military service Davis returned to the trio. Davis became an overnight sensation following a nightclub performance at [[Ciro's]] (in West Hollywood, California) after the [[24th Academy Awards|1951 Academy Awards]]. With the trio, he became a recording artist. In 1954, he lost his left eye in an automobile accident, and several years later, he converted to [[Judaism]].<ref name="biography1">[http://www.biography.com/people/sammy-davis-jr-9268223 Sammy Davis Jr. Biography].

Davis's film career began as a child in 1933. In 1960, he appeared in the first [[Rat Pack]] film, ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]''. After a starring role on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1956's ''[[Mr. Wonderful (musical)|Mr Wonderful]]’’. He returned to the stage in 1964's ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]].” In 1966 he had his own TV variety show, ''The Sammy Davis Jr. Show''. Davis's career slowed in the late 1960s, but he had a hit record with "[[The Candy Man]]" in 1972 and became a star in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], earning him the nickname "Mister Show Business".<ref>Casey Kasem's American Top 40 – The 70's from April 29 & May 6, 1972</ref><ref>[http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?id=893 Sammy Davis Jr.: Mr. Show Business].

As an African-American, Davis was the victim of racism throughout his life and was a large financial supporter of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|Civil Rights movement]]. Davis had a complex relationship with the African-American community, and drew criticism after physically embracing President [[Richard M. Nixon]] in 1972. One day on a golf course with [[Jack Benny]], he was asked what his [[Handicap (golf)|handicap]] was. "Handicap?" he asked. "Talk about handicap — I'm a one-eyed Negro Jew."<ref name="Time1960">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826061,00.html ''Religion: Jewish Negro'' ] [[Time Magazine]] February 1, 1960</ref><ref name="Ebony">Sammy Davis Jr. [http://books.google.com/books?id=OkbpkXl3lMwC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=ebony+handicap++one-eyed+negro+jew&source=bl&ots=p0RS8j948H&sig=uawfiC9sQkPBS6y2HzfWmtJQqfs&hl=en&ei=WiD-SqVvhPyxA9vQiYgL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Is My Mixed Marriage Mixing Up My Kids''] – ''[[Ebony Magazine]]'' October 1966 p. 124</ref> This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography, and in countless articles.<ref name="forward">Rebecca Dube [http://www.forward.com/articles/106316/ ''Menorah Illuminates Davis Jr.'s Judaism''] ''[[The Forward]]'' May 29, 2009</ref>

After reuniting with Sinatra and [[Dean Martin]] in 1987, Davis toured with them and [[Liza Minnelli]] internationally, before he died of throat cancer in 1990. He died in debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], and his estate was the subject of legal battles.<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10749525/legalzoom-will-upheld-in-sammy-davis-jr-estate-battle.html LegalZoom Will Upheld In Sammy Davis, Jr. Estate Battle – TheStreet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Davis was awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] and an [[Emmy Award]] for his television performances. He was the recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1987, and in 2001, he was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==Early life==
Samuel George Davis Jr., was born on December 8, 1925, in the [[Harlem]] section of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], as an only child, to [[Sammy Davis Sr.]], an African-American entertainer, and [[Elvera Sanchez]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E5DB1239F93BA3575AC0A9669C8B63 |title=Elvera Sanchez Davis, obituary, September 8, 2000 |work=The New York Times |date=September 8, 2000 |accessdate=September 18, 2009}}</ref> a tap dancer of [[Afro-Cuban]] descent. At age 7 Davis played the title role in the film ''[[Rufus Jones for President]]'', in which he sang and danced with [[Ethel Waters]]<ref>{{YouTube|qM5bqTWtGY8|Michael Bublé & Frank Sinatra Jr. on George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight (2012)}}. Retrieved on 2013-05-12.</ref> During his lifetime, Davis stated that his mother was [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] and born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].  However, in the 2003 biography ''In Black and White'' author, Wil Haygood, writes that Davis's mother was born in New York City to parents of [[Cuban American|Cuban]], Afro-Cuban, and African-American descent, and that Davis claimed he was Puerto Rican because he feared anti-Cuban backlash would hurt his record sales.<ref>{{cite news | title=What Made Sammy Dance? | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005947,00.html | work=Time | date=October 23, 2003 | accessdate=May 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/10/14/1996-10-14_extra__extra__late-breaking_.html |title=Extra!

Davis's parents were vaudeville dancers. As an infant, he was reared by his paternal grandmother. When he was three years old, his parents separated. His father, not wanting to lose custody of his son, took him on tour.

[[File:Will Mastin Trio.jpg|thumb|Will Mastin Trio: (L–R) Sammy Davis Sr., Sammy Davis Jr., and Will Mastin]]
Davis learned to dance from his father and his "uncle" [[Will Mastin]], who led the dance troupe his father worked for. Davis joined the act as a child and they became the [[Will Mastin Trio]]. Throughout his career, Davis included the Will Mastin Trio in his billing. Mastin and his father shielded him from racism. Snubs were explained as jealousy, for instance. When Davis served in the [[United States Army]] during World War II, however, he was confronted by strong racial prejudice. He later said, "Overnight the world looked different. It wasn't one color any more. I could see the protection I'd gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I'd never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I'd walked through a swinging door for eighteen years, a door which they had always secretly held open."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davis, Jr.|first1=Sammy|last2=Boyer|first2=Burt|last3=Boyer|first3=Jane |title=Sammy: an autobiography: with material newly revised from Yes I can and Why me|trans_title= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=yugNi3r5mIYC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=It+was+as+if+I'd+walked+through+a+swinging+door+for+eighteen+years,+a+door+which+they+had+always+secretly+held+open#v=onepage&q=It%20was%20as%20if%20I'd%20walked%20through%20a%20swinging%20door%20for%20eighteen%20years%2C%20a%20door%20which%20they%20had%20always%20secretly%20held%20open&f=false|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2000|origyear= |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|language= |isbn=9780374293550|oclc=43567619|doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |layurl= |laysource= |laydate= |author-mask= |author-name-separator= |author-separator= |display-authors= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Sammy Davis Jr.jpg|thumb|Sammy Davis Jr., during the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 March on Washington]]]]
During service in WWII, the Army assigned Davis to an integrated entertainment [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] unit and he found that the spotlight lessened the prejudice. Even prejudiced white men admired and respected his performances. "My talent was the weapon, the power, the way for me to fight. It was the one way I might hope to affect a man's thinking," he said.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sammy Davis Jr. | url=http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/people/sammy_davis.htm | publisher=Oral Cancer Foundation | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 14, 2008}}</ref>

After his discharge, Davis rejoined the family dance act, which played at clubs around [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon. He began to achieve success on his own and was singled out for praise by critics, releasing several albums.<ref>E.g. ''Billboard'', July 25, 1953, p. 11.</ref> This led to Davis being hired to sing the title track for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' in 1954,<ref>{{cite book|last=Haygood|first=Wil|title=In black and white: the life of Sammy Davis Jr|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3R1aAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=January 14, 2011|date=October 7, 2003|publisher=A.

In 1959, Davis became a member of the famous Rat Pack, led by his friend [[Frank Sinatra]], which included fellow performers [[Dean Martin]], [[Joey Bishop]], and [[Peter Lawford]], a brother-in-law of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Initially, Sinatra called the gathering "the Clan", but Davis voiced his opposition, saying that it reminded people of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Sinatra renamed the group "the Summit", but the media referred to them as the Rat Pack, the name of its earlier incarnation led by [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]]. The group made several movies together, including the original version of ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (1960), ''[[Sergeants Three]]'' (1962), and ''[[Robin and the Seven Hoods]]'' (1964), as well as many joint stage appearances in Las Vegas and elsewhere.

Davis was a headliner at [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|The Frontier Casino]] in Las Vegas, but he was required (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house on the west side of the city, instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other black artists could entertain, but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places which practiced [[racial segregation]].<ref>Sammy Davis Jr., Burt Boyar, and Jane Boyar, ''Sammy: The Autobiography of Sammy Davis Jr.'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000).</ref>

In 1964, Davis was starring in ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]]'' at night and shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When he could get a day off from the theater, he would be recording new songs in the studio, or performing live, often at charity benefits as far away as [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], and Las Vegas, or doing television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis knew he was cheating his family of his company, but he could not help himself; as he later said, he was incapable of standing still.

Although he was still a draw in Las Vegas, Davis's musical career had sputtered by the late 1960s, although he had a No. 11 hit (#1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening singles chart]]) with "[[I've Gotta Be Me]]" in 1969. His effort to update his sound and reconnect with younger people resulted in his signing with the [[Motown]] record label.<ref>{{cite web | author=Eugene Chadbourne | title=Sammy Davis Jr. Now | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r109246|pure_url=yes}} | work=Allmusic | year=2008 | accessdate=May 14, 2008}}</ref> Though his deal with them to have his own label with the company fell through, Sammy had an unexpected #1 hit with "[[The Candy Man]]" after he signed with [[MGM Records]] in 1972. Although he did not particularly care for the song and was chagrined that he was now best known for it, Davis made the most of his opportunity and revitalized his career. Although he enjoyed no more Top 40 hits, he did enjoy popularity with his 1976 performance of the theme song from the ''[[Baretta]]'' TV series, "Baretta's Theme (Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow)" (1975–1978), which was released as a single ([[Fox Music|20th Century]] [[20th Century Fox Records|Records]] 2282). He occasionally landed television and film parts, including cameo visits to the television shows ''[[The Rifleman]]'' on two different episodes, ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'' (during which he famously kisses [[Archie Bunker]] ([[Carroll O'Connor]]) on the cheek) and, with wife [[Altovise Davis]], on ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. In the 1970s, he appeared in commercials in Japan for [[Suntory]] whiskey.

[[File:Sammy Davis Jr. performing 1966.JPG|thumb|180px|Davis performing in 1966.]]
On December 11, 1967, NBC broadcast a musical-variety special entitled ''[[Movin' With Nancy]]''. In addition to the Emmy Award-winning musical performances, the show is notable for [[Nancy Sinatra]], daughter of Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr. greeting each other with a kiss, one of the first black-white kisses in U.S. television history.<ref>{{cite interview|subject=Nancy Sinatra|interviewer=Larry King|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/17/lklw.00.html|format=transcript|program=[[Larry King Live]]|callsign=[[CNN]]|date=June 17, 2000|title=Nancy Sinatra Reminisces; Alan Dershowitz Talks About Justice; Hamilton Jordan Discusses Cancer; Lou Cannon Puts Reagan in Perspective}}</ref>

Davis had a friendship with [[Elvis Presley]] in the late 1960s, as they both were top-draw acts in Vegas at the same time. Davis was in many ways just as reclusive during his hotel gigs as Elvis, holding parties mainly in his penthouse suite, and Elvis went to them occasionally. Davis sang a version of Presley's song "[[In The Ghetto]]" and made a cameo appearance in Presley's concert film ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. One year later, he made a cameo appearance in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', but the scene was cut.

In Japan, Davis appeared in television commercials for coffee, and in the United States, he joined Sinatra and Martin in a radio commercial for a Chicago car dealership.

On May 27–28, 1973 Davis hosted (with Monte Hall) the first annual, twenty-hour Highway Safety Foundation [[telethon]]. Guests included [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Jack Barry (singer)|Jack Barry]], [[Dr. Joyce Brothers]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Joe Franklin]], [[Cliff Gorman]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Steve Leeds]],<ref name="NYDN">{{cite news

Davis was a fan of daytime soap operas, particularly the shows produced by the [[American Broadcasting Company]]. This led to a cameo appearance on ''[[General Hospital]]'' and a recurring role as character Chip Warren on ''[[One Life to Live]]'', for which he received a [[Daytime Emmy]] nomination in 1980. He was also a game show fan, appearing on the ABC version of ''[[Family Feud]]'' in 1979. He appeared on ''[[Tattletales]]'' with his third wife [[Altovise Davis]] in the 1970s. He made a cameo during an episode of the [[NBC]] version of ''[[Card Sharks]]'' in 1981.

In addition to American soaps, he was also a huge fan of the Australian show ''[[Prisoner: Cell Block H]]''. Davis wanted to make an appearance in ''Prisoner'', but the show ended (in 1986) before this could be arranged.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

Davis was an avid photographer who enjoyed shooting pictures of family and acquaintances. His body of work was detailed in a 2007 book by Burt Boyar, named ''Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyar|first=Burt|title=Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr.|year=2007|publisher=Regan Books|location=New York|isbn=9780061146053|page=338|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}</ref> "Jerry [Lewis] gave me my first important camera, my first 35 millimeter, during the Ciro's period, early '50s," Boyar quotes Davis. "And he hooked me." Davis used a [[medium format camera]] later on to capture images. Again quoting Davis, "Nobody interrupts a man taking a picture to ask ... 'What's that nigger doin' here?'" His catalog includes rare photos of his father dancing onstage as part of the Will Mastin Trio and intimate snapshots of close friends Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, James Dean, Nat "King" Cole, and Marilyn Monroe. His political affiliations also were represented, in his images of Robert Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. His most revealing work comes in photographs of wife [[May Britt]] and their three children, Tracey, Jeff and Mark.

Davis was an enthusiastic shooter and gun owner. He participated in fast-draw competitions—Johnny Cash recalled that Sammy was said to be capable of drawing and firing a [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver in less than a quarter of a second.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hurst|first=Jack|title=Johnny Cash's War Within|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-26/features/9408260197_1_american-recordings-fast-draw-sin-and-redemption|accessdate=April 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 26, 1994}}</ref> Davis was skilled at fast and fancy [[gunspinning]], and appeared on TV variety shows showing off this skill. He appeared in Western films and as a guest star on several "Golden Age" T.V. Westerns.

==Personal life==

===Car accident and conversion to Judaism===
Davis nearly died in an automobile accident on November 19, 1954, in [[San Bernardino, California]], as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.<ref name=sbsun>[http://google.com/search?q=cache:EwyGE84vj0EJ:www.sbsun.com/living/ci_10594121+Sammy+Davis+Jr+accident&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=us Sammy Davis Jr. Turns Near Tragedy into Triumph], ''San Bernardino Sun'', September 28, 2008{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref> In 1953, he had struck up a friendship with comedian and host [[Eddie Cantor]], who gave him a [[mezuzah]].

While in San Bernardino's Community Hospital, Eddie Cantor told him about the similarities between the [[Judaism|Jewish]] and black cultures.

===Marriages===
In 1957, Davis was involved with [[Kim Novak]], a young actress under contract to [[Columbia Studios]]. The head of Columbia studio, [[Harry Cohn]], was worried about the negative effect this would have on the studio because of the prevailing taboo against [[miscegenation]]. He called his friend, mobster [[Johnny Roselli]], who was asked to tell Davis that he had to stop the affair with Novak. Roselli arranged for Davis to be kidnapped for a few hours to throw a scare into him. His hastily arranged and soon-dissolved (after nine months) marriage to black dancer Loray White in 1958 was an attempt to quiet the controversy.<ref>{{cite book | last=Reid | first=Ed |author2=Demaris, Ovid  | title=The Green Felt Jungle | location=Cutchogue, New York | publisher=Buccaneer Books | year=1963 | lccn=63022217}}</ref> In a 2014 BBC documentary, it was disclosed that Cohn arranged for Davis to be threatened with having his other eye put out or his leg broken if he did not marry a black woman within 48 hours. At his wedding celebration he became so inebriated that his friend, Arthur Silber, put him to bed. Upon checking later, Silber caught him holding a loaded pistol to his head. The marriage to Loray White was never consummated - Davis having offered to pay her $10,000 to enter into a sham marriage. <ref> December 2014 BBC documentary," Sammy Davis, Jr."The Kid in the Middle"</ref>

In 1960, Davis caused controversy again when he married white [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born actress [[May Britt]]. Davis received hate mail while starring in the [[Broadway musical]] adaptation of ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]]'' during 1964–66 (for which he received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actor). At the time Davis appeared in the play, interracial marriages were forbidden by law in 31 US states (but were entirely legal in New York), and only in 1967 were those laws ruled [[unconstitutional]] by the [[US Supreme Court]].<ref>''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.</ref> Davis and Britt had one daughter Tracey and adopted two sons.<ref name="biography1"/> Davis performed almost continuously and spent little time with his wife. They divorced in 1968, after Davis admitted to having had an affair with singer [[Lola Falana]]. That year, Davis started dating [[Altovise Gore]], a dancer in ''Golden Boy''. They were married on May 11, 1970, by the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]]. [[Kathy McKee]] replaced Altovise in Davis's nightclub act. They adopted a son, Manny, in 1989. Davis and Altovise remained married until his death in 1990.

===Political beliefs===
[[File:Davis Nixon 1973.jpg|thumb|200px|Sammy Davis Jr., in the [[Yellow Oval Room]] of the [[White House]] with President [[Richard Nixon]], March 4, 1973]]

Davis was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Jacobs | first=George |author2=Stadiem, William  | title=Mr. S.: The Last Word on Frank Sinatra | location=New York | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2003 | isbn=0-06-051516-3}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, he startled President Nixon with a hug during a live television broadcast. The incident was controversial.  Davis also made a [[USO]] tour to [[South Vietnam]] at Nixon's request.

Previously Davis had won Nixon's respect with his participation in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Nixon invited Davis and his wife, Altovise, to sleep in the White House in 1973, the first time African Americans were invited to do so. The Davises spent the night in the [[Queens' Bedroom]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/weekinreview/09harris.html?ref=weekinreview | work=The New York Times | title=The Underside of the Welcome Mat | first=Gardiner | last=Harris | date=November 9, 2008 | accessdate=April 10, 2010}}</ref>

Davis was a long-time donor to the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]]'s [[Operation PUSH]] organization. The Reverend Jesse Jackson also performed Davis's wedding.<ref>"Davis supports Jackson", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', February 6, 1984, p. 1</ref>

==Death==
Davis died in [[Beverly Hills, California]], on May 16, 1990 at age 64, of complications from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter B.

He was 64 years old and had been in deteriorating health since his release from Cedar-Sinai Medical Center on March 13. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 17, 1990 |accessdate=2014-12-11 }}</ref> Earlier, when he was told that surgery ([[laryngectomy]]) offered him the best chance of survival, Davis replied he would rather keep his voice than have a part of his throat removed; he subsequently was treated with a combination of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation therapy|radiation]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sue Rochman | title=The Cancer That Silenced Mr. Wonderful's Song | url=http://www.crmagazine.org/home/magazine/summer-2007.aspx?d=487 | journal=Cancer Research Magazine | volume=2 | issue=3 | year=2007 | accessdate=May 14, 2008}}</ref> However, a few weeks prior to his death, his entire [[larynx]] was removed during surgery.<ref name=Haygood516/> He was interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]], next to his father and Will Mastin.

On May 18, 1990, two days after Davis's death, the neon lights of the [[Las Vegas Strip]] were darkened for ten minutes as a tribute to him. He was survived by his wife, his daughter, his sons, his sister, his mother, his grandmother, and two grandchildren.
