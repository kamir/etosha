In 1932, Thomas began performing on radio in Detroit at [[WDTK|WMBC]] on ''The Happy Hour Club''.  Thomas first performed under his [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] birth name, "Amos Jacobs Kairouz." After he moved to Chicago in 1940, Thomas did not want his friends and family to know  he went back into working clubs where the salary was better, so he came up with the pseudonym "Danny Thomas" (after two of his brothers).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/obituaries/danny-thomas-79-the-tv-star-of-make-room-for-daddy-dies.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|title=Danny Thomas, 79, the TV Star Of 'Make Room for Daddy,' Dies|date=7 February 1991|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref>

He can be found living in Ward 6, Toledo, Lucas County, Ohio, in the 1920 U. S. Census as Amos Jacobs, the same in the 1930 Census, and in 1940 living in Ward 2, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, as Amos J. Jacobs, a radio and theatrical artist. Further, the 1930 Census states his parents were born in Syria; while the 1920 Census states that they were born in "Seria", and that their mother tongue is "Serian".<ref>{{cite census|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/X44C-62N|title=U.S.Census of 1930|date=26 April 1930|publisher=U.

==Career before television==
[[File:Danny thomas jerry dingle baby snooks 1945.JPG|thumb|180px|Thomas as Jerry Dingle, 1945]]

===Radio===
Thomas first reached mass audiences on network radio in the 1940s playing shifty brother-in-law Amos in ''[[The Bickersons]]'', which began as sketches on the music-comedy show ''[[Drene Time]]'', co-hosted by [[Don Ameche]] and [[Frances Langford]]. Thomas also portrayed himself as a scatterbrained Lothario on this show. His other network radio work included a stint as Jerry Dingle the postman on [[Fanny Brice]]'s ''[[The Baby Snooks Show]]'', and appearances on the popular NBC variety program, ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'', hosted by stage legend [[Tallulah Bankhead]].

Thomas also had his own radio program, ''The Danny Thomas Show''. The 30-minute weekly variety show was on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1942-43 and on [[CBS]] in 1947-48.<ref name="sies1">Sies, Luther F. (2014). ''Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1''. McFarland & Company, Inc. ISBN 978-0-7864-5149-4. P. 177.</ref>

===Films===
In films, Thomas starred in ''[[The Jazz Singer (1952 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' opposite the popular contemporary vocalist Peggy Lee, a 1952 remake of [[The Jazz Singer|the 1927 original]], and played songwriter [[Gus Kahn]] opposite [[Doris Day]] in the [[1951 in film|1951]] film biography ''[[I'll See You in My Dreams (1951 film)|I'll See You in My Dreams]].''

==Television career==

===''Make Room For Daddy'' (''The Danny Thomas Show'')===
Thomas enjoyed a successful 13-year run (1953–1965) on ''Make Room For Daddy,'' later known as ''The Danny Thomas Show''. [[Jean Hagen]] and [[Sherry Jackson]] were his first family. The Hagen character died in 1956, replaced by [[Marjorie Lord]].  On January 1, 1959, Thomas appeared with his ''Make Room For Daddy'' child stars, [[Angela Cartwright]] and [[Rusty Hamer]], in an episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]].''

[[File:Danny Thomas Angela Cartwright.JPG|thumb|160px|Danny plays house with television daughter Linda]] 
The show was produced at Desilu Studios, where [[Lucille Ball]] was appearing alongside [[Desi Arnaz|Desi Arnaz Sr.]] in ''[[I Love Lucy]],'' and it featured several guest stars who went on to star in their own shows, including [[Andy Griffith]] (''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''Mayberry RFD''), [[Joey Bishop]], and [[Bill Bixby]] (''[[My Favorite Martian]]'' and others). He also scored a major success at the London Palladium, in the years when many big American stars appeared there.
[[File:DThomas.jpg|thumb|130px|Thomas and Cartwright]]

In the 1970s, the program was revived, but had a short run, under the title ''Make Room for Granddaddy.'' (See below.)

Cartwright (who spoke about her on- and off-camera relationship with her TV stepfather, Danny Thomas, on a groundbreaking ABC TV show, ''Make Room for Daddy'') had said: "I thought Danny was hilarious and he was always cracking me up. He was loud and gregarious, nothing like my real Dad who is far more reserved than that. So, it was fun to be able to make smart remarks and get away with it. I would never have talked to my real parents that way, but in the make-believe world of the Williams family I got away with that." Cartwright also added by the time Thomas' show had ended, if she wanted to join the cast of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'': "I went on an interview for the part of Brigitta. I was still filming ''The Danny Thomas Show'', but I knew the series was coming to an end. After several auditions, I was the first von Trapp cast. I asked Danny Thomas if he would let me out of my contract so I could be in the movie and he was very gracious to let me out of the last show of the season. He didn’t have to do that and I am very grateful he did."<ref>http://www.classicfilmtvcafe.com/2013/05/angela-cartwright-talks-with-cafe-about.html</ref>

===Producer===
Thomas became a successful television producer (with [[Sheldon Leonard]] and [[Aaron Spelling]] among his partners) of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', and ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. Thomas also produced three series for [[Walter Brennan]]: ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'', and ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'' on ABC during the late 1950s and 1960s. Thomas often appeared in cameos on shows he produced, including his portrayal of the tuxedoed, droll alien Kolak, from the planet Twilo, in the ''Dick Van Dyke Show'' science-fiction spoof, "It May Look Like a Walnut".

Thomas was responsible for [[Mary Tyler Moore]]'s first "big break" in acting. In 1961, Carl Reiner cast her in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' after Thomas personally recommended Moore. He had remembered her as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier, but rediscovered her after a lengthy search through photos and records.

===Return to television===
In the early 1970s, Thomas reunited most of his second ''Daddy'' cast ([[Marjorie Lord]], [[Rusty Hamer]], and [[Angela Cartwright]]) for a short-lived update of the show, ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. Premised around Danny and Kathy Williams caring for their grandson by daughter Terry, who was away with her husband on a long business assignment, the show lasted one season.

By the mid-1970s, Thomas' son [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony]] had become an accomplished television producer. Tony, along with [[Paul Junger Witt]], formed [[Witt/Thomas Productions]] in 1975, and was responsible for his father's next three (and ultimately final) starring vehicles. Thomas returned to series TV in the NBC sitcom, ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]'', from January 1976 to January 1977, and after that ''[[I'm a Big Girl Now]]'', which aired on ABC from 1980 to 1981.

The last series in which Thomas was a headlining star was ''[[One Big Family (TV series)|One Big Family]]'', which aired in [[television syndication|syndication]] during the 1986–1987 season. The situation comedy's premise was set around a semiretired comedian whose grandchildren were orphaned after their parents were killed in a car accident.<ref>Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prine Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present,'' 20th Anniversary Edition, Ballantine Books, New York, 1999, p. 758-759.</ref>

===Commercials===
Thomas, like many actors prominent in television, endorsed commercial products. In particular, two companies that featured him in their advertising were [[Maxwell House]], whose instant coffee he endorsed (though it had no decaffeinated variant at the time, he later claimed he had been endorsing a "decaffeinated" instant coffee and the coffee he actually drank had a high caffeine content), and [[Philips]] [[Norelco]]'s "Dial-A-Brew" version of its short-lived "Better Cup Of Coffee" line of electric drip coffee-makers. One of his other "commercials" was actually a public-service message, with fund-raising goals, for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

===St. Jude Children's Research Hospital===
As a "starving actor", Thomas had made a vow: If he found success, he would open a shrine dedicated to [[Jude the Apostle|St. Jude Thaddeus]], the patron saint of hopeless causes. Thomas never forgot his promise to St. Jude, and after becoming a successful actor in the early 1950s, his wife joined him and began traveling the United States to help raise funds to build his dream - St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Thomas Story|url=http://www.stjude.tv/danny_thomas_story.cfm|publisher=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>  He fervently believed “no child should die in the dawn of life.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Thomas Forever Stamp|url=http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?

Since its inception, St. Jude has treated children from all 50 states and around the world, continuing the mission of finding cures and saving children. Dr. [[Peter C. Doherty]] of St. Jude's Immunology Department, was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1996 for key discoveries on how the immune system works to kill virus-infected cells.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1996/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1996]</ref>
