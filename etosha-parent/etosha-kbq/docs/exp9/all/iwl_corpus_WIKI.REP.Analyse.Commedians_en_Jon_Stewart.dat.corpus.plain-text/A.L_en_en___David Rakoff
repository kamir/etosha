Retrieved January 20, 2010.</ref> Rakoff
wrote to Sedaris in 1992, after hearing him read on the radio his essay about being a Christmas elf, which was to make him famous. That day, he wrote to Sedaris immediately to ask if he could publish Sedaris's works (which he later confessed he had no intention of doing, since he was desperate to leave publishing).<ref>Dowling, Brendan, [http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/pla/plapublications/publiclibraries/mayjun08.pdf "The limits of my paltry imagination"], ''Public Librarians'' May/June 2008.

Through Sedaris, Rakoff met Ira Glass, who was then a junior reporter on the [[NPR]] radio program ''[[Morning Edition]]''. When Ira Glass began ''This American Life'', Rakoff became involved with the new show at its inception.<ref>Salazar-Rubio, Sofia, [http://www.dailycal.org/article/100565/interview_author_david_rakoff_on_the_charmed_life "Author David Rakoff on the Charmed Life of a Writer"], ''The Daily Californian'', February 2, 2008.

====''Fraud''====
''Fraud'' includes essays that are largely autobiographical and humorous. Rakoff stated, in relation to the theme of the book: "The central drama of my life is about being a fraud, alas". He went on to say "That's a complete lie, really; the central drama of my life is about being lonely, and staying thin, but fraudulence gets a fair amount of play."<ref>Rakoff, David, "In New England, Everyone Calls You Dave" in ''Fraud: essays'' (2001), p 17.</ref> He has said that he thought of other titles for ''Fraud'', like "Smart mouth" and "The jig is up".<ref name="januarymagazine2001">Richards, Linda, [http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/rakoff.html "David Rakoff"], ''January Magazine'', November, 2001. Retrieved January 20, 2010.</ref> Rakoff described the first person essays that comprise the collection as more inwardly focused than his later work. The work contains material from public radio's ''This American Life'' and from ''Outside'' and ''Salon'', which was significantly lengthened and re-written, as well as a few new pieces.<ref>Seven of the stories ("In New England Everyone Calls You Dave", "Arise, Ye Wretched of the Earth", "Before & After Science", "Hidden People", "Christmas Freud", "We Call it Australia" and "I Used to Bank Here, but That Was Long, Long Ago") first appeared on Public Radio International's ''This American Life'', "Including One Called Hell" and "The Best Medicine" first appeared in ''GQ'', "Extraordinary Alien" appeared in ''The New York Times Magazine'', "Back to the Garden" in ''Outside'' and "Tokyo Story" in ''Conde Nast Traveler''.</ref> The book received praise from many critics, garnering near-unanimous acclaim. In a review [[Publishers Weekly]] wrote that "a talented new humorist springs onto the scene: Rakoff has a rapier wit, slashing in all directions with slice-of-life insights and cutting remarks, sometimes nicking himself with self-deprecation in his dexterous duel with the American experience".<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Fraud-Essays-David-Rakoff/dp/product-description/0767906314 Extract from Publishers Weekly review].</ref> Kevin Cowherd said that in the book, Rakoff "makes a strong bid for the title of Most Neurotic Man on the Planet, and the results are absolutely hilarious – when they're not achingly revealing and tinged with sadness"<ref>Cowherd, Kevin, "Rakoff's essays could win him the title of Most Neurotic Man on the Planet, ''The Baltimore Sun'', May 26, 2001.</ref> and Max Magee called the collection a "meta-article in which he talks about the particulars and relative merits of his assignment as he embarks on that assignment",<ref name="themillions2005">Magee, Max, [http://www.themillions.com/2005/05/fraud-by-david-rakoff.html "Fraud: review"], ''themillions.com'', May 10, 2005.

The reviewer in ''The New York Times'' mentioned (by way of criticism) that [[Sophocles]] and Freud had also pursued the same idea that forms the book's focus, that is, that we are defined by our fears.<ref name="nytimes2001">Cho, Christina, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E2D71731F937A15755C0A9679C8B63&scp=10&sq=%22david%20rakoff%22&st=cse "Books in Brief: Fraud"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 24, 2001.

====''Don't Get Too Comfortable''====
''Don't Get Too Comfortable,'' which is subtitled "The Indignities of Coach Class, The Torments of Low Thread Count, The Never-Ending Quest for Artisanal Olive Oil, and Other First World Problems" was published in 2005 and also consists of comical autobiographical essays. Some of the essays were originally published in shorter form elsewhere and some original.<ref>Sesion Privada" was published in ''Details,', "Wildman" in ''Seed,'' "As It Is in Heaven," "Beat Me, Daddy," "Whatsizface" and "Off We're Gonna Shuffle" in ''GQ''; "JDV, MIA, "Martha, My Dear" and "Faster" on ''This American Life'' and "I Can't Get It For You Wholesale" in ''Harper's Bazaar.''</ref> The over-riding theme of the articles is the absurdity and excessiveness in American life: the book is about luxuries and privileges being treated as deserved rights. Rakoff said that the moral of the book is that there should be "a little more guilt out there" and "we could all, myself included, count our blessings, acknowledge our privileges."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The book was generally praised by critics.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.readings.com.au/review/don-t-get-too-comfortable-david-rakoff "Review by Kevin Clark"], "readings"; [http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-don-t-get-too-comfortable-david-rakoff "Book review: Don't get Too Comfortable"], ''Llliterarty.

A third book of essays, ''Half Empty'' was published in September 2010.<ref>[http://www.barclayagency.com/rakoff.html Barclay's website]. Retrieved January 20, 2010.</ref> Rakoff said the book is "essentially about pessimism and melancholy: all the other less than pleasant to feel emotions that because they are less than pleasant to feel have been more or less stricken from the public discourse but in fact have their uses and even a certain beauty to them".<ref name="dailycal1"/> Rakoff argued that it is "a defence of melancholy, pessimism, anxiety and all of the emotions that have been tarred with the brush of negativity and therefore stricken from the larger cultural conversation. I hope to argue...that, while these emotions may well be hedonistically less pleasant, they remain necessary and even beautiful at times."

==Acting and voice work==
Rakoff said that his first career choice was to be an actor: he wrote, "like generations of other misfits before me, be they morphological, sexual or otherwise, I decided that I would make theatre my refuge". Rakoff performed in the theatre at university and acted while working full-time in the publishing industry and later while freelancing as a writer.<ref name=kharakh>Kharakh, Ben, [http://gothamist.com/2007/06/29/david_rakoff_wr.php "David Rakoff, Author, Fraud and Don't Get Too Comfortable"], ''gothamist'', June 29, 2007.

Retrieved January 20, 2010.</ref>

Despite his ambitions as a child, he said that he only pursued acting half-heartedly, partly because his family was against him being an actor<ref name=kharakh/> and partly because of the stereotyping that unimaginative casting agents engage in.<ref name=allen>Allen, Sandra, [http://www.wagsrevue.com/Download/Issue_4/David%20Rakoff.pdf "David Rakoff"], "Wag's Revue''.
