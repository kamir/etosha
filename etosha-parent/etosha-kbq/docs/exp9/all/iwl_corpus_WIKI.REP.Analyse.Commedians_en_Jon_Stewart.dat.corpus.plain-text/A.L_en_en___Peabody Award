The '''George Foster Peabody Awards''' (or simply '''Peabody Awards''') program, named for American businessman and philanthropist [[George Foster Peabody|George Peabody]], recognizes distinguished and meritorious public service by American [[radio]] and [[television stations]], networks, online media, producing organizations, and individuals. 

Reflecting excellence in quality, rather than popularity or commercial success, the Peabody is awarded to about 25–35 winners annually from more than 1,000 entries.<ref name="Shearer">{{cite web|first=Lee |last=Shearer |url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/032701/uga_0327010006.shtml |title=UGA names new Peabody director |work=[[Athens Banner-Herald]] |date=2001-03-27 |accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref><ref name="dailycourier">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0UwLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=11IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,4207961&dq=peabody-award+television+1948&hl=en |work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]] |date=September 26, 2002 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |publisher=[[Google News]] |first=Frazier |last=Moore |authorlink=Frazier Moore |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Emmys over?

==History==
In 1939, the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] formed a committee to recognize outstanding achievement in [[radio broadcasting]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQ1SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KzUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2642,2766145&dq=1939+national+association+of+broadcasters+peabody&hl=en |work=[[The Albany Herald]] |publisher=[[Google News]] |date=1989-01-19 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Broadcasters Honor Rusk}}</ref> Committee member Lambdin Kay, public-service director for [[WSB (AM)|WSB radio]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], Georgia, at the time, is credited for creating the award, named for businessman and philanthropist [[George Foster Peabody]], who donated the funds that made the awards possible.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Radio: New Order of Merit |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765429,00.html |magazine=[[TIME]] |publisher=Time Inc. |date=7 April 1941 |accessdate=14 September 2009}} {{Subscription required|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref name="thestreet">{{cite news|agency=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11048680/60-minutes-journalist-to-deliver-ugas-peabody-smithgall-lecture.html |title=60 Minutes Journalist To Deliver UGA's Peabody-Smithgall Lecture |publisher=[[TheStreet.com]] |date=2011-03-16 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref> Fellow WSB employee Lessie Smithgall introduced Lambdin to John E.

The Peabody Awards were originally only for [[radio]], but in 1948 [[television]] awards were introduced. In the late 1990s additional categories for material distributed via the [[World Wide Web]] were added.<ref name="dailycourier"/> Materials created solely for theatrical [[motion picture]] release are not eligible.

==Peabody judging==
The Peabody Awards judging process is unusually rigorous.<ref name="variety"/> Evaluation of the more than 1,000 entries typically received begins in early February with some 30 committees composed of a number of [[University of Georgia]] faculty or staff members and selected students.<ref name="thecitizen">{{cite web|first=Lance |last=Cummins |url=http://www.thecitizen.com/archive/main/archive-040317/weekend/w-07.html |title=Local student to judge Peabodys |publisher=TheCitizen |date=2004-03-17 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref> Each committee is charged with screening or listening to a small number of entries and delivering written recommendations to the Peabody Board, a ~17-member panel of scholars, critics and media-industry professionals.<ref name="thecitizen"/> Board members discuss recommended entries as well as their own selections at intensive preliminary meetings in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The Board convenes at the Peabody Offices on the [[University of Georgia]] campus in late March for final screenings and deliberations. Each entrant is judged on its own merit, and only unanimously selected programs receive Peabodys.<ref name="variety"/> There is no set number of Peabodys; the all-time record for Peabody recipients in a single year is 46 Awards in 2013.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/75244/peabody-hands-out-a-record-46-awards "Peabody Hands Out A Record 46 Awards,"] from TVNewsCheck, 4/2/2014</ref>

==Award announcements and ceremonies==
Each spring, Peabody organizers announce award recipients for work covering the previous year.  Traditionally, the winners' announcements have been made via a simple press release and/or a press conference.  In recent years, however, organizers have also taken to television to reveal some Peabody recipients in an effort to expand the public's awareness of the awards.  An April 2014 segment of ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' included an announcement of 2013 Peabody winners.<ref name=73rd>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/another-great-article3 "Ira Glass Will Host 73rd Annual Peabody Awards,"] from the Peabody Awards website (accessed 4/16/2015)</ref>  In April 2015, the 2014 Peabodys were revealed over an 8-day period, with the entertainment-based recipients revealed on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=74th>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/74th-annual-peabody-award-winners Announcement of early 74th Peabody Award winners] from PeabodyAwards.com (accessed 4/15/2015)</ref>

The formal presentations of the Peabody Awards are traditionally held in late May or early June, and have been usually held at a luncheon in [[New York City]].  The ceremony for 2014 recipients will be held for the first time at night in a May 31, 2015 award ceremony to be hosted by [[Fred Armisen]].<ref name=74th/>  Several famous names have served as Peabody ceremony hosts over the years, among them [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Lesley Stahl]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Larry King]],<ref name="dailycourier"/><ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/07/larry-king-hosting-peabod_n_832306.html |title=Larry King Hosting Peabody Awards |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref> and [[Ira Glass]].<ref name=73rd/>  Since 2014, the Peabody ceremonies have aired on a tape-delayed basis by the cable/satellite channel [[Pivot (TV channel)|Pivot]],<ref>[http://variety.com/2014/tv/awards/participant-medias-pivot-to-broadcast-peabody-awards-through-2016-1201136537/ "Participant Media’s Pivot to Broadcast Peabody Awards Through 2016,"] from ''Variety'', 3/17/2014</ref> who will carry the 74th ceremonies on June 21, 2015.<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/04/13/special-the-74th-annual-peabody-awards-on-pivot-to-premiere-sunday-june-21/388356/ Special 'The 74th Annual Peabody Awards on Pivot' to Premiere Sunday, June 21]</ref>

==Peabody Awards Archive==
The Peabody Awards Collection is the flagship of The Walter J. Brown Media Archive & Peabody Awards Collection. The archives are housed in the [[Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies]] near the north campus of [[The University of Georgia]]. The archives mission is to preserve, protect, and provide access to the moving image and sound materials that reflect the collective memory of broadcasting and the history of the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and its people. The collection contains nearly every entry for the first major broadcast award given in the [[United States]]. Entries begin in 1940 for radio and 1948 for television, and at least 1,000 new entries are received every year—programs created by local, national, and international producers. The collection provides a cultural cross-section of television from its infancy to the present day, featuring news, documentary, entertainment, educational, and children's programming. Once judging is complete all the entries are moved to the Main Library for in-depth cataloging, access, and long-term preservation.<ref>[http://www.libs.uga.edu/media/about/history.html UGA Libraries]</ref>
