==Personal life and family==
Romano was born in [[Queens, New York]], the son of Lucie (Fortini), a piano teacher, and Albert Romano (November 7, 1925 – March 11, 2010), a real estate agent and engineer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/0/Ray-Romano.html|title=Ray Romano Biography (1957-)|work=filmreference.com|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="Albert Romano Obituary">{{cite web|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Albert-A.-Romano-88100334|title=Albert Romano Obituary| publisher=tributes.com| date= 2010-03-12|accessdate=2015-03-28}}</ref> He is of seven-eighths [[Italian American|Italian]], and one-eighth [[French American|French]] descent, and grew up in the [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] neighborhood of Queens.<ref>Strickland, Carol.

They have four children: daughter, Alexandra (born in 1990), and sons: twins Matthew and Gregory (born in 1993), and Joseph Raymond (born in 1998).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Romano's on-screen daughter for ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' was named after his real-life daughter. Also, in the series pilot, Ray and Debra's twin boys were named Gregory and Matthew, after Romano's real-life twin sons, but Romano felt it was inconvenient to have all his TV children have the same names as his real children, and changed the twins' names to Jeffrey and Michael on screen. He also said his brother was not pleased with Ray Barone's TV brother.<ref name=Heldenfels>{{cite news|url=http://www.ohio.com/the330entertainment/heldenfels/mailbag-unforgettable-to-return-for-third-season-in-summer-2014-1.433679|title=Mailbag: ‘Unforgettable’ to return for third season in summer 2014|last=Heldenfels|first=Rich|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|date=2 October 2013|access-date=1 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015035459/http://www.ohio.com/the330entertainment/heldenfels/mailbag-unforgettable-to-return-for-third-season-in-summer-2014-1.433679|archivedate=15 October 2013}}</ref>

Romano's family has made various appearances in the show. Romano's real-life daughter Alexandra "Ally" Romano made several appearances on ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' as Molly, the best friend of his on-screen daughter, Ally, and the daughter of Ray Barone's nemesis, Peggy the Cookie Lady. Romano's father, Albert Romano, has made various appearances as "Albert", one of Frank Barone's lodge buddies in various episodes such as "Debra at the Lodge", and "Boys' Therapy". Romano's brother, Richard Romano, has appeared in the episodes "Golf For It", "Just a Formality" and "The Toaster".

In February 2012, Romano revealed that his wife, Anna, had successfully battled stage one breast cancer in 2010. Romano told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine that "the reason we're going public is to share our experience, yeah, but to have an effect. Our goal is to help people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.people.com/bb/newsitem.rbml?item=20568358&feed=2%5Burl%3DdlUrl%5D&dlUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Fmediarss%2Fmobile%2Farticle%2F0%252C%252C20568358%252C00.xml |title=Ray Romano: My Wife Beat Breast Cancer |publisher=People |date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
Ray attended [[Primary education|elementary]] and [[middle school]] at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring from [[Archbishop Molloy High School]], Romano graduated from [[Hillcrest High School (New York City)|Hillcrest High School]] in 1975.<ref name="Yahoo Movies - Ray Romano">{{Cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800257587/bio|title=Yahoo Movies - Ray Romano|accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> He was in the same high school class as [[Fran Drescher]] and later appeared on Drescher's sitcom, ''[[The Nanny]]'', as Ray Barone, where it was revealed that Ray and Drescher's character, Fran Fine, were high school classmates. Before getting into show business, Romano briefly attended [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]], in [[Flushing, New York]], where he studied accounting. Romano quit after gaining only 15 credits in three years, but he would later return.{{Fact|date=April 2015}}

Ray's early comedy career started when he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989. His career included many outlets, such as [[Comedy Central]], where he had been a recurring guest voice on the show ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]''. He also was a contestant on ''[[Star Search]]'' in the stand-up comedy category.  He originally was cast to play Joe (originally named Rick) on the American television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[NewsRadio]]'', but was fired and replaced by [[Joe Rogan]]. He then appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' doing his stand up routine which formed his ties with [[CBS]]. Shortly thereafter, he became the star of his own show, ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' on [[CBS]], that featured a cast and format more suitable to Romano's brand of humor. His work on the series earned him six [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations, winning in 2002, as well as five [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations and two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.

Ray and his comedian friend, [[Kevin James]], starred in the salesman comedy, ''[[Grilled (film)|Grilled]]'', as two guys of the same profession who are both very desperate to land a big sale.

Romano was featured on a 2000 episode of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', on which he won US$125,000 for the [[NYPD]]'s [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|D.A.R.E.]] Unit.

In 2001, Romano was named one of [[E!]]'s top twenty entertainers of the year. That same year he was featured with his brother (a teacher at a school in Long Island) on a New York Police Department recruiting poster. In 2004 he became the highest-paid television actor in history for his role of Raymond on [[CBS]]'s ''Everybody Loves Raymond''. It was later revealed on E! that he had broken another record by his show having the highest revenue at US$3.9 billion.

On December 13, 2003, Romano was featured as a special guest star, sending a birthday card to [[Bob Barker]] in his eightieth-birthday bash on the twenty-seventh "Million Dollar Spectacular" special of the long-running daytime CBS series ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.

Romano was the subject of the documentary film, ''[[95 Miles to Go]]''. The film documents Romano's road-trip for a series of rides across the south of the United States. The film was released in theaters on April 7, 2010, by [[ThinkFilm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428196/|title=95 Miles to Go|author=gavin6942|date=16 October 2004|work=IMDb|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref> In August 2006 Romano was interviewed in front of a live audience at [[UCLA]] by fellow stand-up veteran, [[David Steinberg]], for an episode of ''[[Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg]]''. The program first aired on the [[TV Land]] network in March 2007.

Romano returned to television with a new dramedy for [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] in 2008, ''[[Men of a Certain Age]]'', which he co-created with former ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' writer, [[Mike Royce]]. It co-starred [[Scott Bakula]] and [[Andre Braugher]].

Romano made an appearance in the seventh season of [[NBC]] show ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' as Merv Bronte, an anxious job applicant interviewing for the job left vacant by [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]].

Romano made an appearance in the third season premiere of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'' as Nicky, a friend of Mike, who ruined his and Frankie's honeymoon.

Ray joined the cast of ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'' beginning September 11, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|first= Lynette|last= Rice|title='Parenthood' scoop: Ray Romano to guest star|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/06/19/parenthood-scoop-ray-romano-to-guest-star/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|url=http://tvline.com/2013/06/20/parenthood-season-5-ray-romano-returns-as-hank/|title=''Parenthood'': Ray Romano Books Season 5 Encore|work=[[TVLine]]|date=June 20, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> He became a semi-regular, playing photographer Hank Rizzoli, who hired and later had a romantic relationship with [[Sarah Braverman]] and developed a friendship with her nephew who has [[Asperger syndrome]].
