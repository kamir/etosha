C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in [[Mexico]].  C.K.'s paternal uncle Dr. Francisco Székely is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000–2003).<ref name=Uncle-pdf>{{cite web|title=Biography: Dr. Francisco Székely|url=http://www.ecologic.eu/download/dinner_dialogue/2004/cv_Szekely.pdf|work=Ecologic Institute|accessdate=January 16, 2014|format=PDF|year=2004}}</ref>

=== Early years ===
Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], C.K. lived there only until age 1, when his family moved to [[Mexico City]],<ref name=RollingStone-AccidentalWhite-2013 /> where he lived until he was 7.<ref name="Copley-Knutzen-2007"/> C.K.'s first language was Spanish; it was not until after the move to the U.S. that he began to learn English.<ref name=Playboy-20Q-2011>{{cite web|last1=Buhrmester|first1=Jason|title=20Q: Louis C.K.|url=http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/20q-louis-c-k|website=[[Playboy Magazine|Playboy]]|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=31 May 2011}}</ref> He has since mostly forgotten his Spanish.<ref name="youtube.com"/>

On moving from Mexico to suburban [[Boston]], C.K. wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing [[Bill Cosby]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[George Carlin]] as some of his influences.<ref name="NYPost-HotSeat-2007"/> When he was 10, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much. C.K. and his three sisters were raised by their single mother in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].<ref name="NYObserver-SaveSitcom-2005">{{cite news|last=Hagan|first=Joe|title=Can HBO Save the Sitcom? Louis CK Says Yes|url=http://observer.com/2005/04/can-hbo-save-the-sitcom-louis-ck-says-yes/|accessdate=August 5, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|year=2005}}</ref> The fact that his mother had only "bad" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. In April 2005, he told ''[[The Observer]]'': "I remember thinking in fifth grade, 'I have to get inside that box and make this shit better'. Because she deserves this. It made me mad that the shows were so bad."<ref name=NYObserver-SaveSitcom-2005/>

C.K.'s mother raised her children as Catholic, wanting them to have a religious framework and understanding, and they attended after-school Catholic class until they completed communion.<ref name=NPR-FreshAir-Hiatus-2014 /> According to a 2011 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article:

<blockquote>C.K. was a depressive kid. In junior high he took to drugs, "closing myself off from feelings," he says. "Eighth and ninth grade were two solid years of dropping acid, snorting coke when somebody had it, Quaaludes, an alarming amount of pot, mescaline, drinking. By the time I got to high school, I was a recovered drug addict." C.K. ran for a time with a bad crowd, breaking into cars and snatching valuables within.<ref name=RStone-Feature-2011 /></blockquote>

The "In The Woods" pair of episodes in his TV series ''[[Louie (season 4)#Episodes|Louie]]'' are a loose dramatization of this period of his youth.

After graduating from [[Newton North High School]], C.K. worked as an auto mechanic and at a public access TV cable station in Boston, while "summoning the courage to try stand-up".<ref name="Copley-Knutzen-2007"/> Among other jobs he worked, C.K. "cleaned pools, fixed cars and spent a year as a [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] cook; he brought home KFC turkey dinners two Thanksgivings in a row. Subsequently, he clerked at a video store."<ref name=RStone-Feature-2011 /> According to C.K., working in public access TV gave him the tools and technical knowledge to make his short films and later his television shows. "Learning is my favorite thing," he said.<ref name=Slate-Hulu-CharlieRose-2014 />

== Career ==

=== Stand-up ===
His first attempt at stand-up was in 1984 at an [[open-mic]] night at a [[comedy club]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], during the apex of the comedy boom. He was given five minutes of time, but had only two minutes of material.<ref name=LouisCK-bio-archive-2008>{{cite web|last=CK|first=Louis|title=Louis C.K.'s Bio|url=http://www.louisck.net/bio.html|work=Louis C.K.|accessdate=23 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413233950/http://www.louisck.net/bio.html|archivedate=13 April 2008}}</ref> He was so discouraged by the experience that he did not perform again for two years.<ref name="About.com-Bio">{{cite web|last=Bromley|first=Patrick |title=Louis CK – Biography |url=http://comedians.about.com/od/comediansal/p/louisck.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=12 October 2010}}</ref> He and [[Marc Maron]] later reminisced about their early careers and friendship on Maron's ''[[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF Podcast]]''.<ref name=NYMag-One-Man-2011>Nussbaum, Emily, [http://nymag.com/arts/tv/upfronts/2011/louis-ck-2011-5/index1.html "One-Man Show: No, really.

As Boston's comedy scene grew, C.K. gradually achieved success, performing alongside acts such as [[Denis Leary]] and [[Lenny Clarke]], and eventually he moved up to paid gigs, opening for [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and hosting comedy clubs<ref name="Copley-Knutzen-2007"/> until he moved to [[Manhattan]] in 1989.<ref name="LouisCK-bio-archive-2008"/> He performed his act on many televised programs, including ''Evening at the Improv'' and ''[[Star Search]]''. In 1993, he unsuccessfully auditioned for [[Saturday Night Live]], and most of the comedy clubs in New York City closed.<ref name=HReporter-NYCCoverStory-2015 /> In 1996 [[HBO]] released his first half-hour comedy special.<ref name=LouisCK-bio-archive-2008 />

[[File:Louis CK Kuwait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Louis C.K. performing in [[Kuwait]], December 2008]]
C.K. has performed his stand-up frequently on shows such as ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. In August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series ''[[One Night Stand (US TV series)|One Night Stand]]''.

Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian [[George Carlin]], who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year,<ref name=MetroComedy-2011>{{cite web|title=Louis C.K. "I’m Doing Exactly What He Taught Me To Do"|url=http://www.metrocomedy.com/2011/09/louis-c-k-im-doing-exactly-what-he-taught-me-to-do/|work=Metro Comedy|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=6 September 2011}}</ref> C.K. launched his first hour-long special, ''Shameless'', in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, ''[[Chewed Up]]'', which premiered on [[Showtime Network]] on October 4, 2008, and went on to be nominated for an [[Emmy]] for "Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Special". C.K. has said that "failure is the road to becoming a great comedian."<ref name=Slate-Hulu-CharlieRose-2014>{{cite web|last=Haglund|first=David|title=Watch Louis C.K.

On April 18, 2009, C.K. recorded a concert film titled ''[[Hilarious (film)|Hilarious]]''. Unlike his previous specials—which had all been produced for television networks—''Hilarious'' was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] and [[Comedy Central]] after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011.<ref name=Pitchfork-Interview-2011>{{cite web|last=Deusner|first=Stephen M.|title=Interviews: Louis C.K.|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7926-louis-ck/|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc.|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=20 June 2011}}</ref> It is the first stand-up comedy film to be accepted into Sundance.<ref name=AVClub-interview-2010>{{cite web|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/louis-ck,42621/ |title=Louis C.K.|work=[[The A.V.

In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, "well, there goes my act." He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realize "I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling."<ref name="NPR-FreshAir-Post-Divorce-2010" /> One element in his preparation for stand-up was training in the [[boxing]] gym, including with [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] fighter [[Micky Ward]], trying to "learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating."<ref name="NPR-FreshAir-Post-Divorce-2010" />

On December 10, 2011, C.K. released his fourth full-length special, ''[[Live at the Beacon Theater]]''. Like ''Hilarious'', it was produced independently and directed by C.K. However, unlike his earlier work, it was distributed digitally on the comedian's website, foregoing both physical and broadcast media. C.K. released the special for $5.00 and without [[digital rights management|DRM]], hoping that these factors and the direct relationship between the artist and consumer would effectively deter piracy.<ref name=NPR-FreshAir-Louie-Love-Loss-2011>{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Terry|title=Louis C.K.

The success of the special prompted other comedians, including [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Joe Rogan]], and [[Aziz Ansari]], to release their own specials with a similar business model.<ref name=Forbes-RedditAMA-2012>{{cite news|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|title=Inside the Reddit AMA: The Interview Revolution That Has Everyone Talking |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/05/01/inside-the-reddit-ama-the-interview-revolution-that-has-everyone-talking/|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=1 May 2012}}</ref> On May 11, 2012, C.K. additionally made two audio-only downloads available for $5.00 each: ''[[Word: Live at Carnegie Hall|WORD&nbsp;– Live at Carnegie Hall]]'' (and the audio version of his first [[HBO]] stand-up special, ''Shameless''), as well as an audio-only version of ''[[Live at the Beacon Theater]]''.<ref name=LouisCK-PayPal-Statement-2011 />

C.K.'s fifth one-hour special, ''Oh My God'', was recorded at the [[Celebrity Theatre]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and premiered on HBO April 13, 2013.<ref name=Esquire-AmPreacher-2013>{{cite web|last=Marche|first=Stephen|title=Louis C.K.

C.K. released his sixth one hour special ''Live at The Comedy Store'' recorded, unlike his past few specials, at a club, [[The Comedy Store]] in [[West Hollywood]]. C.K. mentioned the material was intended to be an exercise in creating an act which harkened back to his early days of working in comedy clubs.<ref name=Vulture-ComedyStore-2015>{{cite news|last1=Zoller Seitz|first1=Matt|title=‘Louis C.K.

C.K. is the first comedian to sell out [[Madison Square Garden]] three times in a single tour.<ref name=HReporter-NYCCoverStory-2015 />

=== Writing ===

In the ''[[Louie (TV series)|Louie]]'' episode "Barney / Never", [[Gregg Hughs|Opie]], [[Anthony Cumia|Anthony]], and Norton (along with comedian [[Amy Schumer]]) play the on-air talent of a stereotypical wacky morning radio program into which C.K.'s character is calling to promote a nearby gig.

During an interview with [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] on ''[[The Opie & Anthony Show]]'', C.K. repeatedly asked Rumsfeld whether he is in fact a [[reptilians|reptilian]] space alien who "eats Mexican babies".<ref name=HuffPo-RumsfeldLizard-2011>{{cite news|last=McGlynn|first=Katia|title=Louis C.K.

==== Ticketing innovation ====
C.K. innovated direct-to-consumer distribution of his and others' work, selling tickets via his website in [[DRM-free]] format. In this way C.K. sold tickets for his stand-up tour, circumventing large [[Primary ticket outlet|ticket outlets]] (e.g., [[Ticketmaster]]), creatively bypassing their overhead and the venues they control.<ref name=NYT-Joke-2013 />  C.K. has said the ticket outlets create barriers to consumers, whereas direct distribution is easy &mdash; and has effectively "closed the gap between how easy it was to steal it [versus] how easy it was to buy it."<ref name=Slate-Hulu-CharlieRose-2014 />
