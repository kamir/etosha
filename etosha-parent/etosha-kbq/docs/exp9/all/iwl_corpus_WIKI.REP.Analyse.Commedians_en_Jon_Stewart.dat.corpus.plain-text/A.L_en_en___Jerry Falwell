==Personal life==
{{Southern Baptists}}
Falwell and twin brother Gene were born in the Fairview Heights region of [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], the sons of Helen Virginia (Beasley) and Carey Hezekiah Falwell.<ref name=NYT051507/><ref>http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Falwell_Jerry_1933-2007</ref><ref>https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XRFD-YBG</ref> His father was an entrepreneur and one-time [[Rum-runner|bootlegger]] who was [[agnostic]].<ref name=NYT051507/> His grandfather was a staunch [[atheism|atheist]].<ref name=NYT051507/> Jerry Falwell married the former Macel Pate on April 12, 1958. The couple had two sons and a daughter ([[Jerry Falwell, Jr.]], a lawyer and current chancellor of Liberty University; [[Jonathan Falwell]], an ordained minister who serves as the senior pastor at Thomas Road Baptist Church; and Jeannie, a surgeon).

He graduated from Brookville High School in Lynchburg, Va., and from [[Baptist Bible College (Springfield, Missouri)|Baptist Bible College]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]] in 1956. This Bible college was unaccredited until 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&Action=ShowBasic&instid=2797  |title= Higher Learning Commission:Baptist Bible College|accessdate=January 6, 2009 |date=April 1, 2008  |publisher=Higher Learning Commission}}</ref> Falwell was later awarded three honorary doctoral degrees.

===Thomas Road Baptist Church===
{{Main|Thomas Road Baptist Church}}
In 1956, at age 22, Falwell founded the [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]] in Lynchburg,  where he served as pastor. The Church went on to become a [[megachurch]], and is now run by Jerry Falwell's son [[Jonathan Falwell]], who serves in the same capacity as his father. The original church was located at 701 Thomas Road.

===Liberty Christian Academy===
{{Main|Liberty Christian Academy}}
During the 1950s and 1960s, Falwell spoke and campaigned against the [[Civil and political rights|U.S. civil rights]] [[activist]] [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[racial desegregation]] of public school systems by the U.S. federal government.  Liberty Christian Academy (LCA, founded as Lynchburg Christian Academy) is a Christian school in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], which was described in 1966 by the Lynchburg News as "a private school for white students."

The Lynchburg Christian Academy later opened in 1967 by Falwell as a [[segregation academy]] and as a ministry of [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]].<ref>http://www.lcabulldogs.com/index.cfm?PID=19523</ref><ref name="Dowland2007">{{cite book|author=Seth Dowland|title=Defending Manhood: Gender, Social Order and the Rise of the Christian Right in the South, 1965-1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u3aJmNF9AKQC&pg=PA23|accessdate=6 September 2012|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-71783-6|page=23}}</ref><ref>http://www.thenation.com/article/agent-intolerance# "Agent of Intolerance".

===Liberty University===
{{Main|Liberty University}}
In 1971, Jerry Falwell founded Liberty University, the largest private, nonprofit university in the nation, the largest university in Virginia, and the largest Christian university in the world.<ref name="Liberty University">{{cite web |title= Liberty University |url=http://www.liberty.edu/aboutliberty/}}</ref> Liberty University offers over 350 accredited programs of study,<ref name="Liberty University"/> with approximately 13,000 residential students and 90,000 online.<ref>{{cite web |title= Liberty University |url=http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=14588}}</ref>

===Moral Majority===
{{Main|Moral Majority}}

====Green v. Connally, 1971====
In 1971, before the Roe v. Wade decision riveted America, the Supreme Court ruled in [[Coit v. Green|Green v. Connally]] to revoke the tax-exempt status of racially discriminatory private schools. Green v. Connally, produced a ruling that any institution that practiced segregation was not, by definition, a charitable institution and, therefore, no longer qualified for tax-exempt standing, holding: "Using federal tax funds to finance private schools for purposes of segregation of students in segregation academies violates the IRS public tax fund rules, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because discrimination coupled with segregation is inherently unequal. District of Columbia district court affirmed."

====IRS intervention, 1975====
By 1975, the Internal Revenue Service moved to revoke the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University, which forbade interracial dating (blacks were denied entry until 1971). The decisions infuriated Falwell. "In some states it's easier to open a massage parlor than to open a Christian school," Falwell complained.<ref>http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785 "Book Excerpt: 'Thy Kingdom Come'. Randall Balmer.June 22, 2006</ref>

[[Heritage Foundation]] co-founder [[Paul Weyrich]] stated that Falwell launched the [[Moral Majority]] political action committee during 1979 to aid the [[Catholic]] public protest against legal abortion in the United States in response to [[U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter's]] "intervention against Christian schools" [the IRS intervention began during the Ford Administration] by "...trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called ''[[de facto]]'' segregation".<ref>''Republican Gomorrah: Inside The Movement That Shattered The Party''. p. 25. Nation Books, 2009.</ref>

The Moral Majority became one of the largest political lobby groups for evangelical Christians in the United States during the 1980s.<ref name=MSNBC>{{cite news |title=Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell dies|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18679412/M |publisher=MSNBC |date=May 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> The Moral Majority was promoted as being "pro-life", "pro-traditional family", "pro-moral" and "pro-American"<ref>Falwell: An Autobiography, The Inside Story, Liberty House Publishers, Lynchburg, 1997 Pg. 388</ref> and was credited with delivering two thirds of the white, evangelical Christian vote to [[Ronald Reagan]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]].<ref name="worldscollide">{{cite news|first=Randall E.|last=King|title= When worlds collide: politics, religion, and media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade.

While it was not the first time that ...</ref> According to [[Jimmy Carter]], "that autumn [1980] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian."<ref>{{Cite book | page = 469 | last = Carter | first = Jimmy | title = White House Diary | year = 2010 | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York, N.Y }}</ref> During his time as head of the Moral Majority, Falwell consistently pushed for Republican candidates and for conservative politics. This led [[Billy Graham]] to criticize him for "sermonizing" about political issues that lacked a moral element, before adding, "We did not always agree on everything, but I knew him to be a man of God. His accomplishments went beyond most clergy of his generation." .<ref name=MSNBC/>

==Social and political views==

===Families===
Falwell strongly advocated beliefs and practices he believed were taught by the Bible.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fundamentalist Phenomenon |last=Falwell |first=Jerry |year=1986 |publisher=Baker Publishing Group |author2=Hindson, Edward E. |isbn=0-8010-2958-9}}</ref> The church, Falwell asserted, was the cornerstone of a successful family. Not only was it a place for spiritual learning and guidance, but also a gathering place for fellowship and socializing with like minded individuals. Often he built conversations he had with parishioners after the worship service into focused speeches or organized goals he would then present to a larger audience via his various media outlets.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The Vietnam War===
Falwell found the Vietnam war problematic because he felt it was being fought with "limited political objectives," when it should have been an all out war against the North.<ref>Falwell, ''Listen, America!'', 85.</ref> In general, Falwell held that the president "as a minister of God" has the right to use arms to "bring wrath upon those who would do evil."<ref>Falwell, ''Listen, America!'', 98.</ref>

===Civil rights===
On his evangelist program ''[[The Old-Time Gospel Hour]]'' in the mid 1960s, Falwell regularly featured [[racial segregation|segregation]]ist politicians like [[Lester Maddox]] and [[George Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=522 |title=Holy War |publisher=SPLCenter.org |date=2003-06-26 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>  About [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]] he said: "I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|Mr. James Farmer]], and others, who are known to have left wing associations."<ref>{{cite book | last = Washington | first = James M. | title = A Testament of Hope: the essential writings of Martin Luther King | publisher = Harper Collins | location = San Francisco | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-06-064691-8 }}</ref>

In speaking of the ''[[Brown vs. Board of Education]]'' ruling, he said, in 1958:

{{Quote|If [[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren]] and his associates had known God's word and had desired to do the Lord's will, I am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never had been made. The facilities should be separate. When God has drawn a line of distinction, we should not attempt to cross that line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070528/blumenthal |title=May 28, 2007 |publisher=The Nation |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>}}

In 1977, Falwell supported [[Anita Bryant]]'s campaign, which was called by its proponents "Save Our Children", to overturn an ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]] prohibiting [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]], and he supported a similar movement in California.<ref name = NYT051507/>

Twenty-eight years later, in an appearance on [[MSNBC]] television, Falwell said he was not troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, [[John G. Roberts]] (whose appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate) had done volunteer legal work for homosexual rights activists on the case of ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''.  Falwell told MSNBC's [[Tucker Carlson]] that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people.  "I may not agree with the lifestyle, but that has nothing to do with the civil rights of that part of our constituency," Falwell said.  When Carlson countered that conservatives "are always arguing against 'special rights' for gays," Falwell said that equal access to housing, civil marriage, and employment are basic rights, not special rights. "Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value.  It's an American value that I would think that we pretty much all agree on."<ref>Eartha Jane Melzer, Falwell hints support for some homosexual rights, ''The Washington Blade'', August 26, 2005.</ref>

===Israel and Jews===
Falwell's staunch pro-[[Israel]] stand, sometimes referred to as "[[Christian Zionism]]", drew the strong support of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and its leader [[Abraham Foxman]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Mary Jayne  |last=McKay |title=Zion's Christian Soldiers |curly= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/03/60minutes/main524268.shtml  |publisher=CBS News  |date=June 8, 2003 |accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref> However, they condemned what they perceived as intolerance towards Muslims in Falwell's public statements. They also criticized him for remarking that "Jews can make more money accidentally than you can on purpose."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/DiRaB_41/4168_41.htm |title=ADL Condemns Falwell's Anti-Muslim Remarks; Urges Him to Apologize |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref name="jews">{{cite web|url=http://maxblumenthal.com/2009/09/irving-kristols-alliance-with-anti-semites/|title=Irving Kristol's Alliance With Anti-Semites|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref> In his book, "Listen, America!", Falwell referred to the Jewish people as "spiritually blind and desperately in need of their Messiah and Savior."<ref name=listenamerica>{{cite book|last=Falwell|first=Jerry|title=Listen, America!|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Company, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-385-15897-1|page=113}}</ref>

One unusual link between Falwell and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]] [[Arnold Resnicoff]], a Navy chaplain, was created when President [[Ronald Reagan]] surprised the participants at Falwell's "Baptist Fundamentalism '84" convention in Washington, D.C., by choosing to read [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39775 Resnicoff's on-site report] of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] as his keynote address.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39775 |title=Speech, President Ronald Reagan, Baptist Fundamentalism '84 Convention, Washington, D.C |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=1984-04-13 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> When Resnicoff later served as Special Assistant for Values and Vision for the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, he would meet with Falwell to discuss issues linked to religious rights in the military, including the role and responsibilities of U.S. military chaplains. Resnicoff reported that Falwell supported the idea of using the Biblical verse that teaches that "God hears the words of our mouths and the meditations of our heart" as a basis for allowing Christian chaplains to offer "inclusive" prayers, because they could offer denominational words, such as "In Jesus's name," silently, as a "meditation of the heart."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/print.asp?ArticleID=7131&SectionID=4&SubSectionID=4 |title="Falwell Left Jews with Mixed Feelings," Washington Jewish Week, May 16, 2007 |publisher=Washingtonjewishweek.com |date=2007-05-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110611192034/http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/print.asp?ArticleID=7131&SectionID=4&SubSectionID=4|archivedate=11 June 2011|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

===Education===
Falwell repeatedly denounced certain teachings in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s and [[secular education]] in general, calling them breeding grounds for [[atheism]], [[secularism]], and [[humanism]], which he claimed to be in contradiction with Christian [[morality]]. He advocated that the United States change its public education system by implementing a [[school voucher]] system which would allow parents to send their children to either public or private schools. Jerry Falwell wrote in ''America Can Be Saved'' that "I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/western/bldef_falwelljerry.htm |title=Biography: Falwell, Jerry |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=1982-11-21 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

Falwell supported President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|Faith Based Initiative]], but had strong reservations concerning where the funding would go and the restrictions placed on churches. "My problem is where it might go under his successors.... I would not want to put any of the Jerry Falwell Ministries in a position where we might be subservient to a future [[Bill Clinton]], God forbid.... It also concerns me that once the [[pork barrel]] is filled, suddenly the [[Church of Scientology]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah Witnesses]] ''{{sic}}'', the various and many denominations and religious groups—and I don't say those words in a pejorative way—begin applying for money—and I don't see how any can be turned down because of their radical and unpopular views. I don't know where that would take us."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/70/story_7040_1.html |title=Beliefnet interviews Rev. Jerry Falwell&nbsp;– |publisher=Beliefnet.com |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

===Apartheid===
In the 1980s Jerry Falwell was critical of sanctions against the [[apartheid]] regime of South Africa. He claimed that sanctions would result in what, he felt, would be a worse situation, such as a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed revolution. He drew the ire of many when he called [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner and [[Anglican]] Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] a phony "as far as representing the black people of South Africa".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959695,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: An Unholy Uproar | date=September 2, 1985 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> He later apologized for that remark and claimed that he had misspoken.<ref>{{cite news|author=Pear, Robert|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A15FB3D5F0C728EDDA10894DD484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fF%2fFalwell%2c%20Jerry |title=Falwell Denounces Tutu As A 'Phony' |location=South Africa, Republic Of |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1985-08-21 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> He also urged his followers to buy up gold [[Krugerrand]]s and push U.S. "reinvestment" in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news |first=RICHARD N. |last=OSTLING |authorlink=Richard Ostling |title= Jerry Falwell's Crusade|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959697,00.html |work= |publisher=Time Magazine |date=September 2, 1985 |accessdate=May 17, 2007 }}</ref>

===''Clinton Chronicles''===
{{Main|The Clinton Chronicles}}
In 1994, Falwell promoted and distributed the video documentary ''The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton''. The video purported to connect [[Bill Clinton]] to a murder conspiracy involving [[Vincent Foster]], [[Jim McDougal|James McDougall]], [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]], and a [[cocaine]]-[[smuggling]] operation. The theory was discredited, but nonetheless sold more than 150,000 copies.<ref name="falwell">[http://www.salon.com/1998/03/11/cov_11news/ The Falwell connection] by [[Murray Waas]] Salon.com</ref>

Funding for the film was provided by "Citizens for Honest Government", to which Jerry Falwell paid $200,000 in 1994 and 1995.<ref name="falwell"/> In 1995 Citizens for Honest Government interviewed two [[Arkansas State Police|Arkansas state troopers]], Roger Perry and [[Larry Patterson]], regarding the murder conspiracy about Vincent Foster. Perry and Patterson also gave information regarding the allegations in the [[Paula Jones]] [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|affair]].<ref name="falwell"/>

Falwell's [[infomercial]] for the 80-minute tape included footage of Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist who claimed to be afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his illegalities. It was subsequently revealed, however, that the silhouetted journalist was, in fact, Patrick Matrisciana, the producer of the video and president of Citizens for Honest Government.<ref name="falwell"/> "Obviously, I'm not an investigative reporter", Matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist [[Murray Waas]].<ref name="falwell"/> Later, Falwell seemed to back away from personally trusting the video. In an interview for the 2005 documentary ''[[The Hunting of the President]]'', Falwell admitted, "to this day I do not know the accuracy of the claims made in ''The Clinton Chronicles''."<ref>''[[The Hunting of the President]]'' (DVD) 2005</ref>

===Views on homosexuality===
Falwell condemned homosexuality as forbidden by the Bible. Gay rights groups called Falwell an "agent of intolerance" and "the founder of the anti-gay industry" for statements he has made and for campaigning against [[LGBT social movements]].<ref name=NYT051507/><ref name="intolerance"/> However, it had been preached against by right-wing Christians in the United States and elsewhere for some years before Falwell made any notable public comment on the matter. Falwell supported [[Anita Bryant]]'s 1977 "Save Our Children" campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] and a similar movement in California.<ref name=NYT051507>Applebome, Peter (May 15, 2007).

After comedienne and actress [[Ellen DeGeneres]] came out as a lesbian, Falwell referred to her in a sermon as "Ellen DeGenerate". DeGeneres mocked him, saying, "Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I've been getting that since the fourth grade. I guess I'm happy I could give him work."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986189,00.html |title=HE CALLED ME ELLEN DEGENERATE? |accessdate=November 25, 2008 | last=Handy | first=Bruce | work=Time | date=April 14, 1997}}</ref>

At the same time, Falwell's legacy regarding homosexuality is complicated by his support for LGBT civil rights (see "civil rights" section above), as well as his efforts at reconciliation with the LGBT community in later years.  In October 1999 Falwell hosted a meeting of 200 evangelicals with 200 homosexuals at Thomas Road Baptist Church for an "Anti-Violence Forum", during which he acknowledged that some American evangelicals' comments about homosexuality entered the realm of hate speech that could incite violence.<ref>Niebuhr, Gustav (October 23, 1999). [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/23/us/religion-journal-falwell-finds-an-accord-with-gay-rights-backer.html "Religion Journal; Falwell Finds an Accord With Gay Rights Backer"]. ''The New York Times''.</ref> At the forum, Falwell told homosexuals in attendance, "I don't agree with your lifestyle, I will never agree with your lifestyle, but I love you" and added, "Anything that leaves the impression that we hate the sinner, we want to change that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/falwell/index.html |title=The odd couple&nbsp;— Gays and Lesbians |publisher=Salon.com |date=1999-10-25 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> He later commented to ''New York Times'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] that "admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian community. We've said 'go somewhere else, we don't need you here [at] our churches.'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/opinion/journal-has-jerry-falwell-seen-the-light.html?scp=2&sq=jerry%20falwell%20AND%20homosexual&st=nyt&pagewanted=1 |title=Has Jerry Falwell Seen the Light?

===''Teletubbies''===
In February 1999, an unsigned article that media outlets attributed to Falwell was published in the ''National Liberty Journal''&nbsp;– a promotional publication of the university he founded&nbsp;– claimed that the purple [[Teletubbies|Teletubby]] named Tinky Winky was intended as a gay [[role model]]. An article published in 1998 by [[Salon.com]] had noted Tinky Winky's status as a gay icon.<ref name=Tubbythump>{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/media/1998/04/03media.html | title='Tubbythumping ' | last=Millman | first=Joyce |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110613062013/http://www.salon.com/media/1998/04/03media.html|archivedate=13 June 2011|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>[http://www.liberty.edu/libertyjournal/index.cfm?PID=15758&artid=97 Arizona supporter funds largest-ever gift annuity to LU] (February 27, 2008) By Mitzi Bible&nbsp;– Liberty Journal</ref> In response, Steve Rice, spokesperson for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment, which licenses the ''Teletubbies'' in the United States, said, "I really find it absurd and kind of offensive."<ref name=Tinky>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/276677.stm | title='Gay Tinky Winky bad for children' | accessdate=May 18, 2007  | work=BBC News | date=February 15, 1999}}</ref><ref name=Winky>{{cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=auX3.SI9QH2M | title = Jerry Falwell, Evangelist, Political Activist, Dies | accessdate=May 18, 2007 | last=Burke | first=Heather | work=Bloomberg | date=May 15, 2007}}</ref> The immensely popular UK show was aimed at pre-school children, but the article stated "he is purple&nbsp;– the [[gay pride]] color; and his antenna is shaped like a [[triangle]]&nbsp;– the gay-pride symbol". Apart from those characteristics Tinky Winky also carries a magic bag which the ''NLJ'' and ''Salon'' articles said was a purse. Falwell added that "role modelling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children".

===September 11th attacks===
After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Falwell said on [[Pat Robertson]]'s ''[[The 700 Club]]'', "I really believe that the [[Paganism|pagans]], and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], [[People For the American Way]], all of them who have tried to secularize America.

===Labor unions===
Falwell has also said, "Labor unions should study and read the Bible instead of asking for more money. When people get right with God, they are better workers."<ref>Ricco, Joanne {{Wayback |date=20090512001518 |url=http://www.wisaflcio.org/political_action/rightwing.htm |title="The Right Wing Attack on the American Labor Movement"}} ''Wisconsin State AFL-CIO'' Accessed 24 May 2011.</ref>

===Relationship to American Fundamentalism===
Falwell set out in his Christian ministry as a Fundamentalist, having attended a conservative Bible college and following strict standards of [[Doctrine of separation|ecclesiastical and personal separatism]]; he was thus known and respected in [[Independent Baptist|IFB]] circles, being praised in far-right publications such as [[The Sword of the Lord]]. Though he never officially stated his rejection of this movement, the evidence of his life from the late 1970s onwards indicates he moved toward a conservative Evangelical standpoint to the right of [[mainline Protestant]]ism or "open" Evangelicalism but to the left of traditional, separatist Fundamentalism. It was reported that he had refused to attend parties at which alcohol was served early in his life, but relaxed this stricture as he was increasingly invited to major events through the contacts he developed in conservative politics and religion.

His foray into national politics appears to be a catalyst for this change; when he established the Moral Majority which joined "Bible Christians" (Independent and conservative Southern Baptists) in a political alliance with [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatics]], Roman Catholics, Jews, Mormons and others he rejected the level of separation preached by most movement Fundamentalists. [[Bob Jones University]] declared the Moral Majority organization "Satanic", holding that it was a step toward the apostate one-world church and government body as it would cross the line from a political alliance to a religious one between true Christians and the non-born-again, as forbidden by their interpretation of the Bible. David Cloud's Way of Life Literature also criticizes Falwell for associations with Catholics, Pentecostals and liberal Christians, tracing his alleged "apostasy" back to his role in the political Religious Right.

Though he never wavered in his belief in the inerrancy of the Bible (except for moderating its alleged view of racial differences, significance of baptism, and other concepts relative to his theology) and the doctrines conservative Christians widely see as essential to salvation, his rhetoric became generally more mellow, less militant and comparatively more inclusive from the 1980s onward. Cultural anthropologist Susan Friend Harding, in her extensive ethnographic study of Falwell, noted that he adapted his preaching to win a broader, less extremist audience as he grew famous. This manifested in several ways: among them were no longer condemning "worldly" lifestyle choices such as dancing, drinking wine, and attending movie theaters; softening rhetoric of apocalypse and God's vengeful wrath; and shifting from outright [[Biblical patriarchy]] to a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]] view of appropriate gender roles. He further mainstreamed himself by aiming his strongest criticism at [[Secular humanism|"secular humanists"]], pagans or various liberals in place of the racist, anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic rhetoric common among Southern Fundamentalist preachers but increasingly condemned as [[hate speech]] by the consensus of American society.<ref>Susan Harding (2001). ''The book of Jerry Falwell: fundamentalist language and politics.'' Princeton University Press, ''passim''.</ref>

===Islam===
Jerry Falwell held views in opposition to [[Islam]]. According to ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', a pan-Arab newspaper, Falwell called Islam "satanic".<ref>[http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/10900 A case that is forgotten...another group of takfir] from ''[[Arab-West Report]]''</ref> In a televised interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Falwell called [[Muhammad]] a "terrorist", to which he added: "I concluded from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writers that Muhammad was a violent man, a man of war." Falwell later apologized to Muslims for what he said about Muhammad and affirmed that he did not necessarily intend to offend "honest and peace-loving" Muslims. However, as he refused to remove his comments about Islam in his website, the sincerity of his apology was doubted.<ref>[http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/16194 Rev. Jerry Falwell: I think Muhammad was a terrorist] from ''[[Arab-West Report]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/7337 Recent developments] from ''[[Arab-West Report]]''</ref> [[Egyptian Christian]] intellectuals, in response, signed a statement in which they condemned and rejected what Falwell had said about Muhammad being a terrorist.<ref>[http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/15419 Christian leaders in Egypt condemn Jerry Falwell's statement about the Prophet being a terrorist] from ''[[Arab-West Report]]''</ref>

==Legal issues==
In the 1970s Falwell began experiencing involvement in a series of legal matters which occupied much of his time for the remainder of his life and also propelled his name recognition.

===SEC and bonds===
In 1972, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) launched an investigation of [[bond (finance)|bonds]] issued by Falwell's organizations. The SEC charged Falwell's church with "[[fraud]] and [[deceit]]" in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds.<ref name = "npr-potent">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5522064|title= Religion, Politics a Potent Mix for Jerry Falwell|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the behest of the SEC, in which the Court exonerated the church and ruled that while technical violations of law did occur, there was no proof the Church intended any wrongdoing.

===Falwell versus ''Penthouse''===
Falwell filed a $10 million lawsuit against ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' for publishing an article based upon interviews he gave to [[Freelancer|freelance]] reporters, after failing to convince a federal court to place an injunction upon the publication of that article. The suit was dismissed in Federal district court on the grounds that the article was not [[defame|defamatory]] or an invasion of Falwell's [[privacy]] (the Virginia courts had not recognized this privacy tort, which is recognized in other states).<ref>"Falwell Says He Will Press $10 Million Penthouse Suit." ''The New York Times''. February 5, 1981.</ref><ref>"Penthouse Wins in Court Against Falwell Suit." ''The New York Times''. August 7, 1981.</ref><ref>"Falwell Won't Pursue Suit". ''The New York Times''. September 10, 1981.</ref>

===Falwell versus ''Hustler''===
{{Main|Hustler Magazine v. Falwell}}
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Falwellhustler.jpg|thumb|right|''Hustler's'' parody ad of Falwell]] -->In November 1983, [[Larry Flynt]]'s [[Pornography|pornographic]] magazine ''[[Hustler]]'' carried a [[parody advertisement]] of a [[Campari]] ad, featuring a fake interview with Falwell in which he admits that his "first time" was incest with his mother in an [[outhouse]] while drunk. Falwell sued for $45 million in compensation alleging invasion of privacy, libel, and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} After a civil trial, known as ''Falwell vs. Flynt'', which lasted from December 3–8, 1984, a [[jury]] rejected the invasion of privacy and libel claims, holding that the parody could not have reasonably been taken to describe true events, but ruled in favor of Falwell on the emotional distress claim and ordered Larry Flynt to pay Falwell damages in the amount of $200,000. This was upheld on appeal. Flynt then appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], winning an unanimous decision on February 24, 1988. The ruling held that public figures cannot circumvent [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections by attempting to recover damages based on emotional distress suffered from parodies. The decision in favor of Flynt strengthened [[free speech]] rights in the United States in relation to parodies of public figures.

After the death of Falwell, Larry Flynt released a comment regarding his friendship over the years with Falwell.
<blockquote>My mother always told me that no matter how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find characteristics about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/20/opinion/op-flynt20|title=The porn king and the preacher|last=Flynt|first=Larry|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-05-20}}</ref></blockquote>

===Falwell versus Jerry Sloan===
In 1984, Falwell was ordered to pay [[gay rights]] activist and former Baptist Bible College classmate Jerry Sloan $5,000 after losing a court battle. In July 1984 during a TV debate in [[Sacramento, California]], Falwell denied calling the homosexual-friendly [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es "brute beasts" and "a vile and [[Satanism|Satanic]] system" that will "one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven".<ref name=vile>{{cite web | last=Burns | first=Katy |url=http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070517/REPOSITORY/705170342/1028/OPINION02 |title=Jerry Falwell's greatest hates |accessdate=May 18, 2007 }}</ref>

When Sloan insisted he had a tape, Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did, Falwell refused to pay, and Sloan successfully sued. The money was donated to build Sacramento's first homosexual community center, the Lambda Community Center, serving "[[lesbian]], gay, [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersex]]" communities.<ref name="intersex">{{cite web | url=http://web.Archive.org/web/20080125043503/http://www.saccenter.org/about.php |title=about Lambda Community Fund |accessdate=April 9, 2009 }}</ref> Falwell appealed the decision with his attorney charging that the Jewish judge in the case was prejudiced. He lost again and was made to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court fees.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=unQdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u2IEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5828,4267772&dq=sloan+vs+falwell&hl=en Court rejects Rev.

===Falwell versus Christopher Lamparello===
{{main|Lamparello v. Falwell}}
In ''Lamparello v. Falwell'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] reversed an earlier District Court decision, arguing that Lamparello "clearly created his Web site intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers."<ref name="websitelawsuit">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12356113/ Supreme Court declines Falwell Web appeal] Associated Press. April 17, 2006</ref> Lamparello's website describes itself as not being connected to Jerry Falwell and is critical of Falwell's views on [[homosexuality]].<ref name="websitelawsuit" /> On April 17, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] declined to [[Certiorari|hear]] an appeal of the Court of Appeals ruling that Christopher Lamparello's usage of the Internet domain "Fallwell.com" was legal.

Previous to this, "Falwell's attorneys have fought over domain names in the past" with a different man who eventually turned over [[Lamparello v. Falwell#Related case: jerryfalwell.com|jerryfalwell.com]] and jerryfallwell.com after Falwell threatened to sue for [[trademark infringement]].<ref name="websitelawsuit" /> Lawyers for [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]]'s Internet Free Speech project represented the domain name owners in both cases.

==Apocalyptic beliefs==
On July 31, 2006, [[Cable News Network]]'s (CNN) ''[[Paula Zahn Now]]'' program featured a segment on "whether the crisis in the Middle East is actually a prelude to the end of the world". In an interview Falwell claimed, "I believe in the premillennial, pre-tribulational coming of Christ for all of his church, and to summarize that, your first poll, do you believe Jesus' coming the second time will be in the future, I would vote yes with the 59 percent and with Billy Graham and most evangelicals."<ref>''Paula Zahn Now'', CNN: [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/31/pzn.01.html Transcript.]  July 31, 2006.</ref>

Based on this and other statements, Falwell has been identified as a [[Dispensationalism|Dispensationalist]].<ref>Jerry L. Walls (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 269.</ref>

In 1999, Falwell declared the [[Antichrist]] would probably arrive within a decade and "of course he'll be Jewish".<ref name=Antichrist>{{cite web | last=Cohen | first=Debra Nussbaum|url=http://www.jweekly.com/includes/print/9993/article/falwell-antichrist-remark-sparks-anti-semitism-charges/ |title=Falwell Antichrist remark sparks anti-Semitism charges |accessdate=May 18, 2007 }}</ref> After accusations of anti-Semitism Falwell apologized and explained that he was simply expressing the theological tenet that the Antichrist and [[Christ]] share many attributes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6160167 |title= NPR: Cultural Impact of the Book of Revelation |accessdate=January 6, 2009  |date=September 28, 2006|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>

==Failing health and death==
In early 2005, Falwell was hospitalized for two weeks with a [[viral infection]], discharged, and then rehospitalized on May 30, 2005, in [[respiratory arrest]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Falwell: The church won the 2004 elections|url=http://www.wsfa.com/Global/story.asp?S=3500772&nav=0RdEbGkt|newspaper=WSFA 12|date=June 21, 2005}}</ref><ref name="condition">[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-03-30-falwell_x.htm Falwell is taken off ventilator, upgraded to stable condition].

On May 15, 2007, Falwell was found without pulse and unconscious in his office at about 10:45&nbsp;a.m. after missing a morning appointment, and was taken to Lynchburg General Hospital.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2007-05-15-falwell-hospital_N.htm?csp=34|title=Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73|date=May 15, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2007| publisher = [[USA Today]]/[[Associated Press]] | first1=Susan | last1=Page}}</ref> "I had breakfast with him, and he was fine at breakfast...He went to his office, I went to mine and they found him unresponsive" said Ron Godwin, the executive vice president of Falwell's [[Liberty University]]. His condition was initially reported as "gravely serious"; [[CPR]] was administered unsuccessfully. As of 2:10&nbsp;p.m., during a live press conference, a doctor for the hospital confirmed that Falwell had died of "[[cardiac arrhythmia]], or [[sudden cardiac death]]". A statement issued by the hospital reported he was pronounced dead at Lynchburg General Hospital at 12:40&nbsp;p.m., EST. Falwell's family, including his wife Macel and sons [[Jerry Falwell, Jr]]. and [[Jonathan Falwell]], were at the hospital at the time of the pronouncement.

Falwell's funeral took place on May 22, 2007, at Thomas Road Baptist Church after he lay in repose at both the church and Liberty University. Falwell's [[burial]] service was private. It took place at a spot on the Liberty University campus near the [[Montview|Carter Glass Mansion]], near his office. Buried nearby is [[B. R. Lakin]].

After his death, his two sons succeeded him at his two posts; Jerry Falwell, Jr., took over as Chancellor of Liberty University while Jonathan Falwell became the Senior Pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church.

The last televised interview with Jerry Falwell was conducted by [[Christiane Amanpour]] for the [[CNN]] original series ''[[God's Warriors|CNN Presents: God's Warriors]].''<ref>[http://www.hvc-inc.com/clients/cnn/warriors/for.html#pr CNN&nbsp;– God's Warriors]{{dead link|date=January 2014}} from [[CNN]]</ref> He had been interviewed on May 8, one week before his death.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2007/08/16/gods.warriors.fallwell.cnn Christians and Jerry Falwell], interview with CNN's [[Christiane Amanpour]] from [[CNN]]</ref> Falwell's last televised sermon was his May 13, 2007, message on [[Mother's Day]].

==Legacy and criticisms==
Falwell's legacy is strongly mixed and often a source of heated controversy. Supporters praise his advancement of his [[social conservative|socially conservative]] message. They also tout his evangelist ministries, and his stress on church planting and growth. Many of his detractors have accused him of [[hate speech]] and identified him as an "agent of intolerance".<ref name="intolerance"/>

He was described by atheist social commentator [[Christopher Hitchens]] in turns as a "Chaucerian fraud" and a "faith-based fraud". Hitchens took special umbrage with Falwell's alignment with "the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers", and his declaration that [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] represented God's judgement on America's sinful behaviour; deeming it "extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the 'faith-based.'" Hitchens also mentioned that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell "kept saying to his own crowd, yes, you have got to like the Jews, because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime".<ref>[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]]. "[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2007/05/faithbased_fraud.html Jerry Falwell, faith-based fraud]." ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. May 16 [[2007 in literature|2007]]. Retrieved September 3, 2013.</ref> Appearing on [[CNN]] a day after Falwell's death, Hitchens said, "The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that you can get away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called 'reverend'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/15/acd.01.html|title=Jerry Falwell's Legacy|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>  On [[C-SPAN]], Hitchens made the comment that "if he had been given an [[enema]], he could have been buried in a matchbox".<ref>Interview on C-SPAN's Q&A with Brian Lamb on Sunday, April 26, 2009.</ref>

Falwell was an enemy of the revenge humorist "[[George Hayduke (author)|George Hayduke]]", who called Falwell a "fund-grubbing electronic Bible-banger" and "pious pride-in-the-pulpit". In his book ''Screw Unto Others'', Hayduke mentions the story of Edward Johnson, who, in the mid-1980s, programmed his [[Atari]] home computer to make thousands of repeat phone calls to Falwell's 1–800 phone number, since Johnson claimed Falwell had swindled large amounts of money from his followers, especially Johnson's own mother. [[Southern Bell]] forced Johnson to stop after he had run up Falwell's telephone bill an estimated $500,000. At one point, prank callers, especially gay activists, made up about 25% of Falwell's total calls, until the ministry disconnected the toll-free number in 1986.<ref>Hayduke, George.
