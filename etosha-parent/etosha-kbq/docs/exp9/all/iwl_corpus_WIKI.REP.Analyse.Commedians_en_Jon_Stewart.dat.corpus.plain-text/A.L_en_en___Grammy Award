A '''Grammy Award''' (originally called '''Gramophone Award'''), or '''Grammy''', is an accolade by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] (NARAS) of the United States to recognize outstanding achievement in the [[music industry]]. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance arts: [[Emmy Award]]s (television), the [[Tony Award]]s (stage performance), and the [[Academy Award]]s (motion pictures).

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, NARAS overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012. The [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|57th Grammy Awards]] was held on February 8, 2015, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].

== History ==
The Grammy Awards had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].  This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the phonograph, [[Thomas Edison]]. They finally settled on using the name of the invention of [[Emile Berliner]], the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], for the awards, which were first given for the year 1958.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5wQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1440,1446700&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular Of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cEgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,1739274&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

== Gramophone trophy ==
The gold-plated trophies, each depicting a gilded gramophone, are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in [[Ridgway, Colorado]].  In 1990 the original Grammy design was revamped, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/grammy_making.php |title=Making the Grammy |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year= 2006|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>  The trophies with the recipient's name engraved on them are not available until after the award announcements, so "stunt" trophies are re-used each year for the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |title=About Billings Artworks |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year= 2006|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>

By February 2009, 7,578 Grammy trophies had been awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&newsCategoryID=1 |title=Neil Portnow's 50th Grammy's Telecast Remarks |publisher=grammy com |date=February 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>

== Categories ==
{{Main|List of Grammy Award categories}}

The "General Field" are four awards which are not restricted by genre.

* [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a full album.
* [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song.
* [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] is awarded to the writer(s)/composer(s) of a single song.
* [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] is awarded to a promising breakthrough performer who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording that establishes the public identity of that artist (which is not necessarily their first proper release).

Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.

Because of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. Other awards are presented in a pre-telecast ceremony earlier in the afternoon of the Grammy awards ceremony.

=== 2012 category restructuring ===

On April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.<ref>[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am Grammy.org, 6 June 2011]</ref> The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.

In the [[rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.

In [[R&B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&B Album]] category.

In [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.

The most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]]|title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="NYT090605">{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>

In the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.

In the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.

There were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word "gospel" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process Grammy announcement, 6 April 2011]</ref>

Since 2012, there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has gone up from 78 in 2012 to 83 in 2015.

== Nomination process ==
Record companies and individuals may submit recordings to be nominated. Nominations are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, by more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is eligible and entered in the correct category for official nomination.

The resulting list is circulated to all NARAS members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general field ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.<ref name="VotingProcess">{{cite web | url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.

Whereas members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of movies nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings.

After nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to Recording Academy members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than eight of the 30 fields. NARAS members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/ |title=Grammy Awards Voting Process |publisher=grammy com |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie. Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.

In both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the academy.

The eligibility period for the 57th Annual Grammy Awards was October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014.

== Venue ==
{{main|List of Grammy Award ceremony locations}}
Prior to 1971, the Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day. Originally [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] were the host cities. [[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.

The 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles's [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.

In 2004, the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.

The awards ceremony forces the [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] & [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to play an extended length of road games.

== Criticism ==
The Grammy Awards has received criticism from various recording artists and music journalists.

When his band [[Pearl Jam]] won a Grammy in the category ''[[Best Hard Rock Performance]]'' in 1996, singer [[Eddie Vedder]] commented on stage: "I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything."<ref>Travers, Peter. [http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/videos/grammy-the-movies-20080208 "Grammy & The Movies"]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. February 8, 2008.</ref> [[Glen Hansard]], leader of the Irish rock group [[The Frames]], stated in 2008 that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music "that's fully industry based." He said he wasn't that interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two different awards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/columnists/contenderqa/env-en-songs6feb06,0,4879961.story | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Todd | last=Martens | title=Glen Hansard, Eddie Vedder crash Grammy Awards | date=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130221000127/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/columnists/contenderqa/env-en-songs6feb06,0,4879961.story |archivedate= February 2013 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> [[Maynard James Keenan]], lead singer of [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of their awards. He explained his reasons:

{{quote|I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry. They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses. They don't honor the arts or the artist for what he created. It's the music business celebrating itself. That's basically what it's all about.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/tool_int.asp | title = Interview with Maynard James Keenan of Tool | author = Gabriella | publisher = [[NY Rock]] | date = July 2002 }}</ref>}}

It has also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful albums.<ref>Deitz, Jason (February 10, 2011).

O'Connor would go on to win the latter category. She said that her reasoning came from the Grammys' extreme commercialism.<ref>{{cite web|author=Johnny Firecloud |url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/129524-the-grammys-top-10-bashers-boycotters |title=The Grammys Top 10 Bashers & Boycotters |publisher=CraveOnline |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>

In a 2011 article, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Randall Roberts was critical of the nominations for the [[54th Grammy Awards]], particularly for the Album of the Year category, noting the exclusion of [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'', "the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record", as a snub in favor of nominating less substantial albums.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/critics-notebook-your-grannys-awards.html|title=Critic's Notebook: Grammy Awards? Your granny's awards |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> Roberts went on to criticize the Grammy Awards for being "mired in the past" and out of touch with "new media" and trends amongs music listeners such as [[file sharing|music sharing]], stating:

{{quote|The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population. [...] And if one were to measure the vitality of American music through the filter of the Grammy nominations for song of the year and record of the year, one might think the economy wasn't the only thing that was sluggish. [...] [T]he focus is still on the old music industry model of [[Cash cow|cash-cow]] hits, major label investments and commercial radio. [...] Falling behind the times is nothing new for the Grammys, but once they've lost sight of the artistry that makes music soar, they'll not just be irrelevant, they'll be out of business.<ref name="Roberts"/>|Randall Roberts}}

In an article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] also responded to the snub and expressed his general displeasure with the awards, stating "I don't pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye's masterpiece ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year."<ref name="Touré"/> He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to [[Kremlinology]] and commented on The Recording Academy's exclusion of more "mature" hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate "pop-friendly" hip hop albums instead.<ref name="Touré">{{cite web |author=Touré |authorlink=Touré (journalist) |url=http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/02/grammys-fallout-the-subtle-snubbing-of-kanye/ |title=Touré: Why The Grammys Snubbed Kanye West's Twisted Fantasy |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>

In a 2011 profile for ''[[The New York Times]]'' following the [[53rd Grammy Awards]], frontman [[Justin Vernon]] of indie band [[Bon Iver]] was asked his opinion of the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded,

<blockquote>You know I was thinking about that a couple of months ago, someone asked me that, and I was like "I would go and I would" – and I don't think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy – "I would get up there and be like, 'This is for my parents, because they supported me,' because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there. But I kinda felt like going up there and being like: "Everyone should go home, this is ridiculous. You should not be doing this. We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important." That's what I would say.<ref name="Caramanica">{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/the-bon-iver-grammy-quandary/ |title=The Bon Iver Grammy Quandary |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=The 6th Floor |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys, saying:

{{quote|[Ninety-eight]<!-- Changed from "98" because numbers that begin a sentence are spelled out, per [[WP:NUMERAL]]. --> percent of the people in that room, their art is compromised by the fact that they're thinking that, and that they're hoping to get that award. And who is that award given by? It's like they think it's literally handed down by the musical-history gods. And I don't know who the voters are. Like, I have a friend who's a voter who was like, "I had to be a voter because I don't trust the other voters." And I was like, "Me either!" And it's just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it.<ref name="Caramanica"/>|Justin Vernon}}

Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards.<ref name="Caramanica"/> After winning the award, Vernon said in his acceptance, "It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here [...] and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here."<ref name="Lee">{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Amy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/bon-iver-grammys_n_1272975.html |title=Grammys 2012: Bon Iver Wins Best New Artist, Feels Conflicted About It |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

In his article "Everything Is Praised Again", Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' criticized Grammy voters for being "conservative" and disregarding more "forward-looking" music, and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, "for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change."<ref name="Caramanica2"/> He cited the Grammy successes of [[Lauryn Hill]]'s ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill|The Miseducation]]'' (1999), [[Norah Jones]]' ''[[Come Away with Me]]'' (2003), and [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011) as examples of "the Grammys dropp[ing] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album." Of Kanye West's absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, "He didn't even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough, because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized".<ref name="Caramanica2">{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/arts/music/at-the-54th-grammy-awards-everything-old-is-praised-again.html |title=At the 54th Grammy Awards, Everything Old Is Praised Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

In an article for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', music executive and author [[Steve Stoute]] criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having "lost touch with contemporary popular culture" and noted "two key sources" for it: "(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic."<ref name="Stoute">{{cite news |last=Stoute |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Stoute |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-stoute/steve-stoute-grammys_b_825377.html |title=Steve Stoute: An Open Letter to Neil Portnow, NARAS and the Grammy Awards |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref> Stoute accused them of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000) and Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' (2007) in the Album of the Year category, and stated:

{{quote|As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and technical specialists, we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture. Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.<ref name="Stoute"/>|Steve Stoute}}

== TV broadcasts and ratings ==
Prior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), a series of taped annual specials in the 1960s called ''The Best on Record'' were broadcast on National Broadcasting Company ([[NBC]]). The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''Sunday Showcase'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5}}</ref> [[CBS]] Broadcasting bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.

The Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011 that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract the network also airs a "nominations concert" special in the last week of November where the nominees are released during the special that is exclusive to CBS, rather than the traditional early-morning press conference with a release of the nominations seen with most major awards ceremonies which any network takes as part of a [[press pool]].
