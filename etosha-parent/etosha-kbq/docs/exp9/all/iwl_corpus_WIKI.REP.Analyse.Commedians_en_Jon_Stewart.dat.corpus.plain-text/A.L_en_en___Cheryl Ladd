==Career==
[[File:Cheryl Ladd Fotos International 1977.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Cheryl Ladd, 1977]]
Ladd initially came to Hollywood in 1970 to begin a career in music (she was known as "Cherie Moor" when she was the singing voice of Melody on [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' animated series).<ref>http://www.toonbarn.com/other-cartoons/greatest-tv-cartoon-theme-songs-13-josie-pussy-cats/</ref> She soon began to land non-singing roles in commercials and episodic television—including guest appearances on shows such as ''[[The Rookies]]'', ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]''. The ''Charlie's Angels'' series made her an overnight star, and Ladd took the opportunity of her sudden popularity to further pursue her musical interests, guest-starring in [[variety show|musical-comedy variety series]] and specials, performing the National Anthem at the [[Super Bowl XIV]] in January 1980, and releasing three albums, enjoying a [[Top 40]] [[Hot 100]] single and a [[Gold record]].<ref>http://popdose.com/lost-in-the-70s-cheryl-ladd-think-it-over/</ref> In September 2000, Ladd starred on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], taking over the title role from [[Bernadette Peters]] in a revival of [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. She played the role until January 2001, when [[Reba McEntire]] took over.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=November 7, 2011|title=New Star Fills the Balcony, Doin' What Comes Natur'lly; A Familiar Face Can Rejuvenate a Musical|publisher=[[The New York Times]] |year=2001 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/28/theater/new-star-fills-balcony-doin-what-comes-natur-lly-familiar-face-can-rejuvenate.html}}</ref>

Following ''Charlie's Angels'', Ladd remained a familiar face on television and has starred in more than 30 made for television films, including as [[Grace Kelly]], the Philadelphia heiress who became a Hollywood glamour girl and then a European princess, in a biopic that was begun shortly before Kelly's death. She also starred in feature films such as ''Purple Hearts'', ''[[Millennium (film)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Poison Ivy (1992 film)|Poison Ivy]]'' (featuring [[Drew Barrymore]], who later starred in the film adaptations of ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'') and ''[[Permanent Midnight]]''. Ladd had the lead role in the television series ''[[One West Waikiki]]'' (1994–96), and made guest appearances in other TV shows such as ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Hope and Faith]]'' and ''[[CSI: Miami]]''. From 2003 until the show's cancellation in 2008, Ladd played Jillian Deline, the wife of the lead character Ed Deline ([[James Caan]]), in 29 episodes of the television drama ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]''.

In 1996, Ladd published a children's book, ''The Adventures of Little Nettie Windship''. In 2005, she published ''Token Chick: A Woman’s Guide to Golfing With the Boys'', an autobiographical book which focused on her love of golf. For several years, Ladd hosted a golf tournament sponsored by [[Buick]].

On April 17, 2010, Ladd, along with her co-angel, [[Jaclyn Smith]], accepted the "2010 TV Land Pop Culture Award" for ''Charlie's Angels''.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1399794085288</ref>

In 2010, Ladd filmed a TV movie titled ''Love's Everlasting Courage'' for the [[Hallmark Channel]], which aired on October 1, 2011.<ref>http://hallmarkchannel.com/loveseverlastingcourage/cast/Cheryl_Ladd</ref> That same month, she guest starred on ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' in the show's ninth season episode "Thirst" as the love interest of [[medical examiner]] [[Donald "Ducky" Mallard|Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard]].<ref>http://www.tv.com/shows/ncis/thirst-1401692/cast/</ref> In December 2011, she guest starred in an episode of ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'', playing [[Sarah Walker (Chuck)|Sarah Walker]]'s mother.<ref>http://www.buddytv.com/articles/chuck/chuck-season-5-news-meet-sarah-42030.aspx</ref>
