On January 8, 2011, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Gabrielle Giffords]] and eighteen others were shot during a constituent meeting held in a supermarket parking lot in [[Casas Adobes, Arizona]], in the [[Tucson metropolitan area]]. Six people died, including [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|federal District Court]] Chief Judge [[John Roll]]; Gabe Zimmerman, one of Rep.

Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords.<ref name="I planned"/> The motive for the shooting remains unclear; Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his [[Right to silence#United States|right to remain silent]].<ref name="CNN2011-01-08"/> He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be [[Competence (law)|incompetent to stand trial]] based on two [[Competency evaluation (law)|medical evaluations]], which diagnosed him with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].<ref name=competence/> Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.

Following the shooting, American and international politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Attention focused on the harsh political rhetoric in the United States. Some commentators blamed members of the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, [[Sarah Palin]] was implicated because of gun-related metaphors in her speeches and because of the website of [[SarahPAC|her political action committee]] which "targeted" the districts of Giffords and others with pictures of [[Telescopic sight|crosshairs]] on an electoral map. Others defended Palin by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation.<ref name=rhetoric/> [[Gun control]] advocates pushed for increased restrictions on the sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity [[ammunition magazines]].<ref name="gun_control"/> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] led [[Barack Obama Tucson memorial speech|a nationally televised memorial service]] on January 12, and other memorials took place.

Prosecutors representing the State of Arizona filed murder and attempted murder charges on behalf of the victims who were not federal employees.

On August 7, 2012, Loughner's competency hearing began with testimony from Dr. Christina Pietz, Loughner's [[forensic psychologist]], who testified that she believed Loughner was competent to stand trial.  After hearing the evidence, Judge Burns ruled that Loughner was competent to stand trial, whereupon Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 counts, sparing himself the death penalty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jared Loughner is found competent to stand trial |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/20120807tucson-shooting-loughner-court-hearing.html|work=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}</ref>

The political climate in the United States and in Arizona in particular was pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, [[Clarence Dupnik]], Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, "When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous." He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become "the capital" of such feelings.
