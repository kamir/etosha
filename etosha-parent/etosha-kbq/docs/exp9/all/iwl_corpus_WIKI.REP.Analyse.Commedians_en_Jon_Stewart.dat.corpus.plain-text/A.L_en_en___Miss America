'''Miss America''' is an annual competition open to women from the [[United States]] between the ages of 17 and 24. Originating in the 1920s as a [[beauty pageant]], the competition is now judged on competitors' talent performances and interviews in addition to their physical appearance. It is run by the ''Miss America Organization'', a not-for-profit corporation based in [[Linwood, New Jersey]], which has developed the "Miss America Scholarship Program", which awards educational [[scholarship]]s to successful competitors.<ref name="Become a Contestant">[http://www.missamerica.org/competition-info/become-a-contestant.aspx Become a Contestant]</ref> The stated purpose for the contest is that it "provides young women with a vehicle to further their personal and professional goals and instills a spirit of community service through a variety of unique nationwide community-based programs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missamerica.org/organization-info/corporate-info-overview.aspx |title=Corporate Info Overview |publisher=Miss America |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}</ref> Miss America travels about 20,000 miles a month, changing her location every 24 to 48 hours, touring the nation and promoting her particular platform of interest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Ellwood|first2=Darcy|last2=Martin|title=The Miss America Pageant: Pluralism, Femininity, and Cinderella All in One|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]|year=2000|volume=1|issue=34|pages=105–126}}</ref>

The current title-holder, [[Miss America 2015]], is [[Miss New York]] 2014, [[Kira Kazantsev]]. She is the third consecutive Miss America winner from the state of [[New York]], and was crowned on September 14, 2014, by her predecessor [[Nina Davuluri]] ([[Miss America 2014]]).

The origins of the ''Miss America Pageant'' lie in a 1920 event entitled ''The Fall Frolic''. Held on September 25 in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], the event was designed to bring business to the Boardwalk: "three hundred and fifty gaily decorated rolling wicker chairs were pushed along the parade route. Three hundred and fifty men pushed the chairs. However, the main attractions were the young 'maidens' who sat in the rolling chairs, headed by a Miss Ernestine Cremona, who was dressed in a flowing white robe and represented "Peace." <ref name="early">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_first.html|title=People & Events: The First Miss America Beauty Pageant, 1921|publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>

The event was so successful that ''The Businessmen's League'' planned to repeat it the following year as a [[beauty pageant]]  or a "bather's revue" <ref name="early" /> (to capitalize on the popularity of newspaper-based beauty contests that used photo submissions).<ref name="early" /> Thus, "newspapers as far west as Pittsburgh and as far south as Washington, D.C., were asked to sponsor local beauty contests. The winners would participate in the Atlantic City contest. If the local newspaper would pay for the winner's wardrobe, the Atlantic City Businessmen's League would pay for the contestant's travel to compete in the ''Inter-City Beauty Contest''."<ref name="early" /> Herb Test, a "newspaperman" coined the term for the winner as, "Miss America."<ref name="early" /> On September 8, 1921, 100,000 people gathered at the Boardwalk to watch the contestants from [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Harrisburg]], [[Ocean City, New Jersey|Ocean City]], [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="early" /> The 16 year-old winner from [[Washington D.C.]], [[Margaret Gorman]] was crowned the "Golden Mermaid" and won $100.<ref name="early" />

The pageant continued consistently over the next eight decades except for the years 1929–1933, when it was temporarily shut down due to financial problems associated with the [[Great Depression]] and suggestions that it promoted "loose morals."<ref name="shut">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/timeline/timeline2.html|title=Miss America Timeline: 1901–1950|publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref> With its revival in 1933, 15 year-old [[Marian Bergeron]] won, prompting future contestants to be between the ages of 18 to 26.<ref name="shut" /> In 1935, Lenora Slaughter was hired to "re-invent" the pageant and served for 32 years as its Director.<ref name="shut" /> By 1938, a talent section was added to the competition, and contestants were required to have a chaperone.<ref name="shut" /> In 1940, the title officially became "The Miss America Pageant" and the pageant was held in Atlantic City's Convention Hall.<ref name="shut" /> In 1944, compensation for "Miss America" switched from "furs and movie contracts" to college scholarships.<ref name="shut" />

During the 1930s, under the directorship of Lenora Slaughter, the pageant became segregated as rule number seven stated: "contestants must be of good health and  [[Jim Crow laws|of the white race]]."<ref name="pbs" /> Rule seven was abolished in 1950.<ref name="Reginald">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OKswV1U_M5QC&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=%22+until+1950%22+%22miss+america%22#v=onepage&q=%22%20until%201950%22%20%22miss%20america%22&f=false |title=Race and Multiraciality in Brazil and the United States: Converging Paths? |first=G.

== History ==

=== The early years ===
Margaret Gorman, Miss District of Columbia, was declared "The Most Beautiful Bathing Girl in America" in 1921 at the age of 16 and was recognized as the first "Miss America" when she returned to compete the next year. The contest that year was won by [[Mary Katherine Campbell]] ([[Miss Ohio]])  and again in 1923.<ref>[http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1920/1923.aspx Mary Katherine Campbell]</ref> She returned to compete a third time in 1924 but placed as first runner-up that year.  Beginning in 1940, [[Bob Russell (television presenter)|Bob Russell]] served as the first official host of the Pageant.<ref name=Russell /> In 1941, Mifauny Shunatona, [[Miss Oklahoma]], became the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] contestant.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/02/local/me-chee2 |title=Yun Tau Chee, 73; Miss Hawaii of 1948, First Asian in Miss America Pageant – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=September 4, 1987 |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |first=Elaine |last=Woo}}</ref>

In 1945, [[Bess Myerson]] became the first [[Jewish-American]] and the first [[Miss New York]] <ref name="mabio">{{cite web|url=http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1940/1945.aspx|title=Bess Myerson Biography (Miss America 1945)|publisher= [[Miss America Organization]]}}</ref> (competing as Miss New York City, a competition organized by a local radio station<ref name=latobit />) to win the Miss America Pageant as [[Miss America 1945]].<ref name="americanexperiencetranscript" /><ref name=nytmyobit /><ref name=latobit /><ref name=wsjobitbm /> As the only Jewish contestant, Myerson was encouraged by the pageant directors to change her name to "Bess Meredith"<ref name="nymagbess">{{cite web|url=http://www.patriciamorrisroe.com/sites/default/files/articles/Bess-and-the-Mess.pdf|title=Bess and the Mess: Myerson's Slide Into Scandal (pp. 34-35)|last=Morrisroe|first=Patricia|date=March 30, 1987|publisher=[[New York (magazine)]]}}</ref> or "Beth Merrick"<ref name="americanexperiencetranscript" /> but she refused.<ref name="americanexperiencetranscript" /><ref name="nymagbess" /> After winning the title (and as a Jewish Miss America), Myerson received few endorsements<ref name="americanexperiencetranscript" /><ref name=nytmyobit /><ref name=latobit /><ref name=wsjobitbm /><ref name="nymagbess" /> and later recalled that "I couldn't even stay in certain hotels […] there would be signs that read no coloreds, no Jews, no dogs. I felt so rejected. Here I was chosen to represent American womanhood and then America treated me like this."<ref name="nymagbess" /> She thus cut short her Miss America tour and instead traveled with the [[Anti-Defamation League]]. In this capacity, she spoke against discrimination in a talk entitled, "You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate."<ref name="americanexperiencetranscript" /><ref name=nytmyobit /><ref name=latobit /><ref name=wsjobitbm /><ref name="nymagbess" />

In 1948, Irma Nydia Vasquez, the first [[Miss Puerto Rico]], became the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latina]] contestant.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>[http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/missamerica/cheryl-browne-was-the-first-african-american-contestant-as-miss/article_9161214a-b0d5-11e2-aad9-001a4bcf887a.html?TNNoMobile Cheryl Browne was the first African-American contestant as Miss Iowa in 1970]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pageantcenter.com/news/2009/miss-america-pageant/miss_america_pageant-news-6-2009.html |title=Miss America Pageant News |publisher=Pageantcenter.com |date=January 30, 2010|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref> In addition, in 1948 Yun Tau Chee, the first [[Miss Hawaii]], was also the first [[Asian-American]] contestant.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> [[Miss America 1949]] [[Jacque Mercer]] was married and divorced during her reign; after this, a rule was enacted requiring Miss America contestants to sign a certification that they have never been married or pregnant.<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-09-17/features/9909170275_1_miss-america-america-contestants-pageant Pageant tightens grip on its ideals]</ref> Starting in 1950, although the pageant continued to be in September, the Miss America title changed to "post-dated", thus that year's pageant winner became Miss American 1951, and there was no Miss America 1950.

=== 1968–2013 ===
With the rise of [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[civil right]]s movement during the 1960s, the Miss America Pageant became the subject of protests that attacked it as sexist and racist. In 1968, about 400 members of the group [[New York Radical Women]] demonstrated during the event on the Atlantic City boardwalk by comparing it to a county fair where livestock are judged.<ref name=imagesnj>{{cite web|url=http://officialnj350.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Miss-America.-Atlantic-City.-It-Happened-Here-New-Jersey.-Image-Credits.pdf|title=It Happened Here in New Jersey: Miss America|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher= [[Kean University]] and the  New Jersey Historical Commission}}</ref><ref name="68npr">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94240375&from=mobile|title=Pageant Protest Sparked Bra-Burning Myth|last=Greenfieldboyce|first=Nell|date=September 5, 2008|publisher= [[NPR]]}}</ref> They thus crowned a [[sheep]] as Miss America and symbolically destroying a number of feminine products, including false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, [[girdle]]s, [[corset]]s and [[bra]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dow, Bonnie J. |title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology |journal=Rhetoric & Public Affairs |volume=6 |issue=1 |date= Spring 2003 |pages=127–149 |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028}}</ref> Burning the contents of a trash can was suggested, but a permit was unobtainable; news media seized on the similarity between [[Draft evasion#Vietnam War|draft resisters]] burning draft cards and women burning their bras.

== Scholarship misrepresentation ==

In September 2014, comedian [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] ran a segment on his show, ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', in which he criticized the Miss America Organization, stating that the organization does not actually give out $45 million in scholarships.  Oliver contends that the actual claim that it 'makes available' "45 million dollars annually" for college scholarships is a figure that is arrived at using carefully calculated math and funds that are never used and have never been distributed. Using the organization's tax returns and other documents, he argued that the organization greatly inflates its number, that it donates far less than it claims to (less than half a million dollars in 2013), and that the $45 million figure the organization uses has little to do with how much they give out.<ref name=timeoliver>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3418349/john-oliver-miss-america-pageant-scholarships/|title=Watch John Oliver Debunk the Miss America Pageant’s Scholarship Claim|last=Dockterman|first=Eliana|date=September 22, 2014|publisher=Time Magazine}}</ref>

Oliver found no record of scholarships being actually granted in amounts even approximately matching the claims made by the foundation.  The organization's response to the segment failed to clarify the position and simply stated the number of scholarships made available to women around the country and did not in any way refute the claims that the $45 million number was inaccurate or misleading as Oliver had contended; the organization's response highlighted their efforts to offer scholarships for participants without further clarification.<ref name=maoresponol>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2014/09/miss_america_john_oliver_scholarships_1.html|title=Miss America Organization responds to John Oliver's segment on pageant|accessdate=|last=Remnick|first=Alex|date=September 22, 2014|publisher=NJ.com}}</ref>
