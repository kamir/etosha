'''David Cunningham "Dave" Garroway''' (July 13, 1913 – July 21, 1982) was an American [[television personality]]. He was the founding host and anchor of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' from 1952 to 1961. His easygoing and relaxing style belied a battle with [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="Troubling"/> Garroway has been honored for his contributions to radio and television with [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame#G|a star for each]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] as well as the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> the city where he spent part of his teenage years and early adulthood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/dave-garroway/|title=Dave Garroway-Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early years===
Garroway began his broadcasting career modestly.

Garroway was introduced to the national [[television]] audience when he hosted the experimental musical variety show ''[[Garroway at Large]]'', telecast live from Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GVIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=dave+garroway#v=onepage&q=dave%20garroway&f=false|title=Dave Garroway: Prop Man At Large|date=October 10, 1949|publisher=Life|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> It was carried by NBC from June 18, 1949, to June 24, 1951.<ref name="Dave Garroway">{{cite book|url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/garroway/index.html|title=TV Turns up a New Comic|date=22 November 1949|publisher=Look|accessdate=29 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/tcs.html|title=The Chicago School With Special Emphasis on Dave Garroway|date=September 11, 1950|publisher=Time|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/garroway/bestofgal.html Video file downloads-The Best of Garroway at Large]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3dgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA144&dq=garroway#v=onepage&q=garroway&f=false|title=They Fool You Every Night|author=Railton, Arthur|date=October 1951|publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>

Garroway's relaxed, informal style when on the air became part of his trademark. In 1960, ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer Richard F. Shepard wrote, "He does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking and not obtrusively convivial." On television, Garroway was known for his signoff, saying "Peace" with an upraised palm.<ref name=NYT/>

Along with [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Arlene Francis]], and [[Jack Paar]], Garroway was one of the pioneers of the television talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/chschool.html|title=Chicago School of Television|author=Samuels, Rich|publisher=Samuels, Rich|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref> Garroway, [[Studs Terkel]], and [[Hugh Downs]] all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative "announcer's" intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence. Garroway was one of the broadcasters who introduced conversational style and tone to television, beginning some broadcasts as though the viewer were sitting in the studio with him, as in this November 20, 1957, introduction for the ''Today'' show: "And how are you about the world today? Let's see what kind of shape it's in; there is a glimmer of hope."

Legendary pioneering NBC president [[Sylvester "Pat" Weaver]] chose Garroway as the host of his new morning news-and-entertainment experiment, the ''Today'' show, in 1951.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8uErAAAAIBAJ&sjid=12UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1599,3971024&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|title=Garroway-More At Large Than On TV|author=Perrigo, Lucia|date=November 9, 1951|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref> He was joined by news editor Jim Fleming and announcer [[Jack Lescoulie]] when the show debuted on Monday, January 14, 1952.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dx4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq=garroway#v=onepage&q=garroway&f=false|title=Add 3½ Hours To WWJ Sked|date=January 19, 1952|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> Though initially panned by critics, Garroway's style attracted a large audience that enjoyed his easygoing presence early in the morning.<ref name="Shows"/><ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Robinson|editor-first=Marc|title=Brought to You in Living Color: 75 Years of Great Moments in Television|year=2003|pages=236|publisher=Wiley|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OLHd9Z6MrWkC&pg=PA62&dq=dave+garroway#v=onepage&q=dave%20garroway&f=false|isbn=0-471-46921-1|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> His familiar "cohost," a [[chimpanzee]] with the puckish name of [[J. Fred Muggs]], didn't hurt his genial manner, but his concurrent seriousness in dealing with news stories and ability to clearly explain abstract concepts earned him the nickname "The Communicator" and eventually won praise from critics and viewers alike.<ref name="News"/>

At the same time he did ''Today'', Garroway also hosted a Friday night variety series, ''The Dave Garroway Show'', from October 2, 1953, to June 25, 1954.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823153,00.html|title=The New Shows|date=November 30, 1953|publisher=Time|accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> On October 16, 1955, he began hosting NBC's live Sunday afternoon documentary ''[[Wide Wide World]]'', continuing with that series until June 8, 1958.

Garroway took ''Today'' to various locations during his tenure: Paris in 1959 and Rome in 1960; car shows and technology expos; plays and movies; and aboard an Air Force [[B-52]] for a practice bombing run.  Through television, Garroway gave viewers access to a variety of people that included politicians, writers, artists, scientists, economists, and musicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8078|title=President John F.

Among them were Admiral television sets, [[Alcoa]] and Sergeant's dog food. Most of the appearances were in the form of print ads in newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardcow.com/94084/flexalum-aluminum-awning-advertising/|title=Flexalum Aluminum Awnings/Garroway postcard|publisher=CardCow|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> By 1960, there was also a board game called "Dave Garroway's ''Today'' Game".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27011/dave-garroways-today-game|title=Dave Garroway's Today Game|publisher=Board Game Geek|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/493495/dave-garroways-today-game|title=Photos of Garroway Today Game|publisher=Board Game Geek|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref>

In 1961, Garroway hosted a special filmed program for the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] that traced [[Billy Graham]]'s crusades from [[Los Angeles Crusade (1949)|1949]] to 1960.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19610315&id=CEkhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IYAFAAAAIBAJ&pg=929,2704827|title=Billy Graham Is To Become TV, Film Star Soon|author=Scott, Vernon|date=March 15, 1961|publisher=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}</ref>

Garroway's easygoing camera presence masked a man who struggled with depression. Toward the end of his professional career, he began to have disagreements with staff members; some days Garroway would disappear in the middle of the ''Today'' broadcast, leaving colleagues to finish the live program. When Garroway's second wife, Pamela, died of a prescription drug overdose on April 28, 1961, Garroway went further into depression and emotional and mental instability.<ref name="Troubling">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2BAwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZhEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6090,2302549&dq=pamela+garroway&hl=en|title=What's Troubling Dave Garroway?|author=Battelle, Phyllis|date=August 8, 1961|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PD4mAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4v4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=786,165228&hl=en|title=Mrs. Dave Garroway Is Found Dead In Apartment|date=28 April 1961|publisher=Gettysburg Times|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aT8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pOUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3505,2015582&hl=en|title=Mrs. Dave Garroway Found Dead Early Today at Home|date=28 April 1961|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> In late May 1961, Garroway resigned, announcing his intention to leave ''Today''-either at the end of October when his contract was finished or sooner, if possible; he wanted to spend more time with his children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fj8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pOUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3574,4431276&dq=dave+garroway&hl=en|title=Dave Garroway Resigns From TV Show to Give More Time to Children|date=May 27, 1961|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FjwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NycEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2430,2080639&dq=pamela+garroway&hl=en|title=Dave Garroway is 'Redecorating' his Life|date=December 3, 1961|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref> <!-- Comment [Concealing as there's nothing to substantiate this either.] Eventually, these troubles affected his on-camera performance.

After leaving ''Today'', Garroway returned to television on [[National Educational Television]] (the forerunner of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]) with a science series called ''Exploring the Universe'' in late 1962.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827959-1,00.html|title=Professor Garroway of 21-inch U.|publisher=Time|date=December 28, 1962|accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> Later he went back to working in radio, doing "split shift" shows called ''Garroway AM'' (mid mornings) and ''Garroway PM'' (mid afternoons) for [[WCBS (AM)]], New York.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U0UEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19&dq=garroway#v=onepage&q=garroway&f=false|title=New Program Chief Named By WCBS|date=June 27, 1964|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref> Garroway also started a magazine, ''National FM-Radio''; the venture was a costly failure with Garroway realizing he was not cut out to be a businessman.<ref name="Era"/> While he was in the publishing business, Garroway began reading various law books in an effort to try to understand what his lawyer was saying. His attorney told him that he had done enough legal reading to pass the New York State bar exam.

In July 1969, Garroway launched a daytime talk show on [[WHDH-TV|WNAC-TV]], ''Tempo Boston,'' which he hoped would be picked up for national syndication. The program lasted into early 1970 and never aired outside Boston. The show had promise but was canceled when management decided to show old movies instead of local live shows.<ref name="Time" /> After leaving the Boston airwaves, Garroway traveled to southern California, hosting a music-and-talk show on [[KFI]] radio in Los Angeles.<ref name="Switch">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mQcdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E5wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6906,3877592&dq=dave+garroway&hl=en|title=Dave Garroway Switches To LA|date=August 28, 1970|publisher=Tuscaloosa News|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> He planned to reenter the television world with a [[CBS]] summer replacement show, ''Newcomers'', but the show never made it past the summer of 1971.<ref name="Obit"/><ref name="California">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oZYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aucFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6897,4307487&dq=dave+garroway&hl=en|title=Dave Garroway will stay in television after summer fling|date=August 9, 1971|author=Lowery, Cynthia|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}</ref> While in Los Angeles, Garroway began to take acting workshops; he had a role in an episode of the western series ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' as a judge in 1972.<ref name="Era">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ankqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SVQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5010,5488692&dq=dave+garroway&hl=en|title='Maybe I Belong In A Long-Gone Era'|author=Monahan, Anthony|date= May 27, 1973|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref>

Garroway appeared sporadically on other television programs without achieving the success and recognition levels he enjoyed on ''Today''. He largely remained out the public eye for the rest of the 1960s and 1970s although he did reemerge for ''Today'' anniversaries. His final such appearance was on the 30th anniversary show, on January 14, 1982.<ref name="Shotgun"/>

===Other media===

Garroway narrated a compilation of romantic songs performed by the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], ''Getting Friendly with Music,'' in 1956. He also served as narrator for special albums, including 1964's ''The Great Campaigners, 1928–1960'' and 1960's ''Names From the Wars.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotplatters.com/hotPlatters_2006/lp/Persona/PERS2A-L.html|title=Hot Platters: Personalities.|publisher=Hot Platters|accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

In 1960, Garroway penned ''Fun on Wheels,'' an activity book for children on road trips. The book was revised and reissued in 1962 and 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/a/OL4437377A/Dave-Garroway|title=Dave Garroway|publisher=Open Library|accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

Toward the end of his life, Garroway planned to write an autobiography. The book never made it past the research stage; the surviving notes, manuscripts, audio tapes, and news clippings were sent to former ''Today'' researcher Lee Lawrence. Upon Lawrence's death in 2003, the boxes were turned over to the Library of American Broadcasting, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries, where they resided as of 2009.<ref name=papers>{{citation|id={{hdl|1903.1/1488}}|title=Lee Lawrence Papers|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries}}</ref>
