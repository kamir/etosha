==Early life==
Segal was born in [[Great Neck, New York]], the son of Fannie Blanche Segal (née Bodkin) and George Segal, Sr., a malt and hop agent.<ref name=FilmRef>{{cite web|title=George Segal Biography (1934-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/George-Segal.html|work=Film Reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=NYT-Schlemiel-1971>{{cite news |last=Klemesrud |first=Judy |title=He's the Great Schlemiel|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70D12FC3B5F127A93C2A8178AD85F458785F9|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=January 10, 1971}}</ref><ref name=Guardian-FirstAct-2001>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/jul/07/features.weekend | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Sally | last=Vincent | title=Return to the first act | date=July 7, 2001}}</ref> He is the youngest of three sons: oldest brother John, who worked in the hops brokerage business and was an innovator in the cultivation of new hop varieties,<ref name=NYT-John-obit-2005>{{cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths Segal, John B.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7D81139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=January 7, 2005}}</ref> and middle brother Fred, a screenwriter.<ref name=NYT-Schlemiel-1971 /> A six-year-old sister, Greta, died of pneumonia before Segal was born.<ref name=JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013 />

Segal's family was [[Jewish]], but he was raised in a [[Secularism|secular]] household. His ancestors were [[Socialism|socialists]], and one of his paternal great-grandfathers ran for governor of [[Massachusetts]] on the socialist ticket, earning the nickname of "The Young Debs" (for socialist leader [[Eugene V. Debs]]). Segal said his maternal grandmother "ran an anarchist boarding house, where my mother, who was of a Victorian nature, said they would just jump into bed with each other".<ref name=ArtySemite-Forward-2013>{{cite web|last=Schleier|first=Curt|title=The Arty Semite: George Segal on 'The Goldbergs' and Playing Pops Solomon |url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/184063/george-segal-on-the-goldbergs-and-playing-pops-sol/|work=[[The Forward]]|publisher=The Forward Association, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2014|date=September 18, 2013}}</ref> He did not attend religious school.<ref name=JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013 />

When asked if he had a bar mitzvah, Segal stated: "I'm afraid not. I went to a Passover Seder at [[Groucho Marx]]'s once and he kept saying, 'When do we get to the wine?' So that's my Jewish experience. I went to a friend's bar mitzvah, and that was the only time I was in Temple Beth Shalom. Jewish life wasn't happening that much at the time. People's car tires were slashed in front of the temple. I was once kicked down a flight of stairs by some kids from the local parochial school".<ref name=ArtySemite-Forward-2013 />

All of Segal's grandparents were immigrants from [[Russia]].<ref name=JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013>{{cite web|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|title=George Segal on ABC’s ‘The Goldbergs,’ ‘Where’s Poppa?’ and playing Jewish|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/george_segal_on_abcs_the_goldbergs_wheres_poppa_and_playing_jewish|work=Jewish Journal|publisher=Tribe Media Corp.|accessdate=26 January 2014|date=August 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Susskind-JewishSon-1970>{{cite web|title=How to be a Jewish Son—or—My Son the Success! |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/video/article/video_the_david_susskind_show_1970_how_to_be_a_jewish_son_20081202/ |work= [[David Susskind Show]]|accessdate=26 January 2014|page=Season 12 :  Ep. 7|format=video|year=1970}}</ref> His maternal grandparents changed their surname from Slobodkin to Bodkin.<ref name=JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013 /> He first became interested in acting at the age of nine, when he saw [[Alan Ladd]] in ''[[This Gun for Hire]]''.<ref name=Guardian-FirstAct-2001 /> He states: "I started off with the ukulele when I was a kid in Great Neck.

== Career ==
=== Theater ===
After college, Segal got a job as an understudy in a Broadway production of ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''. He said: "The first time I went on stage, it was inspired. The second time was two months later, when I invited an agent and a number of other people to see me in the play. And I was petrified." His performance in the first act was "a disaster", but he said he "made a pact with God" and got through the rest of the play.<ref name=JewishJournal-Goldbergs-2013 /> After serving in the [[United States Army]], he appeared in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' for [[Joseph Papp]] and joined an improvisational group called The Premise, which performed at a [[Bleecker Street]] coffeehouse.<ref name=NYT-JustShoot-1998 /> In 2001, he performed in [[Yasmina Reza]]'s ''[[Art (play)|Art]]'' in his West End debut.<ref name=BBC-Art-2001>{{cite news|title=George Segal joins Art|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1247489.stm|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 January 2014|date=March 28, 2001}}</ref>

Segal was one of the stars of [[Stanley Kramer]]'s acclaimed 1965 drama ''[[Ship of Fools (film)|Ship of Fools]]'', playing an egocentric painter.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Segal appeared frequently on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', nine times as a guest and once as a guest host.

=== Music ===
Segal is an accomplished [[banjo]] player. At Haverford College and Columbia University, he formed Bruno Lynch and his Imperial Jazz Band. Segal also played with a dixieland jazz band while in college at Columbia that had several different names. When he was the one who booked a gig, he would bill the group as Bruno Lynch and his Imperial Jazzband. The group, which later settled on the name Red Onion Jazz Band, later played at his first wedding.<ref name="IGAS"/> In the Army, his band was called Corporal Bruno's Sad Sack Six.<ref name=ChiTrib-Banjo-1993 />

In 1967, Segal released his debut LP, ''The Yama Yama Man''. The title track is a ragtime version of the 1908 tune "[[The Yama Yama Man]]" with horns and banjos. Segal released the album at a time when he appeared regularly playing banjo on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.<ref name=ChiTrib-Banjo-1993>{{cite news|last=Terry|first=Clifford|title=Banjo Pickin' With George Segal|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-04-02/features/9304020150_1_banjo-string-sing|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 2, 1993}}</ref>

In 1974 he played in ''A Touch of Ragtime'', an album with his band, the Imperial Jazzband (which, other than its name, may or may not have had any relation to his college band). During the 1970s and 1980s, Segal made frequent television appearances with the "Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band", whose members included actor [[Conrad Janis]] on trombone. Recent engagements in Los Angeles have included guest spots with the award-winning residency Guitarology.

In addition to playing banjo while appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Segal has played the instrument in several of his acting roles, including several episodes of ''The Goldbergs''.
