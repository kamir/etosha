==Plot==
At [[Middlebury College]] in 1969, four young friends, Elise Elliot ([[Goldie Hawn]]), Brenda Morelli (Bette Midler), Annie MacDuggan (Diane Keaton), and Cynthia Swann (Stockard Channing), are graduating. As graduation gifts, valedictorian Cynthia presents the girls with matching [[Bulgari]] pearl necklaces. As the graduates take a commemorative picture of the four of them (presumably for the last time), Cynthia makes Annie, Brenda and Elise promise that they will always be there for each other throughout the remainder of their lives.

In the present time, the four friends eventually lose touch with one another, as evident when Cynthia ([[Stockard Channing]]) is tearfully gazing at the picture of the four of them on that graduation day. Now wealthy and living in a luxurious penthouse, she gives her maid her own Bulgari pearl necklace (matching the three she gave to her friends on graduation day), and has the maid mail letters to them. She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur coat, a cigarette and a drink, and then commits suicide by jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger mistress the day before.

Her former friends aren't doing much better: Brenda ([[Bette Midler]]) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise ([[Goldie Hawn]]), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Annie ([[Diane Keaton]]), meanwhile, is separated, suffering extreme self-esteem issues, and going through therapy with her husband. Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited for the first time since college, Annie's husband, Aaron ([[Stephen Collins]]), leaves her for her younger therapist ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty ([[Dan Hedaya]]) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill ([[Victor Garber]]), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letter that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After all three read their letter from Cynthia and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris ([[Jennifer Dundas]]) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.

Brenda finds out through her uncle Carmine ([[Philip Bosco]]) who has Mafia connections that Morty is guilty of income tax fraud, while Annie makes a plan to revive her advertising career and buy out Aaron's partners. However, as their plan moves through, things start to fall apart when they find out that Bill has no checkered past and nothing for them to use against him. Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]) is actually a minor.

Deciding that revenge would make them no better than their husbands, they instead use these situations to push their men into funding the establishment of a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia. The film ends with a celebration at the new Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women. Annie narrates that Elise started a relationship with a cast member in her new, successful play, that Brenda and Morty reconciled their differences and got back together, and that when Aaron tried to get back together with her, Annie told him to "drop dead." While outside the center Bill meets Shelly and the two start to flirt. The film concludes with the three women joyfully singing [[Lesley Gore]]'s hit ''[[You Don't Own Me]]''.

==Cast==
* [[Diane Keaton]] as Annie MacDuggan Paradis, the vehicle for the film's sporadic [[voice-over]]; an anxious and slightly [[neuroticism|neurotic]] housewife, saddled with self-esteem problems, attempting to save her marriage with estranged husband Aaron – much to her daughter's dismay.
* [[Bette Midler]] as Brenda Morelli Cushman, a wise-cracking Sicilian-[[Jewish]] single mother who helped set her husband Morty on his feet financially, before he left her for the much younger Shelly, cheating her out of an equitable settlement.
* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Elise Elliot Atchison, a former one-time [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning actress, now an [[alcoholic]] and heavy smoker relegated to [[B movie]]s due to her 'unprofitable' age. Her husband, Bill, who left her for another woman, is suing for alimony and insisting that all of their joint assets be sold and the profits divided between them.
* [[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Phoebe LaVelle, an up-and-coming actress, living with Bill. She presumably tells him that she is twenty-one, but Elise tricks him and reveals that she is sixteen years old and a high school dropout.
* [[Stockard Channing]] as Cynthia Swann Griffin, a [[college]] friend of the three main protagonists, who commits [[suicide]] after her husband, Gil, betrays and eventually divorces her.
* [[Stephen Collins]] as Aaron Paradis, Annie's conflicted husband and [[CEO]] of an advertising agency, who leaves his wife for their therapist, Leslie Rosen.
* [[Victor Garber]] as Bill Atchison, a successful [[film producer]], who rose to fame through Elise's connections and eventually left her in favor of a young [[Actress|starlet]].
* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Dr. Leslie Rosen, Aaron's short-time affair, who is the therapist for both Annie and Aaron. Leslie has been "helping" Annie with her self-esteem problems.
* [[Eileen Heckart]] as Catherine MacDuggan, Annie's 'controlling' mother.
* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Brenda's ex-husband Morton 'Morty' Cushman, an [[electronics]] [[tycoon]], who hides his wealth and takes advantage of having his former wife having signed an out-of-court settlement - just to finance his fiancée's preferences.
* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Shelly Stewart, Morty's dim-witted but manipulative fiancée. This is Parker's second film with Midler as her co-star, the first being the 1993 Disney film ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]''.
* [[Bronson Pinchot]] as Duarto Felice, Brenda's boss and (according to Annie) "one of the ten worst interior decorators in New York."
* [[Maggie Smith]] as Gunilla Garson Goldberg, a wealthy [[New York]] [[society]] leader who helps the First Wives Club along with their schemes because she was once a first wife, as well as a "second, third and fourth wife", according to Annie.
* [[Jennifer Dundas]] as Christine "Chris" Paradis, Annie's [[lesbian]] and [[feminist]] daughter, who resents her father for what he is putting her mother through. This is the second film in which Dundas plays Keaton's daughter, having previously done so in ''[[Mrs. Soffel]]''.
* [[Ari Greenberg]] as Jason Cushman, Brenda's son, who is caught in an emotional battle between his parents.
* [[Philip Bosco]] as Uncle Carmine Morelli, Brenda's paternal uncle and part of her family's Sicilian [[mafia]] connections.

===Writing===
The film project originally belonged to [[Sherry Lansing]], who bought the unpublished manuscript of the novel in 1991, after many publishers had rejected it, and handed it over to producer [[Scott Rudin]] when she became [[CEO]] of [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1992.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/24/movies/appeal-of-a-woman-s-revenge.html | work=The New York Times | title=Appeal of a Woman's Revenge | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=September 24, 1996 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> "It was one of the single best ideas for a movie I've ever heard," she said in a 1996 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''.

[[Diane Keaton]] was the first reported to have landed one of the starring roles, having previously worked with Rudin on the films ''[[Mrs. Soffel]]'' and ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'', followed by [[Bette Midler]] who had originally auditioned for the "more glamorous role" of Elise.<ref>{{cite news|first=Pauline|last=McLeod|title=My First For Renvenge; Berre Midler Knows Exactly Hoe To Get|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=FindArticles|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19961103/ai_n14456412/|date=1996-11-03|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> Although Rudin originally intended to cast [[Jessica Lange]] in the latter role, the team decided to rewrite the character of the book in favour of a "glitzier" version which eventually went to eleventh-hour addition [[Goldie Hawn]].<ref name="imdb"/> Actor [[Mandy Patinkin]] dropped out shortly before shooting started and was replaced by [[Stephen Collins (actor)|Stephen Collins]] when he decided to leave the project in favour of his musical ambitions,<ref>{{cite news|first=Dennis|last= Michael|title=The Hollywood Minute|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/HWMin/9512/12-02/index.html|date=1995-12-02|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> while [[Dan Hedaya]] won the role of Morty over [[Hector Elizondo]].<ref name="var">{{cite news|first=Army|last=Archerd|title=Only dirt in Carradine autobio is on him|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862810.html |date=1995-11-05|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Berkley]] only took her part to "work with the best actresses around,"<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F73D6A6D851C77B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "Five Questions with...Elizabeth Berkley"], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', October 31, 2002</ref> and [[Timothy Olyphant]], who had impressed with local stage work, made his screen debut as director Brett Artounian in the film.<ref name="var" />

Production designer Peter Larkin took much inspiration from [[Hollywood]]'s [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] of the [[1930s in film|1930s]], incorporating a post-[[Great Depression]] view on style and luxury, widely popularized through these films.

==Release==

===Reception===
The film has received mixed reviews by critics. The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 39% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 33 reviews, with an average score of 5.4/10.<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Wives Club (1996) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_wives_club/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which uses a normalized rating system, the film holds a 58/100 rating, indicating "mixed or average reviews" based on 21 critics.<ref>{{metacritic film|http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-first-wives-club|The First Wives Club|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref>

Edward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called that the film a "terrific comedy" and "a glamorous revenge romp, a ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' mixed with ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]''", giving "each star the opportunity to do her best work in a long, long time." He added that "what's surprising isn't that each of them is so delightfully good but that they work together so well."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Wives-Get-Even-and-Even-More-2965784.php#ixzz2Iba85Wy0|first=Edward|last=Guthmann|title=Wives' Get Even and Even More|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=1996-09-20|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> In his review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Leonard Klady found that director "Hugh Wilson wisely gets out of the way of his performers, providing a simple glossy look enhanced by cameraman Donald Thorin, designer [[Peter Larkin (designer)|Peter Larkin]] and the costumes of [[Theoni V. Aldredge]]". He noted that "with its combination of comic zingers and star turns, [the] pic shapes up as one of the more commercial fall [1996] entries", that "at its core, is a celebration of its star trio as consummate performers. In that respect, ''First Wives Club'' is a highly enjoyable movie romp."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911107/?categoryid=31&cs=1|first=Leonard|last=lady |title=The First Wives Club|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1996-09-15|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref>

[[Janet Maslin]] from ''[[New York Times]]'' remarked that the film "freely overhauls the amusing beach book by Olivia Goldsmith, eliminating the sex, adding more slapstick and tailoring the leading roles to suit three divas in starring roles." While she felt that "Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn make a spirited, surprisingly harmonious trio," reeling off "one-liners with accomplished flair, even when the film turns silly and begins to, pardon the expression, sag", she found that the film fared "better with sight gags and quick retorts than with plot development".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/first_wives_club.html|first=Janet|last=Maslin|title=The First Wives Club|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1996-09-20|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave ''The First Wives Club'' two out of four stars. He declared the film "heavy on incident but light on plot", filled with "heartfelt talks with slapstick and sitcom situations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960920/REVIEWS/609200301|first=Roger |last=Ebert|title=The First Wives Club|publisher=RogertEbert.com|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=1996-09-20|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]], writer for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', wrote that "paced like a [[Chris Farley]] movie and photographed like a denture-cream commercial, ''The First Wives Club'' is the sort of overbright plastic-package comedy that tends to live or die by its jokes, its farcical audacity — anything but its 'conviction'." He gave the film a C+ rating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294272,00.html|first=Roger |last=Ebert|title=The First Wives Club (1996)|publisher=EW.com|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1996-09-27|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref>

But I think we should all do it for the same amount of money.' Now, if there were three men that came back to do a sequel, they would have paid them three times their salary at least." On February 25, 2011, Goldie Hawn posted a picture on Twitter of the three at a lunch confirming that they had all signed on for a sequel, and the next day re-tweeted a message from Bravo TV confirming this again.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/goldie_hawn_is_tired_of_hollywood_s_sexi Goldie Hawn Is Tired Of Hollywood's Sexism - Starpulse Entertainment News Blog]</ref>
