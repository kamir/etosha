Winfrey was born into poverty in rural [[Mississippi]] to a teenage single mother and later raised in an inner-city [[Milwaukee]] neighborhood. She experienced considerable hardship during her childhood, saying she was raped at age nine and became pregnant at 14; her son died in infancy.<ref name = "path to power"/> Sent to live with the man she calls her father, a barber in [[Tennessee]], Winfrey landed a job in radio while still in high school and began co-anchoring the local evening news at the age of 19.

==Early life==
Winfrey was named "Orpah" after the [[Orpah|biblical character]] in the [[Book of Ruth]] on her birth certificate, but people mispronounced it regularly and "Oprah" stuck.<ref name="A of A"/>

Winfrey was born in [[Kosciusko, Mississippi]], to an unmarried teenage mother. She later said that her conception was due to a single sexual encounter and the couple broke up not long after.<ref>Jill Nelson, "The Man Who Saved Oprah Winfrey", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 14, 1981; p. W30</ref> Her mother, Vernita Lee (born c. 1935), was a housemaid. Winfrey's biological father is usually noted as Vernon Winfrey (born 1933), a coal miner turned barber turned city councilman who had been in the Armed Forces when she was born. However, Mississippi farmer and World War II veteran Noah Robinson, Sr. (born c. 1925) has claimed to be her biological father.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/17/dirt-poor-mississippi-farmer-claims-hes-oprahs-dad/?test=faces|publisher=Fox News|title=Poor Mississippi Farmer Claims He's Oprah's Dad|date=April 17, 2010}}</ref> A [[genetic test]] in 2006 determined that her matrilineal line originated among the [[Kpelle people|Kpelle]] ethnic group, in the area that today is [[Liberia]]. Her genetic makeup was determined to be 89% Sub-Saharan African, 8% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and 3% East Asian. However, the East Asian may, given the imprecisions of genetic testing, actually be Native American markers.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=eUs0iUjQyzQC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=oprah+8%25+native+american#v=onepage&q=oprah%208%25%20native%20american&f=false] ''Finding Oprah's Roots: Finding Your Own'', by Henry Louis Gates, page 154, at Google Books</ref>

After Winfrey's birth, her mother traveled north and Winfrey spent her first six years living in rural poverty with her maternal grandmother, Hattie Mae (Presley) Lee (April 15, 1900 – February 27, 1963), who was so poor that Winfrey often wore dresses made of potato sacks, for which the local children made fun of her.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/nov/20/television.usa "You go, girl" "The Observer Profile: Oprah Winfrey" ] ''The Observer'' (UK), November 20, 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogy.about.com/od/aframertrees/p/oprah_winfrey.htm |title=Ancestry of Oprah Winfrey |publisher=Genealogy.about.com |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref> Her grandmother taught her to read before the age of three and took her to the local church, where she was nicknamed "The Preacher" for her ability to recite Bible verses. When Winfrey was a child, her grandmother would hit her with a stick when she did not do chores or if she misbehaved in any way.<ref>Krohn, Katherine E, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NttdSpnjedgC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=oprah+grandmother+hit+switch&source=bl&ots=wb9LF9oSVi&sig=jfgRUaTv2UouCrTo-9o0GosdcEM&hl=en#v=onepage&q=oprah%20grandmother%20hit%20switch&f=false ''Oprah Winfrey: Global Media Leader (USA Today)''], (Krohn, 2002), ISBN 978-1-58013-571-9, p. 9</ref>

At age six, Winfrey moved to an inner-city neighborhood in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin with her mother Vernita Lee, who was less supportive and encouraging than her grandmother had been, largely as a result of the long hours she worked as a maid.<ref>Jill Nelson. "The Man Who Saved Oprah Winfrey." ''Washington Post'', December 14, 1986, p. W30</ref> Around this time, Lee had given birth to another daughter, Winfrey's younger half-sister, Patricia<ref name="Mair pg 12">Mair (1999) pg 12</ref> who later (in February 2003, at age 43) died of causes related to [[cocaine]] addiction.<ref name=Garson20>Garson, Helen S.

She began to steal money from her mother in an effort to keep up with her free-spending peers, to lie to and argue with her mother, and to go out with older boys.<ref>Nagle, Jeanne M.

Her frustrated mother once again sent her to live with Vernon in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, though this time she did not take her back. Vernon was strict, but encouraging, and made her education a priority. Winfrey became an honors student, was voted Most Popular Girl, and joined her high school speech team at [[East Nashville High School]], placing second in the nation in dramatic interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/oprah-winfrey.html|title=Biography.com|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref> She won an oratory contest, which secured her a full scholarship to [[Tennessee State University]], a [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black institution]], where she studied communication.

Winfrey's career choice in media would not have surprised her grandmother, who once said that ever since Winfrey could talk, she was on stage. As a child, she played games interviewing her corncob doll and the crows on the fence of her family's property. Winfrey later acknowledged her grandmother's influence, saying it was Hattie Mae who had encouraged her to speak in public and "gave me a positive sense of myself".<ref>Mel Novit.

She was then recruited to join [[Richard Sher (newscaster)|Richard Sher]] as co-host of WJZ's local talk show ''People Are Talking'', which premiered on August 14, 1978.

[[File:Oprahfirst.jpg|thumb|left|Winfrey on the first national broadcast of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in 1986]]

In 1983, Winfrey relocated to Chicago to host [[WLS-TV]]'s low-rated half-hour morning talk show, ''AM Chicago''. The first episode aired on January 2, 1984. Within months after Winfrey took over, the show went from last place in the ratings to overtaking ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'' as the highest rated talk show in Chicago. The movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] persuaded her to sign a syndication deal with [[King World]]. Ebert predicted that she would generate 40 times as much revenue as his television show, ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies]]''.<ref name="Ebert">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=How I gave Oprah her start |work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 16, 2005|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051116/COMMENTARY/511160301|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}</ref> It was renamed ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', expanded to a full hour, and broadcast nationally beginning September 8, 1986.<ref Name="Who ...

Their much publicized contest was the subject of enormous scrutiny. ''TIME'' magazine wrote:
{{cquote|Few people would have bet on Oprah Winfrey's swift rise to host of the most popular talk show on TV. In a field dominated by white males, she is a black female of ample bulk. As interviewers go, she is no match for, say, Phil Donahue [...] What she lacks in journalistic toughness, she makes up for in plainspoken curiosity, robust humor and, above all empathy. Guests with sad stories to tell are apt to rouse a tear in Oprah's eye [...] They, in turn, often find themselves revealing things they would not imagine telling anyone, much less a national TV audience. It is the talk show as a group therapy session.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968069,00.html "Oprah Winfrey: Lady with a Calling" 8 August 1988. ''Time Magazine''.] Accessed 2010-19-17</ref>}}

TV columnist [[Howard Rosenberg]] said, "She's a roundhouse, a full course meal, big, brassy, loud, aggressive, hyper, laughable, lovable, soulful, tender, low-down, earthy and hungry. And she may know the way to Phil Donahue's jugular."<ref Name="Mair9798">Mair, George (2001) p. 97</ref> ''[[Newsday]]'''s [[Les Payne]] observed, "Oprah Winfrey is sharper than Donahue, wittier, more genuine, and far better attuned to her audience, if not the world"<ref Name="Mair9798"/> and Martha Bayles of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote, "It's a relief to see a gab-monger with a fond but realistic assessment of her own cultural and religious roots."<ref Name="Mair9798"/>

In the early years of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', the program was classified as a tabloid talk show. In the mid-1990s, Winfrey adopted a less tabloid-oriented format, hosting shows on broader topics such as heart disease, geopolitics, spirituality and meditation, interviewing celebrities on social issues they were directly involved with, such as cancer, charity work, or substance abuse, and hosting televised giveaways including shows where every audience member received a new car (donated by General Motors) or a trip to Australia (donated by Australian tourism bodies).<ref name="When Oprah gives, someone else pays">{{cite news|title=When Oprah gives, someone else pays|publisher=theage.com.au|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/when-oprah-gives-someone-else-pays-20110121-1a012.html|accessdate=January 22, 2011|location=Melbourne|date=January 22, 2011}}</ref>
In addition to her talk show, Winfrey also produced and co-starred in the 1989 drama miniseries [[The Women of Brewster Place (TV miniseries)|''The Women of Brewster Place'']], as well as a short-lived spin-off, ''Brewster Place''. As well as hosting and appearing on television shows, Winfrey co-founded the women's cable television network ''[[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]''. She is also the president of [[Harpo Productions]] (''Oprah'' spelled backwards). On January 15, 2008, Winfrey and [[Discovery Communications]] announced plans to change [[Discovery Health Channel]] into a new channel called ''[[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]]''. It was scheduled to launch in 2009, but was delayed, and actually launched on January 1, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/own/what_is_own.html/|title=What is OWN|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=August 26, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

===Celebrity interviews===
In 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare prime-time interview with [[Michael Jackson]], which became the fourth most watched event in American television history as well as the most watched interview ever, with an audience of 36.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Company, Johnson Publishing|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rLoDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA37&dq=Queen%20cbs&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alex Haley's 'Queen' Lifts CBS To No. 1|journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=March 8, 1993|accessdate=February 23, 2011|page=37}}</ref> On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to promote the new Broadway musical ''[[The Color Purple]]'',<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/oprah_winfrey/biography/0,,20006996_10,00.htmll ''People Magazine (US)]{{dead link|date=May 2011}} {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> of which she was a producer, joining [[David Letterman|the host]] for the first time in 16 years.

"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening", said Winfrey. On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', as its season premiere was filmed in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/29/AR2007082902013.html|title=Letterman to Appear on 'Oprah'|agency=Associated Press|date=August 29, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2010|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

In 2006, rappers [[Ludacris]], [[50 Cent]] and [[Ice Cube]] criticized Winfrey for what they perceived as an anti-[[hip hop music|hip hop]] bias. In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a "hard time" about his lyrics, and edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of the film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]''. He also said that he wasn't initially invited on the show with the rest of the cast.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197184,00.html "Ice Cube Says Oprah Has 'a Problem With Hip-Hop"].

She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. In September 2008, Winfrey received criticism after [[Matt Drudge]] of the ''[[Drudge Report]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Bercovici|first=Jeff|url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2008/09/07/oprah-and-sarah-anatomy-of-a-non-troversy|title=Oprah and Sarah: Anatomy of a Non-troversy|publisher=Portfolio.com|date=September 7, 2008|accessdate=November 30, 2008}}</ref> reported that Winfrey refused to have [[Sarah Palin]] on her show, allegedly because of Winfrey's support for Barack Obama.<ref name="palin">{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=5736716&page=1|title=Is Oprah Biased?

===Film===
[[File:The color purple oprah winfrey.jpg|thumb|Winfrey as Sofia in ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]''.]]
In 1985, Winfrey co-starred in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' as distraught housewife, [[The Color Purple#Sofia|Sofia]]. She was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance. The film went on to become [[The Color Purple (musical)|a Broadway musical]] which opened in late 2005, with Winfrey credited as a producer. In October 1998, Winfrey produced and starred in the film ''[[Beloved (film)|Beloved]]'', based on [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Beloved (novel)|novel of the same name]]. To prepare for her role as Sethe, the protagonist and former slave, Winfrey experienced a 24-hour simulation of the experience of slavery, which included being tied up and blindfolded and left alone in the woods. Despite major advertising, including two episodes of her [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|talk show]] dedicated solely to the film, and moderate to good critical reviews, ''Beloved'' opened to poor box-office results, losing approximately $30&nbsp;million. While promoting the movie, co-star [[Thandie Newton]] described Winfrey as "a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart. She's acute. She's got a mind like a razor blade."<ref>''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' October 1998</ref> In 2005, [[Harpo Productions]] released a film adaptation of [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s 1937 novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''. [[Their Eyes Were Watching God (film)|The made-for-television film]] was based upon a teleplay by [[Suzan-Lori Parks]], and starred [[Halle Berry]] in the lead female role.

In late 2008, Winfrey's company [[Harpo Films]] signed an exclusive output pact to develop and produce scripted series, documentaries and movies for [[HBO]].<ref name="varietyHBOpact">{{cite news|last=Frankel| first=Daniel| title=Oprah Winfrey pacts with HBO|newspaper=Variety|date=December 16, 2008|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997464.html?categoryid=14&cs=1}}</ref> Oprah voiced Gussie the goose for ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'' (2006) and the voice of Judge Bumbleden in ''[[Bee Movie]]'' (2007) co-starring the voices of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Renée Zellweger]]. In 2009, Winfrey provided the voice for the character of Eudora, the mother of [[Princess Tiana]], in Disney's ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' and in 2010, narrated the US version of the [[BBC]] nature program ''[[Life (BBC TV series)|Life]]'' for Discovery.

===Homes===
[[File:OprahEstate.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Oprah's [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] estate]]
Winfrey currently lives on "The Promised Land", her 42-acre (170,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) estate with ocean and mountain views in [[Montecito, California]]. Winfrey also owns a house in [[Lavallette, New Jersey]]; an apartment in Chicago; an estate on [[Fisher Island, Florida]]; a ski house in [[Telluride, Colorado]]; and property on [[Maui]], Hawaii and [[Antigua]]. Her base during filming of Winfrey's show is Chicago, so she spends time in the neighborhood of [[Streeterville]].

===Romantic history===
A self-described promiscuous teen who was a victim of sexual abuse, Winfrey gave birth at the age of 14 to a boy who died shortly after.<ref name="path to power">{{cite news|last=Mowbray|first=Nicole|title=Oprah's path to power|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=March 2, 2003|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/mar/02/pressandpublishing.usnews1|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}</ref>

Winfrey's high school sweetheart Anthony Otey recalled an innocent courtship that began in Winfrey's senior year of high school, from which he saved hundreds of love notes; Winfrey conducted herself with dignity and as a model student.<ref name="Mair pg 28-29">Mair (1999) pp. 28–29</ref> The two spoke of getting married, but Otey claimed to have always secretly known that Winfrey was destined for a far greater life than he could ever provide.<ref name="Mair pg 30">Mair (1999) p. 30</ref> She broke up with him on Valentine's Day of her senior year.<ref name="Mair pg 30" /><ref name="Mair pg 31">Mair (1999) p. 31</ref>

In 1971, several months after breaking up with Otey, Winfrey met William "Bubba" Taylor at Tennessee State University. According to CBS journalist [[George Mair]], Taylor was Winfrey's "first intense, to die for love affair". Winfrey helped get Taylor a job at WVOL, and according to Mair, "did everything to keep him, including literally begging him on her knees to stay with her."<ref name="Mair pg 33">Mair (1999) p. 33</ref> Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976. "We really did care for each other", Winfrey would later recall. "We shared a deep love. A love I will never forget."<ref name="Mair pg 43">Mair (1999), p. 43.</ref>

In the 1970s, Winfrey had a romantic relationship with [[John Tesh]].<ref>Tesh told the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', "Oprah and I were cub reporters in Nashville nearly 40 years ago and we dated for a short time. We remain friends to this day."{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}</ref> Biographer [[Kitty Kelley]] claims that Tesh split with Winfrey over the pressure of having an interracial relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/12/oprah-john-tesh-briefly-dated-lived-toger-new-book-claims/?test=faces|publisher=Fox News|title=Oprah and John Tesh Briefly Dated, Lived Together, New Book Claims|date=April 12, 2010}}</ref>

When WJZ-TV management criticized Winfrey for crying on the air while reporting tragedies and were unhappy with her physical appearance (especially when her hair fell out as the result of a bad perm), Winfrey turned to reporter Lloyd Kramer for comfort. "Lloyd was just the best", Winfrey would later recall. "That man loved me even when I was bald! He was wonderful. He stuck with me through the whole demoralizing experience. That man was the most fun romance I ever had."<ref name="Mair pg 47">{{cite book|last=Mair|first=George|title=Oprah Winfrey: The Real Story|page=47|year=1995|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|isbn=1-55972-250-9}}</ref>

According to Mair, when Kramer moved to NBC in New York, Winfrey had a love affair with a married man who had no intention of leaving his wife.<ref name="Mair pg 49">"the major problem with this intense love affair arose from her lover's being married, with no plans to leave his wife"</ref> Winfrey would later recall: "I'd had a relationship with a man for four years. I wasn't living with him. I'd never lived with anyone—and I thought I was worthless without him. The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him. I felt depleted, powerless. At the end I was down on the floor on my knees groveling and pleading with him".<ref name="Mair pg 49" /> Winfrey became so depressed that on September 8, 1981, she wrote a suicide note to best friend Gayle King instructing King to water her plants.<ref name="Mair pg 49">Mair (1999)p. 49</ref> "That suicide note had been much overplayed" Winfrey told ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine. "I couldn't kill myself. I would be afraid the minute I did it; something really good would happen and I'd miss it."<ref Name="Mair p50">Mair (1999) p. 50</ref>

According to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: "The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much. I needed everyone to like me, because I didn't like myself much. So I'd end up with these cruel self-absorbed guys who'd tell me how selfish I was, and I'd say 'Oh thank you, you're so right' and be grateful to them. Because I had no sense that I deserved anything else. Which is also why I gained so much weight later on. It was the perfect way of cushioning myself against the world's disapproval."<ref Name="Mair p50"/>

Winfrey later confessed to smoking [[crack cocaine]] with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era. She explained on her show: "I always felt that the drug itself is not the problem but that I was addicted to the man." She added: "I can't think of anything I wouldn't have done for that man."<ref name="Jet">{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n12_v87/ai_16404541|title=Oprah reveals on her show she smoked crack cocaine during her 20s|publisher=Jet|date=January 30, 1995|accessdate=August 25, 2008}} Archived at FindArticles in 2004.</ref>

Winfrey was allegedly involved in a second drug-related love affair. Self-proclaimed former boyfriend Randoph Cook said they lived together for several months in 1985 and did drugs.

Also, in the mid-1980s, Winfrey briefly dated movie critic [[Roger Ebert]], whom she credits with advising her to take her show into syndication.<ref name="Ebert"/>

In 1985, before Winfrey's Chicago talk show had gone national, Haitian filmmaker Reginald Chevalier claims he appeared as a guest on a look-alike segment and began a relationship with Winfrey involving romantic evenings at home, candlelit baths, and dinners with [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Danny Glover]]. Chevalier says Winfrey ended the relationship when she met Stedman Graham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/02/exclusive-interview-stedman-stole-oprah-me-secret-lover-tells-radar|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Stedman Stole Oprah From Me, Secret Lover Tells Radar|date=February 17, 2011|publisher=radaronline.com|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>

===Close friends===
[[File:Oprah Winfrey (2004).jpg|alt=|thumb|Winfrey celebrating her 50th birthday among friends at her Santa Barbara estate]]
Winfrey's best friend since their early twenties is [[Gayle King]]. King was formerly the host of ''The Gayle King Show'' and is currently an editor of ''O, the Oprah Magazine''. Since 1997, when Winfrey played the therapist on an episode of the sitcom ''Ellen'' in which [[Ellen DeGeneres]] came out of the closet, Winfrey and King have been the target of persistent rumors that they were gay. "I understand why people think we're gay", Winfrey says in the August 2006 issue of ''O'' magazine. "There isn't a definition in our culture for this kind of bond between women.

===Personal wealth===
Born in rural poverty, then raised by a mother on welfare in a poor urban neighborhood, Winfrey became a millionaire at age 32 when her talk show went national. Winfrey was in a position to negotiate ownership of the show and start her own production company because of the success and the amount of revenue the show generated. At age 41, Winfrey had a net worth of $340&nbsp;million and replaced [[Bill Cosby]] as the only African American on the [[Forbes 400]].<ref name="time.com">{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Dan|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1939458_1939454_1939448,00.html|title=7.

Columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] seems to agree with such assessments: "She is the top alpha female in this country. She has more credibility than the president.

In 2005, Winfrey was named the greatest woman in American history as part of a public poll as part of ''[[The Greatest American]]''. She was ranked No. 9 overall on the list of greatest Americans.  However polls estimating Winfrey's personal popularity have been inconsistent. A November 2003 Gallup poll estimated that 73% of American adults had a favorable view of Winfrey. Another Gallup poll in January 2007 estimated the figure at 74%, although it dropped to 66% when Gallup conducted the same poll in October 2007. A December 2007 Fox News poll put the figure at 55%.<ref>{{cite web|author=Costas Panagopoulos|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9427_Page2.html|title=Obama supporter Oprah takes a big dive – Costas Panagopoulos|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=November 30, 2008}}</ref> According to [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll|Gallup's annual most admired poll]], Americans consistently rank Winfrey as one of the most admired women in the world.

==="Oprahfication"===
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' coined the term "Oprahfication", meaning public confession as a form of therapy.<ref Name="Church of O">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/april1/1.38.html "The Church of O" ''Christianity Today'' April 1, 2002]. Accessed August 26, 2010</ref> By confessing intimate details about her weight problems, tumultuous love life, and sexual abuse, and crying alongside her guests, ''Time'' magazine credits Winfrey with creating a new form of media communication known as "rapport talk" as distinguished from the "report talk" of Phil Donahue: "Winfrey saw television's power to blend public and private; while it links strangers and conveys information over public airwaves, TV is most often viewed in the privacy of our homes. Like a family member, it sits down to meals with us and talks to us in the lonely afternoons. Grasping this paradox, ...She makes people care because she cares. That is Winfrey's genius, and will be her legacy, as the changes she has wrought in the talk show continue to permeate our culture and shape our lives."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988512-2,00.html ''Time'' article June 8, 1998. "The TV Host".] Accessed September 17, 2010</ref>

Observers have also noted the "Oprahfication" of politics such as "Oprah-style debates" and [[Bill Clinton]] being described as "the man who brought Oprah-style psychobabble and misty confessions to politics."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/06/1019441475691.html|title=Clinton as TV host?

The November 1988 ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' observed that "in a society where fat is taboo, she made it in a medium that worships thin and celebrates a bland, white-bread prettiness of body and personality [...] But Winfrey made fat sexy, elegant – damned near gorgeous – with her drop-dead wardrobe, easy body language, and cheerful sensuality."<ref>Kelley, Kitty.

====Mainstream acceptance of gays====
While [[Phil Donahue]] has been credited with pioneering the tabloid talk show genre, Winfrey's warmth, intimacy and personal confession popularized and changed it.<ref name="TIME 100 1998" /><ref name="Coming Afer Oprah">{{cite press release|title=Coming After Oprah|publisher=Dr. Leonard Mustazza|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/l/x/lxm7/oprah.html|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}</ref> Her success at popularizing of the tabloid talk show genre had opened up a thriving industry that has included ''[[Ricki Lake (TV series)|Ricki Lake]]'', ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]'', and ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''. Sociologists such as Vicki Abt criticized tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book ''Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV talk show'', Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Winfrey's success was blurring the lines between "normal" and "deviant" behavior. In the book ''Freaks Talk Back'',<ref name="FTB UCPress"/> Yale sociology professor [[Joshua Gamson]] credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transsexual]], and [[transgender]] (LGBT) people and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review [[Michael Bronski]] wrote, "In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'', ''[[The Jenny Jones Show|Jenny Jones]]'', ''Oprah'', and ''[[Geraldo Rivera|Geraldo]]'', people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week."<ref name="FTP Amazon">Gamson, Joshua (1999) University Of Chicago Press ISBN 0-226-28065-9</ref> Gamson credits the tabloid talk show with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a ''Time'' magazine article describing early 21st century gays coming out of the closet younger and younger and gay suicide rates plummeting. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused gays to be embraced on more traditional forms of media. Examples include sitcoms like ''[[Will & Grace]]'', primetime shows like ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' and Oscar nominated feature films like ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' and ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''.

During a show in 1988, members of the studio audience stood up one by one, gave their name and announced that they were gay in observance of [[National Coming Out Day]]. Also in the 1980s Winfrey took her show to West Virginia to confront a town gripped by AIDS paranoia because a gay man living in the town had HIV. Winfrey interviewed the man who had become a social outcast and the town's mayor who drained a swimming pool in which the man had gone swimming, and debated with the town's hostile residents. "But I hear this is a God fearing town", Winfrey scolded the homophobic studio audience; "where's all that Christian love and understanding?" During a show on gay marriage in the 1990s, a woman in Winfrey's audience stood up to complain that gays were constantly flaunting their sex lives and she announced that she was tired of it. "You know what I'm tired of", replied Winfrey, "heterosexual males raping and sodomizing young girls. That's what I'm tired of." Her rebuttal inspired a screaming standing ovation from that show's studio audience.

Winfrey promotes openly gay celebrities on her show, such as her hairdresser [[Andre Walker]], makeup artist Reggie Wells, and decorator [[Nate Berkus]], who inspired an outpouring of sympathy from middle America after grieving the loss of his partner in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] on the show. In April 1997, Winfrey played the therapist in "[[The Puppy Episode]]" on the sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' to whom the character (and the real-life [[Ellen DeGeneres]]) said she was a lesbian. In 1998, [[Mark Steyn]] in the ''[[National Review]]'' wrote of Winfrey, "Today, no truly epochal moment in the history of the Republic occurs unless it is validated by her presence. When Ellen said, 'Yep! I'm gay,' Oprah was by her side, guesting on the sitcom as (what else?) the star's therapist."

==="The Oprah Effect"===
The power of Winfrey's opinions and endorsement to influence public opinion, especially consumer purchasing choices, has been dubbed "The Oprah Effect".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/29961298/|title=The Oprah Effect|last=Quintanilla|first=Carlos|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> The effect has been documented or alleged in domains as diverse as book sales, beef markets, and election voting. Late in 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/pastselections/20080701_orig_list|title=Oprah's Book Club Archive|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> Winfrey introduced the [[Oprah's Book Club]] segment to her television show. The segment focused on new books and classics and often brought obscure novels to popular attention. The book club became such a powerful force that whenever Winfrey introduced a new book as her book-club selection, it instantly became a best-seller; for example, when she selected the classic [[John Steinbeck]] novel ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', it soared to the top of the book charts. Being recognized by Winfrey often means a million additional book sales for an author.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/23/books/23oprah.html?scp=1&sq=%22oprah%27s+book+club%22&st=nyt "Oprah's Book Club to Add Contemporary Writers"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' article. September 23, 2005. Accessed September 18, 2010</ref> In ''Reading with Oprah: The Book Club that Changed America'' (2005), Kathleen Rooney describes Winfrey as "a serious American intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and the Internet, to take reading – a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act – and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books."

When author [[Jonathan Franzen]]'s book was selected for the Book Club, he reportedly "cringed" and said selected books tend to be "schmaltzy".<ref>{{cite web|last=Elliot|first=Jane|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/article/franzen|title=Jonathan Franzen and Oprah|publisher=Bitchmagazine.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> After [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' was found to contain fabrications in 2006, Winfrey confronted him on her show over the breach of trust.

Texas cattlemen sued her and Lyman in early 1998 for "false defamation of perishable food" and "business disparagement", claiming that Winfrey's remarks sent cattle prices tumbling, costing beef producers $11&nbsp;million. Winfrey was represented by attorney [[Chip Babcock]] and, on February 26, after a two-month trial in an [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], Texas court, a jury found Winfrey and Lyman were not liable for damages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oprah: 'Free speech rocks'|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9802/26/oprah.verdict/|publisher=CNN|date=February 26, 1998|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091006060345/http://www.cnn.com/US/9802/26/oprah.verdict/|archivedate=October 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sandusky jury has strong Penn State ties |author=Susan Snyder |author2=Jeremy Roebuck |url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-06-09/news/32125098_1_judge-john-m-cleland-jury-room-sandusky-jury |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=June 9, 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> During the lawsuit, Winfrey hired [[Phil McGraw]]'s company [[Phil McGraw#Oprah Winfrey and the Dr. Phil show|Courtroom Sciences, Inc.]] to help her analyze and read the jury.<ref>[http://networthcity.com/oprah-winfrey-net-worth/ Oprah Winfrey Net Worth – From Abused Little Girl to a Powerful Woman], NetWorthCity.com.

===Spiritual leadership===
In 2000, she was awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] from the [[NAACP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners |title=NAACP Spingarn Medal |publisher=Naacp.org |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>

In 2002, ''[[Christianity Today]]'' published an article called "The Church of O" in which they concluded that Winfrey had emerged as an influential spiritual leader. "Since 1994, when she abandoned traditional talk-show fare for more edifying content, and 1998, when she began 'Change Your Life TV', Oprah's most significant role has become that of spiritual leader.

Leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led invasion]] of Iraq, Winfrey's show received criticism for allegedly having an anti-war bias. [[Ben Shapiro]] of [[Townhall.com]] wrote: "Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in America. She decides what makes the ''New York Times'' best-seller lists. Her touchy-feely style sucks in audiences at the rate of 14 million viewers per day.

In 2007, Winfrey began to endorse the self-help program ''[[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]''. ''The Secret'' claims that people can change their lives through positive thoughts or 'vibrations', which will then cause them to attract more positive vibrations that result in good things happening to them. Peter Birkenhead of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' magazine argued that this idea is pseudoscience and psychologically damaging, as it trivializes important decisions and promotes a quick-fix material culture, and suggest Winfrey's promotion of it is irresponsible given her influence.<ref>Birkenhead, Peter.[http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2007/03/05/the_secret/ Oprah's ugly secret], ''Salon Life'', March 5, 2007.

Winfrey was named as the 2008 Person of the Year by animal-rights group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) for using her fame and listening audience to help the less fortunate, including animals.

Outside the U.S., Winfrey has become increasingly popular in the [[Arab world]].

{{Main|Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls}}
In 2004, Winfrey and her team filmed an episode of her show, ''Oprah's Christmas Kindness '', in which Winfrey travelled to South Africa to bring attention to the plight of young children affected by poverty and AIDS. During the 21-day trip, Winfrey and her crew visited schools and orphanages in poverty-stricken areas, and distributed Christmas presents to 50,000 children,<ref Name="Christmas Kindness">{{cite web|title=Christmas Kindness|publisher=Harpo Productions|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/ChristmasKindness-Inspiration|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> with dolls for the girls and soccer balls for the boys, and school supplies. Throughout the show, Winfrey appealed to viewers to donate money to Oprah's Angel Network for poor and AIDS-affected children in Africa. From that show alone, viewers around the world donated over $7,000,000. Winfrey invested $40&nbsp;million and some of her time establishing the [[Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls]] in [[Henley on Klip]] south of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. The school set over 22 acres, opened in January 2007 with an enrollment of 150 pupils (increasing to 450) and features state-of-the-art classrooms, computer and science laboratories, a library, theatre and beauty salon. [[Nelson Mandela]] praised Winfrey for overcoming her own disadvantaged youth to become a benefactor for others.
