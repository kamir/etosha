'''''The State''''' is a half-hour sketch-[[comedy]] [[television]] show, originally broadcast in the USA on [[MTV]] between December 17, 1993, and July 1, 1995.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/the-state/show/524/summary.html?q=the%20state&tag=search_results;title;1 The State at TV.com]</ref> The show combined bizarre characters and scenarios to present sketches that won the favor of its target teenaged audience. The cast consisted of 11 twenty-something [[comedian]]s who created, acted, wrote, directed and edited the show.

Several memorable characters were created for the show, and for a short time their [[catchphrase]]s entered into the vernacular. Often, the cast would appear as themselves and address the audience to promote fake contests or to deliver mock public service announcements. Much like [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]], ''The State'''s sketches were sometimes linked to each other in some way: a punchline or image that ended one sketch often provided a lead-in to the next.

After years of legal issues related to the [[soundtrack]] to many of the episodes, the series was released on [[DVD]] on July 14, 2009. A ''State'' film featuring all of the original troupe members is in the works, but was delayed by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007–2008 screenwriters strike]], and no release date for the project has been announced.<ref>[http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4107&Itemid=99 IESB Interview with David Wain].</ref>

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
''The State'' was founded as "The New Group" by Todd Holoubek at [[NYU]] in the late 1980s when he grew dissatisfied with the structure of other local comedy groups. Holoubek attracted film and acting talent by advertising this group as one where every member had "their own window". It was a free form idea wherein the group lacked central leadership and encouraged to act as a collective. Applicants came largely from the drama and film departments on campus. As they honed their talents, members were added and dropped until they eventually ended up with the cast that is familiar today. The State began performing locally and on campus where they garnered their reputation, followed by an off-broadway run of "Molt", produced by Jonathan K. Bendis and [[Steven Starr]]. MTV offered the group a collaboration with [[Jon Stewart]] on a show called ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'', which was followed by a six-episode commitment to ''The State'' show.

After three seasons with MTV, The State began talks with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to air opposite ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but the deal was eventually dropped. [[CBS]] then offered a series of specials with the promise that, should they be successful, the show would be picked up as a regular series. CBS initially wanted to develop the show in hopes that they would target a late-night younger audience, but controversy arose when ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine reported that ''The State''{{'}}s network executive allegedly made [[racism|racist]] remarks about the late-night [[African American]] television audience; the executive was subsequently fired.

The show was a ratings disaster due to an unsupportive network and lack of advertising. The CBS special marked the final new episode of ''The State'' to be aired.

Members of ''The State'' remained close and went on to contribute to other projects including ''[[Viva Variety]]'', ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Stella (US TV series)|Stella]]'', the films ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' and ''[[The Ten]]'' and the podcast ''[[RISK!]]'' About half the members went on to direct films and the entire cast remains active in the entertainment industry.

The entire cast regrouped for the first time in 14 years for two performances at [[SF Sketchfest]], The San Francisco Comedy Festival, on January 24, 2009, followed with a Q&A at The Clay Theater where they screened ''Wet Hot American Summer''. The following day they had a retrospective at Herbst Theater in San Francisco where they answered fans' questions and discussed the history of The State.

Nine members of the group (minus Allison and Holoubek) reunited on the January 28, 2014 broadcast of the [[Comedy Central]] game show ''[[@midnight]]'', which is produced by Lennon and Garant. Showalter, Kenny-Silver, and Black were contestants.

==About the show==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
''The State'' is not only the name of the television program, but also of the comedy troupe that made up the cast of the show, as they have continued to successfully work together on film, television and in the world of journalism in various groupings. A book, ''State by State With the State'' was published in April, 1997 but is currently out of print. An album titled ''[[Comedy for Gracious Living]]'' was recorded for [[Warner Bros.]] but was shelved for unknown reasons. After being unearthed from the Warner vault, it was finally released in September 2010 by Rhino/Handmade via rhino.com. With liner notes written by the troupe, the packaging is notable for having, perhaps, the longest printed booklet ever included in a CD package.

The show's style of humor revolved mainly around the cast members' character acting and high energy, and featured a broad range of comedic styles from [[satire]] to forays into absurdism, although the absurdist element was not played up as much until the third season.  Notable examples include "The Animal Song" and "The Howard Report".  In addition, a common theme of the show's humor was to introduce a sketch with a "straight man" character caught in a ridiculous premise, then turn the sketch around by making the premise turn out to be correct.  An example of this is the "Nazi War Criminals" sketch, in which a quiet suburban family is accosted by the [[FBI]] on suspicion of being [[Nazi]] [[war crimes|war criminals]] (despite seemingly being well under 30) due to information given by the family's nine-year-old son.  However, when the boy claims that "moon people" are about to invade earth, it is revealed that everything he has said is in fact true, and the family drops their ruse in light of the impending danger.

Despite being limited by having only one female member, [[Kerri Kenney]]'s energy and acting range (portraying anyone from an average housewife to [[Nancy Spungen]]) led the cast to describe her as "the only girl we need".  In sketches that called for more than one female role, Kenney would usually portray the character that needed to appear the most "feminine", and the other roles would go to male cast members who would wear drag.  In a number of sketches with a female character, Kenney does not appear.  During the "James Dixon: Power Priest" sketch, James weds a young couple in which the bride is played by [[Michael Ian Black]], and on the DVD commentary for this sketch, the cast jokes that "this is another instance of 'why didn't Kerri play the girl?'".  In one unaired sketch, "Drag Dad", Kenney actually played a male character, but it was done purposefully as part of the running joke of the sketch.

"Contrary to popular belief", says the troupe's official [[FAQ]], "the show was never canceled."<ref name="The State's official FAQ">[http://www.the-state.com/faq.htm#5 The State's official FAQ]</ref> For a variety of reasons, including network television politics, ''The State'' decided to pursue other interests and "establish ourselves as an entity that exists apart from any particular employer or TV Network."<ref name="The State's official FAQ"/>  However, [[CBS]] optioned to buy the show after its second year on MTV in hopes of increasing viewership among younger demographics and potentially providing competition against [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.  CBS intended to test the waters with ''The State's 43rd Annual All-Star Halloween Special'', which aired in prime time in 1995.  The special received generally good reviews (including some from critics that gave them harsh ones earlier), but due to little promotion, it received low ratings. The show was not picked up for further broadcasts.  On the series' DVD commentary, cast members revealed that MTV had offered contract for a guaranteed 65 additional shows, but the cast turned it down to leave to CBS, against their agent's advice.

The entire cast was featured (or made a cameo) in 2007's [[David Wain]]-directed film, ''[[The Ten (film)|The Ten]]''. On March 15, 2008, most of the cast reunited for a special reunion sketch show at [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]].

=== ''The State'' DVD release ===
A [[DVD]] release was eagerly anticipated by fans of the show. However, MTV remained reluctant for many years to distribute the show until a complete DVD set was released on July 14, 2009.

One of the factors that delayed the release of the series was that the troupe used many popular songs as background music in the original broadcast versions of nearly every episode. ''The State'' was produced during a period when MTV had deals with various record labels, via which the network could easily use many songs that had a video aired on the network in their original programming without having to pay royalties to the labels; ''The State'' used popular music as the background music for countless sketches, utilizing hits like [[The Byrds]]' "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", [[The Breeders]]' "[[Cannonball (The Breeders song)|Cannonball]]", [[Liz Phair]]'s "Supernova" and [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[Sexual Healing]]".<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/4795/songs.html&date=2009-10-25+11:07:01 List of songs used in The State]</ref> Due to the large [[royalty fee]]s each company would likely demand, the soundtrack as originally aired would have cost many times the amount that video sales would recoup, so ''The State'' was forced to re-record much of the backing music with different, sometimes [[sound-alike]], songs.

The first season of ''The State'', digitally re-mastered along with a new musical score, was made available on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[iTunes Store]] on September 26, 2006. Several episodes were also made available on [[Amazon Unbox]] as well as the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].

On March 10, 2007, David Wain announced at a screening of ''[[The Ten]]'' at [[SXSW]] that a DVD of ''The State'' was in production. At a later [[Philadelphia]] screening, he claimed it would be available in the fall of 2007. On May 18, 2007, during the 24-hour ''[[Human Giant]]'' marathon on MTV, [[Michael Showalter]] announced that a DVD set containing the entire series would be released by MTV sometime that year. He stated the set would contain every episode (some re-scored), commentaries, extras, and some sketches that never made it to the air.

The State's official website reported in November 2007 that the DVD set was completed, but that their distributor, MTV, has "chosen not to release the set at this time. We don't know why."<ref name="The State's official news page">[http://www.the-state.com/ The State's official news page].</ref>  On January 29, 2008, Showalter confirmed that MTV was still delaying the release: "They have it. We've made the DVD, and it exists. It's out of our hands, and I know who has it, but I don't know why they're waiting... we've done the commentary and the deleted material and all that stuff, but I just don't know when it's coming out. "<ref name=avshowalter/>

In 2009, some episodes of the series were made available in a free [[Streaming media|streaming]] format on the video website [[Joost]].<ref name="joost">[[Joost]].com page for ''The State'': "[http://www.joost.com/078u8gd/t/The-State-101#id=078u8gd Episode 1]".</ref> As of mid-April 2009, three episodes were added to the site.

In an April 2009 interview with scifiwire.com, [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] reported a DVD release date of July 14, 2009, a date which was also verified on thestate.mtv.com. To promote the release of the series on DVD, [[Comedy Central]], [[MTV]], and [[MTV2]] all aired select episodes of ''The State''.

===Reviews===
In January 1994, the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''{{Disambiguation needed|date=August 2014}} TV guide called the show "so terrible it deserves to be studied".<ref>{{cite journal | work=Daily News | title=The State Review | date=January 16, 1994}}</ref>  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the show "significantly less than sporadically funny" and gave it a C- rating.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302711,00.html | first=Ken | last=Tucker | title=The State | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=June 17, 1994 | accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref>
[[TV.com]] says many of ''The State'''s "sketches remain funny to this day and &mdash; unlike most shows of the age &mdash; would not be considered dated or stale... Even the few mediocre sketches on the show are better than 99% of today's sketch comedy."<ref name="TV.com review of The State">[http://www.tv.com/the-state/show/524/summary.html?q=the%20state&tag=search_results;title;1 TV.com review of The State].</ref>

===''The State'' film===
In 2008, the group was reported to be "reuniting for a movie about [[American history]]" for [[Comedy Central]], but the movie was delayed at the time "because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]]" of 2007-2008.<ref name=avshowalter>{{cite news| publisher=[[The Onion A.V. Club]]| url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/michael_showalter| title=Michael Showalter| author=Sean O'Neal| date=2008-01-29}}</ref> The working title is ''This American Sandwich''.

===''The State'' album===
Recorded at [[Compass Point Studios]] in 1996, "Comedy For Gracious Living," an album by ''The State'' cast members, was finally released by [[Rhino Records]] on September 20, 2010. The 25 track release features cuts such as "Skip This Track (They Were Drunk)" and "Kerri's one Second Noise."<ref>[http://www.rhino.com/product/comedy-for-gracious-living The State - Comedy For Gracious Living | rhino.com]</ref>

=== Theme song ===
The opening sequence was set to "Boys and Girls – Action" by [[Craig Wedren]] of [[Shudder To Think]] and [[Eli Janney (musician)|Eli Janney]] of [[Girls Against Boys]]. The song is built around samples of the [[Nation of Ulysses]] songs "The Kingdom of Heaven Must Be Taken By Storm" ("Boys and girls!") and "The Hickey Underworld" ("Action! Action!").

=== Recurring characters===
The cast (notably David Wain) have said that they were not interested in creating recurring characters, but were repeatedly pressured by the network to emulate ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in this manner.

{| class="wikitable"
| <center>Doug</center>
| Played by [[Michael Showalter]]. A high school student and wannabe rebel who pointlessly struggles against surprisingly permissive and understanding authority figures. Doug's catchphrase is a wan "I'm outta heeeerrre." A memorable sketch has Doug's father Don (Lennon) questioning him on his drug use. Doug replies "Drugs?! Hey man, I'm Doug, not [[Bob Dylan]]." His father asks him if he even knows who Bob Dylan is. Doug replies "No...but I know he died of drugs." Doug's father then tells him Bob Dylan is alive and well, and that he in fact produced his last three albums, to which Doug replies, "Oh, you mean Uncle Robert?" He would often be followed by a group of friends (usually played by [[Ken Marino]], [[Kerri Kenney-Silver|Kerry Kenney]], [[Michael Patrick Jann]], and [[Joe Lo Truglio]]), who would inevitably find the authority figure cooler than Doug and decide to hang with them instead. Doug's father, Don, is played by [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and appears in the "Doug" sketches in 102, 204 and 305.

Appearances: 102: "Doug & Dad", "Captain Monterey Jack: Lights", 103: "Captain Monterey Jack: Shoes", 106: "Doug & Principal", "Captain Monterey Jack: Cheese", 204: "Doug III", 302: "Kabuki Doug", 305: "Doug IV"
|-
| <center>Louie</center>
| Played by [[Ken Marino]]. One of the more ironic characters on the show, parodying sketch comedy characters who rely on catchphrases. Louie is a genial fellow with a strong desire to dip his "balls" (actual golf balls, although the innuendo was certainly intentional) in various things. His catchphrase, naturally, is a very enthusiastic "I wanna dip my balls in it!" One of the more memorable Louie sketches placed him at [[The Last Supper]], in which Louie and his catchphrase distract the [[Twelve Apostles]] from [[Jesus]]' speech concerning his fate. Louie would often tire of the gag halfway through the sketch, because he feels that it has "been done", but would be encouraged by the loving crowd to continue. The punch line was that Louie would tell them they knew what he was going to say, they would say they didn't but would then shout it along with him. According to DVD commentaries, "Louie" was originally a character who would only appear one time. MTV wanted a recurring character with a catchphrase, and the sketch was a "fuck you" to executives. According to a DVD commentary, "Louie" became a recurring character because "We liked it!"

Appearances: 102: "Louie", 103: "Louie II", 302: "Kabuki Doug", 303: "Louie & the Last Supper", 305: "Doug IV"
|-
| <center>Barry and Levon</center>
| Played by [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and [[Michael Ian Black]], respectively. Suave swingers of ambiguous [[sexual orientation]]. Their most notable moment was a sketch in which they had purchased and prepared $240 worth of pudding, which sat in a pile that they proceeded to sweet-talk and dance with. This is another sketch which fell victim to a compromised soundtrack when released on [[iTunes]]. It was originally accompanied with "[[Sexual Healing]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]]. It also appears that the music was played on camera, as, according to the DVD commentary, the dialogue between Barry and Levon has been overdubbed. According to a DVD commentary, "$240 Worth of Pudding" was written by Black and Lennon.

Appearances: 104: "$240 Worth of Pudding", 203: "Barry and Levon", 302: "Kabuki Doug", 303: "Deathfight 5000", 306: "Planet Groovy"
|-
| <center>Old-Fashioned Guy</center>
| Played by Thomas Lennon. A country gentleman who clings to antiquated, sometimes primitive beliefs, which seem absurd in modern society. "Call me old fashioned ... but I think we should worship the sun and moon as powerful gods, and fear them."

Appearances: 102: "Old Fashioned Guy 1", "Old Fashioned Guy 2", 106: "Old Fashioned Guy", 107: "Old Fashioned Guy"
|-
| <center>James Dixon</center>
| Played by Thomas Lennon. A conniving, hard-driving ex-[[Hollywood]] agent who lands himself very unlikely careers (high school guidance counselor, [[Catholic]] priest, [[Jedi]] talent agent) and applies his showbiz tactics to his new positions. "You can't bargain with God. But you can bargain with me, and I can bargain with God." According to DVD commentaries, the character was based on the group's agent, James Dixon.

Appearances: 107: "James Dixon: Guidance Counselor", 201: "James Dixon: Power Priest", 313: "Dixon: Jedi Talent Agency"
|-
| <center>Barry Toink</center>
| Played by [[Joe Lo Truglio]]. An extremely wordy high school jock. He is the focus of the season 2 sketch "Bookworm" in which he tries to find the word for "one who loves books"  so that he can make fun of a nerd in the cafeteria. He is one of the recurring characters, along with Doug, Louie, and Barry and Levon, featured in "Kabuki Doug."

Appearances: 103: "Antonio", 203: "Bookworm", 302: "Kabuki Doug"
|-
| <center>Captain Monterey Jack</center>
| Played by Michael Ian Black. A nonsense-spewing motivational speaker, a parody of similar anti-drug or alcohol abuse spots aired on MTV at the time). "And remember, bbbbring, bbbring... Hello, cheese? '''NO!''' Cheese can't dial a phone." Doug ''(see above)'' made his first appearances in the Capt. Monterey Jack sketches.

Appearances: 102: "Captain Monterey Jack: Lights", 103: "Captain Monterey Jack: Shoes", 106: "Captain Monterey Jack: Cheese"
|-
| <center>The Jew, the Italian, and the Redhead Gay</center>
| Played by [[David Wain]], [[Ken Marino]], and [[Kevin Allison]], respectively. Good-naturedly broad stereotypes, introduced after an announcement from The State that in the future, they would "try to avoid stereotyping of any kind".  The three are at first roommates, later crime-fighters in the style of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' who track down villains based on additional stereotypes (they succeed in catching an [[Irish people|Irish]] criminal after finding him at a bar). According to a DVD commentary, the original sketch was written by Marino, Allison, and Wain.

Appearances: 301: "The Jew, the Italian, and the Redhead Gay", 308: "Jew II, pt. 1", "Jew II, pt. 2"
|-
| <center>Inbred Brothers</center>
| Emmett played by Thomas Lennon. Lyle played by [[Ben Garant]]. Two very stupid inbred hillbilly brothers who spend a lot of time hitting themselves on the head. What would have been the first "Inbred Brothers" sketch was shot for season one but never aired. Catchphrase-( Emmett:) "What am I doin'?"

Appearances: 205: "Inbred Brothers", 311: "Inbred Brothers - Army"
|-
| <center>Monkeys Do It</center>
| Joey played by Joe Lo Truglio, Tony played by Ken Marino, Anthony played by Michael Showalter, Joseph played by Michael Ian Black, Tony's mother played by Thomas Lennon, Gina played by [[Kerri Kenney]], Sherry played by [[Todd Holoubek]]. Tony, Anthony, Joseph and Joey are four [[Italian-American]] teenage friends who hang out in Tony's basement. In the first sketch, they are bored on their summer vacation.  Joseph suggests they go to the zoo to watch the monkeys "do it." They go on to get in some digs at Anthony's sister (a "beautiful girl with a very hairy face") and debate over whether or not [[penguins]] are "natural" (Anthony claims they were chemically man-made "like [[The Incredible Hulk]]" and that the [[Bible]] never mentions penguins). Tony's sister Gina and her best friend Sherry come downstairs, demanding that the boys take them along or else Gina will tell their mother about Tony's "perversion." Gina and Tony bicker, then everyone else starts shouting, until Gina and Tony's mother comes down to see what the ruckus is.  After Gina tells Ma that the boys were planning to go to the zoo to watch the monkeys "do it," Ma insists they all have "dirty minds" and that the monkeys don't "do it" - rather, they "make love." She then describes how the monkeys would do such a thing, then asks Tony to grab her video camera and Joey to get her car so they can go to the zoo and "watch the monkeys make amore." The characters were reprised later that season in a Thanksgiving-themed sketch, with several additional characters. According to the DVD commentary, the original sketch was written by Marino, Black, and possibly a forgotten co-writer/co-writers (possibly either Lo Truglio or Showalter)

Appearances: 301: "Monkeys Do It", 307: "Monkeys Do It II"
