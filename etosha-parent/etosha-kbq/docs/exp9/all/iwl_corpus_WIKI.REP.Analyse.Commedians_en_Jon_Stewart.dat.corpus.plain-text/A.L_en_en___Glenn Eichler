'''Glenn Eichler''' is a comedy writer who started out as an editor for the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine.  From there, he moved over to work as story editor for the [[MTV]] television shows, ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and ''[[The Maxx]]''. He was later responsible for creating and producing the television show ''[[Daria]]'', a spinoff from ''Beavis and Butt-head'', for MTV<ref name="rs10"/>  as well as ''[[Hey Joel]]'' for [[VH1]].  He has also written for such shows as ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', and ''[[The Wrong Coast]]'', a stop-action animation mini-series for the [[American Movie Classics]] cable channel. He currently writes for [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.

Glenn is the author of the humor books ''[[Mush!: Sled Dogs with Issues]]'', ''[[Stuffed!]]'', ''[[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]]'s Twelve-Step Guide to Recovery'' (a political satire), and ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist|Dr. Katz]]'s Me At a Glance''.

Because he was producer of ''Daria'', he is sometimes claimed to be the creator of the character [[Daria Morgendorffer]]; this was actually the work of ''Beavis and Butt-head'' writer David Felton, with some input from [[Mike Judge]].<ref>"Taint of Greatness Part 1" documentary in ''Beavis and Butt-head: The Mike Judge Collection''</ref>
