'''Mervyn Edward "Merv" Griffin, Jr.''' (July 6, 1925 – August 12, 2007) was a U.S. television host, musician, actor, and [[media mogul]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/12/griffin.obit.ap/index.html |title= Spokeswoman: 'Jeopardy' inventor Merv Griffin dies at 82 |accessdate=August 12, 2007 |date=August 12, 2007 |publisher=CNN |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070917082035/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/12/griffin.obit.ap/index.html |archivedate = September 17, 2007}}</ref> He began his career as a radio and big band singer who went on to appear in film and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. From 1965 to 1986 Griffin hosted his own talk show, ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', produced by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] (also known as Group W). He also created the game shows ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Click (game show)|Click]]'', ''[[Ruckus (game show)|Ruckus]]'', and ''[[Merv Griffin's Crosswords]]'' with his own television production companies, [[Merv Griffin Enterprises]] and [[Merv Griffin Entertainment]]. During his lifetime, Griffin was considered an entertainment [[business magnate]].

==Early life==
Griffin was born into a U.S. Irish family on July 6, 1925, in [[San Mateo, California]] to Mervyn Edward Griffin, Sr., a stock-broker, and Rita Elizabeth Griffin (née Robinson),<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=tt8jAQAAIAAJ&q=Rita+Elizabeth+Robinson+griffin&dq=Rita+Elizabeth+Robinson+griffin&hl=en&redir_esc=y |title=Who's who in California – Alice Catt Armstrong |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref> a homemaker. Raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], Griffin started singing in his church choir as a boy, and by his teens was earning extra money as a church organist. His abilities as a pianist played a part in his early entry into show business.

He attended [[San Mateo High School]], graduating in 1942, and continued to aid in financing the school. He attended [[San Mateo Junior College]] and then the [[University of San Francisco]].<ref name="NYTOBITUARY"/> He was a member of the international fraternity [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]].<ref name=nndb>{{cite web | title=Merv Griffin | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/418/000022352 | work=The Notable Names Database | publisher=Soylent Communications | accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Griffin was declared [[4F (military conscription)|4F]] after failing several military physical examinations due to having a slight [[heart]] [[Heart murmur|murmur]].<ref name="beyondthegray.wordpress.com">"[http://beyondthegray.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/merv-griffin-before-he-was-a-legend Merv Griffin, Before He Was a Legend]" August 12, 2009.</ref> Drafted for service during the [[Korean War]], he was then deemed fit for service, but was considered too old as the drafting age limit was twenty-six years and he had just turned twenty-seven.

==Career==

===Singing===
Griffin started as a singer on radio at nineteen years old, appearing on ''San Francisco Sketchbook'', a nationally [[radio syndication|syndicated]] program based at [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]]. Griffin was overweight as an adolescent, which disappointed his radio fans.<ref name="beyondthegray.wordpress.com"/> Embarrassed by their reaction, Griffin resolved to lose weight and change his image, losing 80 pounds in four months. [[Freddy Martin]] heard him on the radio show and asked Griffin to tour with his [[big band|orchestra]],<ref name="lowry">{{cite news | author=Cynthia Lowry| title=Merv Griffin: Question and Answer Man | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=[[Pasadena Star-News|Independent Star-News]] | date=March 29, 1964}}</ref> which he did for four years.<ref>{{cite web | author=All Movie Guide | title=Merv Griffin Filmography | url=http://www.fandango.com/mervgriffin/filmography/p+28806 | publisher=Fandango | accessdate=August 12, 2007}}</ref>

Griffin also had an uncredited role as a radio announcer in the 1953 horror/science fiction classic ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]''.

By 1945, Griffin had earned enough money to form his own record label, Panda Records, which produced ''Songs by Merv Griffin'', the first U.S. album ever recorded on magnetic tape.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049926/entertainment-legend-merv-griffin-dies-at-82 Entertainment Legend Merv Griffin Dies At 82], from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''</ref> In 1947, he had a 15-minute Monday-Friday singing program on KHJ in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite news|title=Your Cue: Merv Griffin|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Life/40s/47/Radio-Life-1947-06-08.pdf|accessdate=December 3, 2014|agency=Radio Life|date=June 8, 1947}}</ref>

He became increasingly popular with night-club audiences, and his fame soared among the general public with his 1950 hit "[[I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts]]". The song reached the number one spot on the [[Hit Parade]] and sold three million copies.<ref>{{cite web | title=TV Land Remembers Merv Griffin | url=http://www.tvland.com/obits/mervgriffin | publisher=TV Land | date= | accessdate=September 9, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926210951/http://www.tvland.com/obits/mervgriffin/ |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>

At one of his night-club performances, Griffin was discovered by [[Doris Day]]. Day arranged for a [[screen test]] at the [[Warner Bros.]] Studios for a role in ''[[By the Light of the Silvery Moon (film)|''By the Light of the Silvery Moon]]''. Griffin did not get the part, but the screen test led to supporting roles in other musical films such as ''[[So This Is Love (film)|So This Is Love]]'' in 1953.<ref>{{cite news | author=Richard Natale | title=Hollywood legend Merv Griffin dies |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970093.html?categoryid=2492&cs=1 | work=Variety | date=August 12, 2007 | accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref> The film caused a minor controversy when Griffin shared an open-mouthed [[kiss]] with [[Kathryn Grayson]]. The kiss was a first in Hollywood film history since the introduction of the [[Production Code]] in 1934.<ref>{{cite news | author=Erik Pedersen | title='Visionary' H'wood host, tycoon Merv Griffin dies | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i11da93653366e6b325a6577b8af9fe8f | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=August 13, 2007 | accessdate=September 9, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930232138/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i11da93653366e6b325a6577b8af9fe8f |archivedate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Griffin would go on to film more pictures (''[[The Boy from Oklahoma]]'' and ''[[Phantom of the Rue Morgue]]''), but soon became disillusioned with movie-making. Griffin bought his contract back from Warner Bros. and decided to devote his attention to a new medium: television.<ref name=nndb />

In March 2001, Griffin returned to singing with the release of the album ''It's Like a Dream''.

===Game show host===
From 1958 to 1962, Griffin hosted a game show produced by [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] called ''[[Play Your Hunch]]''. The show appeared on all three networks, but primarily on [[NBC]]. He also hosted a prime time game show for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] called ''Keep Talking''. Additionally, he also substituted for a week for the vacationing [[Bill Cullen]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', and also for [[Bud Collyer]] on ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''. In 1963, NBC offered him the opportunity to host a new game show, ''Word for Word'', which Griffin produced. He also produced ''Let's Play Post Office'' for NBC in 1965; ''Reach for the Stars'' for NBC in 1967; and ''One in a Million'' for ABC in 1967.

===Talk show host===
Griffin scored a coup when [[Jack Paar]] accidentally emerged onto the set of ''Play Your Hunch'' during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him to stay for a spontaneous interview. The interview led to a guest-hosting spot on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', then hosted by Paar.

While [[Johnny Carson]] finished his ABC contract (he was hosting the afternoon game show ''Who Do You Trust'') before taking over ''Tonight'' after Paar in October 1962, Griffin was one of the many guest hosts NBC used. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts,<ref name="pioneersoftv">"Late Night". ''Pioneers of Television'', January 9, 2008.</ref> and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful however, and was cancelled in 1963.

In 1965, Griffin launched a syndicated talk show for Group W ([[Westinghouse Broadcasting]]): ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''. The show aired in a variety of time slots throughout North America; many stations ran it in the daytime, others aired it in prime-time and a few broadcast it opposite [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Griffin's announcer/sidekick was the veteran British character actor [[Arthur Treacher]], who had been his mentor. After Treacher left the show in 1970, Griffin would do the announcing himself, and walk on stage with the phrase: "And now..., here I come!" According to an obituary article on August 24, 2007 in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''The Merv Griffin Show'' was on the air for 21 years and won eleven [[Emmy Award]]s during its run.

Griffin was not shy about tackling controversial subjects, especially the [[Vietnam War]]. The guests on the Westinghouse show were an eclectic mix of entertainers, authors, politicians, and "personality" performers like [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. Griffin also booked controversial guests like [[George Carlin]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Norman Mailer]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Griffin received critical acclaim for booking such guests, but was also widely criticized for it. When philosopher and [[anti-war]] activist Bertrand Russell used Griffin's show to condemn the war in [[Vietnam]], Griffin was criticized for letting Russell have his say. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], later the [[List of Governors of California|38th Governor of California]], made his talk show debut in the United States on Griffin's talk show in 1974 after moving from [[Austria]].

Griffin dedicated two shows to the topic of [[Transcendental Meditation]] and its founder [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], one in 1975, the other in 1977. Griffin himself was an enthusiastic student of the [[Transcendental Meditation technique|practice]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-maharishi6feb06,1,4208394.story | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; founded Transcendental Meditation movement | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | first=Elaine | last=Woo}}</ref>

[[File:Arthur Treacher Merv Griffin Merv Griffin late night show 1969.JPG|thumb|180px|Griffin (right) and sidekick [[Arthur Treacher]] in 1969.]]
Griffin would also frequently chat with audience members.<ref name=nndb /> One regular audience member, [[Lillian Miller]], would become a fixture on Griffin's program throughout its run.

Griffin's best friend since the sixth grade, Robert (Bob) Murphy, was the producer of ''The Merv Griffin Show,'' and eventually became president of Merv Griffin Enterprises.

===Late-night host===
CBS gave Griffin a late-night show opposite Carson in 1969, a move which proved disastrous. The network was uncomfortable with the guests Griffin wanted, who often spoke out against the Vietnam War and on other taboo topics. When political activist [[Abbie Hoffman]] was Griffin's guest in April 1970, CBS blurred the video of Hoffman so viewers at home would not see his trademark American flag pattern shirt even though other guests had worn the same shirt in the past, uncensored. Griffin disliked the censorship imposed by CBS and complained.<ref name=nndb />

Sensing that his time at CBS was ending, and tired of the restrictions imposed by the network, Griffin secretly signed a contract with rival company [[Metromedia]]. The contract with Metromedia would give him a syndicated daytime talk show deal as soon as CBS canceled Griffin's show. Within a few months, Griffin was fired by CBS. His new show began the following Monday and ran until the mid-1980s. By 1986, Griffin was ready to retire and ended his talk show run. Due to profits from his highly successful game shows, Griffin had become one of the world's wealthiest entertainers.<ref name=nndb />

==Game show creator==
Griffin created and produced the successful television game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' in 1964; in an [[Associated Press]] profile released right before the show premiered, Griffin talked about the show's origins:<ref name="lowry"/>
:My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York from Duluth. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question.
:She fired a couple of answers to me: '5,280' and the question of course was how many feet in a mile. Another was '79 Wistful Vista.' That was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address. I loved the idea, went straight to NBC with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.

The show, originally titled ''What's the Question?'', premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964, hosted by [[Art Fleming]], and lasted for 11 years. Griffin wrote the 30-second piece of music heard during the show's Final Jeopardy! Round, and which later became the iconic melody of the theme for the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version of the show hosted by [[Alex Trebek]].

In 1975, NBC canceled ''Jeopardy!'' after moving it twice on its daytime schedule, despite having an additional year on its network contract left to fulfill. Griffin produced the show's successor, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', which premiered on January 6, 1975. ''Wheel'', with [[Chuck Woolery]] as host and [[Susan Stafford]] as the hostess, had successful ratings throughout its network run. From December 1975 to January 1976, the show expanded to an hour, in response to the successful 60-minute version of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' on CBS.

"Wheel" barely escaped cancellation in 1980, when NBC replaced three of its other game shows with a daytime talk show starring [[David Letterman]]; NBC finally cancelled it in 1989, when CBS picked it up for a year (only to return to NBC, when the daytime version was finally cancelled for good in 1991). The show became a phenomenon, when on September 19, 1983, a nighttime version hit the syndication market with [[Pat Sajak]] and [[Vanna White]] as host and hostess, respectively.

As for ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', two different revivals of the show would be produced: one on [[NBC]] that ran for five months in late 1978/early 1979 with [[Art Fleming]] returning as host, and the other airing in first-run syndication beginning on September 10, 1984, starring [[Alex Trebek]]. The syndicated versions of both ''Jeopardy!'' and ''Wheel'' remain on the air today.

In 1990, Griffin had an ambitious but unsuccessful attempt at adapting the venerable [[board game]] ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' into a [[Monopoly (game show)|game show of the same name]]. His last game show was a wild game show called ''[[Ruckus (game show)|Ruckus]],'' which emanated from the [[Resorts International Hotel & Casino]] in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old ''[[Reach for the Stars (game show)|Reach for the Stars]],'' the show initially aired locally in New York, with the intent of national syndication early the following year. [[The Amazing Johnathan]] left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get a look at it, via reruns that aired for a time on [[Game Show Network|GSN]].

Upon his retirement, Griffin sold his production company, [[Merv Griffin Enterprises]], to [[Columbia Pictures Television]], at the time a unit of [[The Coca-Cola Company]], for [[United States Dollar|US$]]250 million on May 6, 1986, the largest acquisition of an entertainment company owned by a single individual at that time. Following the sale, ''[[Forbes]]'' named him the richest Hollywood performer in history. He retained the title of creator of both his game shows.

The two powerhouses spun off numerous programs, and Griffin often would sign on as a creative consultant. The spin-offs included ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' on CBS in 1997 and the short lived ''[[Jep!]]'' on GSN in 1998, both for children; ''[[Rock & Roll Jeopardy!]]'' on [[VH1]] in 1998 for purveyors of pop music trivia; a teen-oriented game called ''[[Click (game show)|Click!]]'', which introduced [[Ryan Seacrest]] as its host, and – in association with [[Wink Martindale]] – ''[[Headline Chasers]]'' in 1985.

On May 14, 2003, Griffin was honored with the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] (BMI) President's Award at its annual Film and Television Awards ceremony, for having created some of America's best-known game show melodies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233747 |title=For Merv Griffin, 14 Seconds Can Last a Lifetime|publisher=Broadcast Music, Inc.|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, Griffin's production company, [[Merv Griffin Entertainment]], began production on a new syndicated game show ''[[Merv Griffin's Crosswords]]'' (originally titled ''Let's Play Crosswords'' and ''Let's Do Crosswords''). The show taped in Los Angeles after initial reports that it would be produced at [[WMAQ-TV]] in Chicago. The show was produced in association with Program Partners and the [[William Morris Agency]] and began airing September 10, 2007. [[NBC]]-owned-and-operated stations in [[WNBC|New York]], [[KNBC|Los Angeles]], [[WMAQ-TV|Chicago]], [[KNTV|San Francisco]] and [[KXAS-TV|Dallas]] carried the show, with many stations airing two episodes per day. The show lasted only one season, ending on May 16, 2008 in first-run and September 5, 2008 in reruns.

==Business ventures==
[[File:Merv Griffin Way with The Beverly Hilton in the background.JPG|thumb|Merv Griffin Way with The Beverly Hilton in the background.]]
Griffin ventured into real estate, purchasing the [[Beverly Hilton Hotel]] in Beverly Hills. He also purchased Resorts Hotel and Casino, formerly [[Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel]] in [[Atlantic City]] from [[Donald Trump]] in 1988. An active desert resident, he was a supporter of the La Quinta Arts Festival and the owner of the Merv Griffin Givenchy Resort & Spa in Palm Springs, now The Parker. He owned a ranch near [[La Quinta, California]] where he raised [[thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]]s, as well as St. Clerans Manor, a boutique hotel, set in an eighteenth-century estate once owned by director [[John Huston]], near Craughwell, in County [[Galway]], Ireland. In the 1980s, Griffin purchased the [[Paradise Island]] Resort and Casino in the [[Bahamas]] for US$400 million from Trump, but he later sold it for just US$125 million. Griffin sold his empire to [[The Coca-Cola Company]] for $250 million in 1986, then went on a buying spree of hotels, so that his wealth in 2003 was said to be around $1.2 billion.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432607/dear_mister_fantasy/ | title=Dear Mister Fantasy | author=John Colapinto | work=Rolling Stone | accessdate=July 19, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Gaming Hall of Fame Award | url=http://www.fineawards.com/custom-gaming-hall.htm | publisher=Fine Awards | date= | accessdate=September 9, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928051537/http://www.fineawards.com/custom-gaming-hall.htm |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Griffin kept many details of his personal and business life private, including his alleged bisexuality, and other claims{{clarify|date=December 2014}} that he died a closeted homosexual. In 1991, he was sued by [[Deney Terrio]], the host of ''[[Dance Fever]]'', another show Mr. Griffin created, alleging sexual harassment. The same year, Brent Plott, a longtime employee who worked as a bodyguard, horse trainer and driver, filed a $200 million palimony lawsuit. Griffin characterized both lawsuits as extortion; ultimately, both suits were dismissed. He consistently evaded answering questions about his sexuality with a characteristic quip. In a 2005 interview with The New York Times, Griffin said: “I tell everybody that I’m a quarter-sexual. I will do anything with anybody for a quarter.”

He remained friends with his ex-wife, whom he credited with creating the premise of ''Jeopardy!''. On being wealthy he said that "if people know you're rich they don't talk with you when you walk down the street." He kept his wealth as an open secret, amassing media outlets, hotels and casinos with a net worth widely estimated at more than a billion dollars. Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it "would keep me from sleeping at night".<ref name="NYTOBITUARY">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/13/arts/television/13griffin.html | work=The New York Times | title=Merv Griffin, Television Innovator, Dies at 82 | first1=Richard | last1=Severo | first2=Edward | last2=Wyatt | date=August 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> He and former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] exchanged birthday greetings each July 6, for they shared the same birthday.

He was friends with both of the Reagans for many years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Gerhart |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/06/11/AR2005033113573.html |title=A Widow's Heartfelt Farewell |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 11, 2004 |accessdate=November 20, 2007}}</ref>

===Honors===
In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated|publisher=Palmspringswalkofstars.com|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>

In 2005, he accepted the degree Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) from the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].

In 2008, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]].

==Illness and death==
[[File:Merv Griffin grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Griffin's grave, located at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]].]]

Griffin's [[prostate cancer]], treated originally in 1996, returned and he was admitted to [[Cedars Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, where his condition deteriorated, leading to his death on August 12, 2007, at the age of 82.<ref>{{cite web | title=Merv Griffin in grave condition | url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/0809merv0809.html | work=[[The Desert Sun]] | publisher=azcentral.com | date=August 9, 2007 | accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Merv Griffin dies at age 82 | author=David Zurawik | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-griffinobit0812,0,2231857.story | date=August 12, 2007 | work=Baltimore Sun | accessdate=August 12, 2007}}</ref> Griffin is survived by his son, Tony, born in 1959 during Griffin's marriage to Julann Wright from 1958 to 1976, as well as two grandchildren.<ref name="STimes">{{cite news | author=Kakie Urch; Bruce Fessier; Erica Solvig | title=Remembering Merv Griffin, 1925–2007 | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2003833182_webgriffin12.html | newspaper=The Desert Sun | date=August 12, 2007 | accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref>

Funeral services were held for Griffin on August 17, 2007, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in [[Beverly Hills]]. The well-attended service included Nancy Reagan; Arnold Schwarzenegger (who gave the eulogy along with Tony Griffin); [[Maria Shriver]]; and various actors, television stars, employees, and friends including Sajak, White, Trebek, [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Jack Klugman]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and partner [[Portia de Rossi]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], and [[Catherine Oxenberg]] and husband [[Casper Van Dien]]. Pallbearers included Griffin Group vice-chairman Ron Ward, President Robert Pritchard, and Vice President Michael Eyre, as well as Tony Griffin. His 7-year-old grandson Donovan Mervyn was an honorary pallbearer as was Nancy Reagan. His 12-year-old granddaughter Farah gave a reading. A post-burial reception was held at the [[Hilton Hotels|Beverly Hilton]], a property owned by Griffin from 1987 to 2003.<ref>{{cite news | title=Hundreds Pay Final Respects To Merv Griffin | url=http://www.knbc.com/entertainment/13917581/detail.html?dl=mainclick | publisher=KNBC Los Angeles | date=August 17, 2007 | accessdate=September 9, 2007}}</ref> He was buried in [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] and his headstone epitaph (even though in his book ''Merv'', written with David Bender in 2003, states it would be "Stay Tuned") reads "I will <u>not</u> be right back after this message", an epitaph Griffin announced on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''.

[[Game Show Network|GSN]] honored Griffin by airing ten-episode marathons of ''Wheel'' and ''Jeopardy!'' during the weekend of August 18–19, 2007. The ''Wheel'' marathon included two episodes with cameo appearances by Griffin: Sajak's departure from the daytime version in 1989 and a 1992–93 episode that ended with Griffin, his band "The MervTones," and White singing at a dinner club in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The ''Jeopardy!'' marathon consisted of a rerun of the [[Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters]] Tournament from 2002.
His estate was recently sold for $7 million with the money being raised by San Diego–based GNT Financial.  GNT is owned by Marcus Carter.
