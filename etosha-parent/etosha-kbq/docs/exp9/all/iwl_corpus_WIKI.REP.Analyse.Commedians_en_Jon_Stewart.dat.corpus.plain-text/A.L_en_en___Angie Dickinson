'''Angie Dickinson''' (born September 30, 1931) is an American actress who has appeared in more than 50 films and starred on television as Sergeant Leann "Pepper" Anderson in the successful 1970s crime series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''.

==Early life==
Dickinson, the second of four daughters, was born '''Angeline Brown''' (called "Angie" by family and friends) in [[Kulm, North Dakota|Kulm]], [[North Dakota]], the daughter of Fredericka (née Hehr) and Leo Henry Brown.<ref>[http://brak.archive.org/stream/hankinsonnewsmar19281931coll/hankinsonnewsmar19281931coll_djvu.txt]</ref> Her family is of [[German American|German]] descent and she was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09194/983517-129.stm|title=Patricia Sheridan's Breakfast With ...

The previous year, she had won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights essay contest. She studied at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] and in 1954 graduated from [[Immaculate Heart College]] with a degree in [[business]]. Taking a cue from her publisher father, she had intended to be a writer. While a student from 1950–52, she worked as a secretary at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] Air Terminal in Burbank (now [[Bob Hope Airport]]) and in a parts factory. She became '''Angie Dickinson''' in 1952, when she married football player Gene Dickinson.

==Career==

===Early career===
Dickinson entered a [[beauty pageant]] in 1953 and placed second. The exposure brought her to the attention of a television industry producer, who asked her to consider a career in acting. She studied the craft and a few years later was approached by [[NBC]] to guest-star on a number of variety shows, including ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]''. She soon met [[Frank Sinatra]], who became a lifelong friend. She later was cast as Sinatra's wife in the film ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]''.

On [[New Year's Eve]] 1954, Dickinson made her television acting debut in an episode of ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. This led to other roles in such productions as ''[[Matinee Theatre]]'' (eight episodes), ''[[Buffalo Bill Jr.]]'', ''[[City Detective (TV series)|City Detective]]'', ''[[It's a Great Life]]'' (two episodes), ''[[Gray Ghost (TV series)|Gray Ghost]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'', ''[[The People's Choice (TV series)|The People's Choice]]'' (twice), ''[[Meet McGraw]]'' (twice), ''[[Northwest Passage (TV series)|Northwest Passage]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', and ''[[The Restless Gun]]''.

In 1956, Dickinson was cast as Ann Drew, who slips a gun to her jailed husband, Harry (John Craven), a former associate of the [[Jesse James]] gang, in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Desilu]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', starring [[Hugh O'Brian]]. In the story line, Harry vowed never to go to prison and was shot to death while escaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631835/|title=One of Jesse's Gang, March 13, 1956|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Angie-dickinson.jpg|thumb|left|Angie Dickinson wore [[yellowface]] to play a [[Eurasian]] character in ''China Gate'' (1957)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=Gwendolyn Audrey|title=Performing Whiteness: Postmodern Re/Constructions in the Cinema|date=2012|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-5627-7|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTpViCNxlhwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref>]]
In 1957, she was cast as Amy Bender in [[Richard Boone]]'s series "[[Have Gun-Will Travel]]" episode,'A Matter of Ethics'. She was cast as the sister of a man who was killed and who wanted the murderer lynched. Paladin was hired by the accused to make sure they didn't achieve their goal.

In 1958, she was cast as Laura Meadows in the episode "The Deserters" of the ABC/[[Warner Brothers]] western series, ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'', with [[Wayde Preston]]. The guest cast also included [[Michael Dante]] as Ab Saunders and [[Myron Healey]] as an unnamed fur trader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=Colt .45|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}</ref> That year she also played the role of defendant Mrs. Fargo in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode: "The Case of the One-Eyed Witness".

Dickinson went on to create memorable characters in ''[[Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer|Mike Hammer]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', and ''[[Men into Space]]''. In 1965, she had a recurring role as Carol Tredman on NBC's ''[[Dr. Kildare]]''. She had a memorable turn as the duplicitous murder conspirator in a 1964 episode of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' series with [[David Janssen]] and fellow guest star [[Robert Duvall]]. She was at her evil best as an unfaithful wife and bank robber in the 1958 "Wild Blue Yonder" episode of Rod Cameron's underrated syndicated television series ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]''. She starred in two ''[[List of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes|Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' episodes, "Captive Audience" with [[James Mason]] on Oct. 18, 1962, and "Thanatos Palace Hotel" on Feb. 1, 1965.

Dickinson's motion picture career began with a small, uncredited role in ''[[Lucky Me (film)|Lucky Me]]'' (1954) starring [[Doris Day]], followed by ''The Return of Jack Slade'' (1955), ''[[Man with the Gun]]'' (1955), and ''Hidden Guns'' (1956). She had her first starring role in ''[[Gun the Man Down]]'' (1956) with [[James Arness]], followed by the [[Sam Fuller]] cult film ''[[China Gate (1957 film)|China Gate]]'' (1957), which depicted an early view of the [[Vietnam War]].

Rejecting the [[Marilyn Monroe]]/[[Jayne Mansfield]] style of platinum blonde sex-symbolism because she felt it would narrow her acting options, Dickinson initially allowed studios to lighten her naturally-brunette hair to only honey-blonde. She appeared early in her career mainly in B-movies or [[western (genre)|western]]s, including ''[[Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend]]'' (1957) in which she co-starred with [[James Garner]]. In the 1958 crime drama ''[[Cry Terror!]]'', Dickinson had a supporting role opposite [[James Mason]] and [[Rod Steiger]] as a [[femme fatale]].

===Leading lady===
[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (27).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dickinson with [[John Wayne]] in ''Rio Bravo'']]
In 1959, Dickinson's big-screen breakthrough role came in [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[Rio Bravo (1959 film)|Rio Bravo]]'', in which she played a flirtatious gambler called "Feathers" who becomes attracted to the town sheriff played by Dickinson's childhood idol [[John Wayne]]. The film co-starred [[Dean Martin]], [[Ricky Nelson]], and [[Walter Brennan]]. When Hawks sold his personal contract with her to a major studio without her knowledge, she was unhappy. Dickinson nonetheless became one of the more prominent leading ladies of the next decade, beginning with ''[[The Bramble Bush]]'' with [[Richard Burton]] and ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'' with friends Sinatra and Martin, two films released in 1960. These were followed by the political [[potboiler]] ''[[A Fever in the Blood]]'' (1961), a Belgian Congo-based melodrama, ''[[The Sins of Rachel Cade]]'' (1961), in which she played a missionary nurse tempted by lust, and the title role in Jean Negulesco's ''[[Jessica (film)|Jessica]]'' (1962) with [[Maurice Chevalier]], in which she played a young midwife resented by the married women of the town. Angie would also share the screen with friend [[Gregory Peck]] in the comedy-drama ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963).

In ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964), a film originally intended to be the very first made-for-television movie but released to theatres due to its violent content, Dickinson played a femme fatale opposite future U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] in his last movie role. Directed by [[Don Siegel]], it was a remake of the 1946 version based on a story by [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref>http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=177271&apid=39870 "Biography for Don Siegel" retrieved September 3, 2009</ref>

Dickinson co-starred in the comedy ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'' (1965), in which she played the love interest of both [[James Garner]] and [[Dick Van Dyke]]. She appeared in a star-studded [[Arthur Penn]]/[[Sam Spiegel]] production, ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'' (1966), along with [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Robert Duvall]]. That same year she appeared in ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]'' with [[Kirk Douglas]].

Dickinson's best movie of this era was arguably [[John Boorman]]'s cult classic ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' (1967), a lurid crime drama with [[Lee Marvin]] as a criminal betrayed by his wife and best friend and out for revenge. The film epitomized the stark urban mood of the period, and its reputation has grown through the years.

Westerns would continue to be a part of her work in 1969, when she starred in ''[[Young Billy Young]]'' with [[Robert Mitchum]], and in ''[[Sam Whiskey]]'', where she gave a young [[Burt Reynolds]] his first on-screen kiss.

In 1971, she played a lascivious substitute high school teacher in the dark comedy ''[[Pretty Maids All in a Row]]'' for director [[Roger Vadim]] and writer-producer [[Gene Roddenberry]], in which her character seduces a sexually inexperienced student, portrayed by [[John David Carson]], against the backdrop of a series of murders of female students at the same high school; it was a box-office failure. In 1972, she played in ''[[The Outside Man]]'', a French movie shot in LA, with [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], directed by [[Jacques Deray]]. In this movie she plays the wife of a mobster. In 1973, she co-starred with [[Roy Thinnes]] in the supernatural thriller ''The Norliss Tapes,'' a TV-movie produced and directed by [[Dan Curtis]]. One of Dickinson's best known and most sexually provocative movie roles was the tawdry widow Wilma McClatchie from the Great Depression romp ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'' (1974) with [[William Shatner]] and [[Tom Skerritt]]. Although well into her forties at the time, she appeared nude in several scenes, which created interest in the movie and a new generation of male fans for Dickinson.

A 1966 [[Esquire magazine]] cover also gained Dickinson fame and notoriety, her having posed in nothing but a sweater and a pair of panty hose. The photo became so iconic that, while celebrating the magazine's 70th anniversary in 2003, the Dickinson pose was recreated for the cover by [[Britney Spears]].

===''Police Woman''===
[[File:Angie Dickinson police woman 1975.jpg|thumb|150px|Dickinson as Pepper Anderson, 1975 in [[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]]]
Dickinson returned to the small screen in March 1974 to play lead in an episode of the critically acclaimed hit anthology series ''[[Police Story (TV series)|Police Story]]''. That one guest appearance proved to be so popular that [[NBC]] offered Dickinson her own television show which became a ground-breaking weekly police series called ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''; it was the first successful dramatic television series to feature a woman in the title role. At first, Dickinson was reluctant to accept the role, but when producers told her she could become a household name she accepted the role.

In the series, she played Sgt. Leann "Pepper" Anderson, an officer of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s Criminal Conspiracy Unit. The show became a hit, reaching number one in many countries in which it aired during its first year. It ran for four seasons and Dickinson would win a [[Golden Globe]] award, and receive [[Emmy]] nominations for three consecutive years.

Co-starring on the show was [[Earl Holliman]] as Sergeant Bill Crowley, Anderson's commanding officer, along with [[Charles Dierkop]] as investigator Pete Royster and [[Ed Bernard]] as investigator Joe Styles.

The series ran from 1974 to 1978. The same year the show ended, Dickinson reprised her Pepper Anderson character on the television special ''Ringo'', co-starring with [[Ringo Starr]] and [[John Ritter]]. She also parodied the part in the 1975 and 1979 [[Bob Hope]] Christmas Specials for NBC. She would do the same years later on the 1987 Christmas episode of NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

''Police Woman'' caused a surge of applications for employment from women to police departments around the United States; journalists who have in recent years examined the inspiration for long-term female law enforcement officials to adopt this vocation as their own have been surprised by how often Dickinson's ''Police Woman'' has been referenced.<ref>[[Police Woman (TV series)]]</ref>

Dickinson and ''Police Woman'' proved that a female lead could carry an hour-long television series, paving the way for several female-starring, hour-long TV series during the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' and ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]''. In 1987, the Los Angeles Police Department awarded Dickinson an honorary doctorate, which led her to quip, "Now you can call me Doctor Pepper."

On occasion during the 1970s, Dickinson took part in the popular ''[[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' on television, and herself was the guest of honor on August 2, 1977, roasted by a dais of celebrities that included [[James Stewart]], [[Orson Welles]] and her ''Police Woman'' series co-star Earl Holliman.

===The 1980s===
After appearing in the television mini-series ''Pearl'' (1978), Dickinson returned to the big screen in Brian De Palma's erotic thriller ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980). The role of Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated New York housewife, earned her a 1981 [[Saturn Award]] for Best Actress.

She took a less substantial role in 1981's ''[[Death Hunt]]'', reuniting her with Lee Marvin, and also appeared in ''[[Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen]]''. Earlier that year, she had been the first choice to play the character [[Krystle Carrington]] on the television series ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'' but, deciding she wanted to spend more time with her daughter, she turned it down; the role instead went to [[Linda Evans]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/angie-dickinson/bio/139844|title=Angie Dickison Biography|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2011-08-03}}</ref> In the mid-1980s Dickinson declined the role of Sable Colby on the Dynasty spin-off, ''[[The Colbys]].''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20092868,00.html |title=British Beauty Stephanie Beacham Sizzles in Sable as Consort to Charlton Heston on the Colbys|last=Wallace|first=David|date=February 3, 1986|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=2011-08-03}}</ref>

After nixing her own [[Johnny Carson]]-produced prospective sitcom, ''The Angie Dickinson Show'' in 1980 after only two episodes had been shot because she did not feel she was funny enough, the private-eye series ''Cassie & Co.'' became her unsuccessful attempt at a television comeback. She then starred in several television movies, such as ''One Shoe Makes It Murder'' (1982), ''Jealousy'' (1984), ''A Touch of Scandal'' (1984), and ''Stillwatch'' (1987). She also had a pivotal role in the highly rated mini-series ''[[Hollywood Wives (miniseries)|Hollywood Wives]]'' (1985), based on a novel by [[Jackie Collins]].

In 1982, and again in 1986, Dickinson appeared in two of [[Perry Como]]'s Christmas specials for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network, in both of which she did something she was not known to have done before: singing. The specials in which she appeared, and in which she sang songs, were ''Perry Como's Christmas In Paris,'' produced on location in Paris, France, which was transmitted on Saturday, December 18, 1982, and ''The Perry Como Christmas Special,'' produced on location in San Antonio, Texas, and transmitted on Saturday, December 6, 1986. As of early January of 2013, these two specials were not known to be available on home video.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Dickinson later denied having sung on camera since then in an interview with [[Larry King]] conducted at the approximate time of her appearance in ''[[Duets (film)|Duets]].''{{Episode needed|date=January 2013}}

In motion pictures, Dickinson reprised her role as Wilma McClatchie for ''Big Bad Mama II'' (1987) and completed the television movie ''[[Kojak]]: Fatal Flaw,'' in which she was reunited with [[Telly Savalas]]. She co-starred with [[Willie Nelson]] and numerous buddies in the 1988 television western ''[[Once Upon a Texas Train]]''.

===1990s and 2000s===
In the 1993 ABC miniseries ''[[Wild Palms]]'', produced by [[Oliver Stone]], she was the sadistic, militant sister of Senator Tony Kruetzer, played by [[Robert Loggia]]. That same year, she starred as a ruthless Montana spa owner in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'' with [[Uma Thurman]].

In 1995, [[Sydney Pollack]] cast her as the prospective mother-in-law of [[Greg Kinnear]] in the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' starring [[Harrison Ford]], a remake of the [[Billy Wilder]] [[Sabrina (1954 film)|classic]]. She also played Burt Reynolds' wife in the thriller ''[[The Maddening]]'' and the mother of Rick Aiello and [[Robert Cicchini]] in the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' comedy ''[[The Don's Analyst]].'' In 1997, she also seduced old flame Artie ([[Rip Torn]]) in an episode of HBO's ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' called "Artie and Angie and Hank and Hercules."

During the first decade of the Third Millennium, Dickinson acted out the alcoholic, homeless mother of [[Helen Hunt]]'s character in ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000); the grandmother of [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character in the drama ''[[Duets (film)|Duets]]'' (2000), and the mother of [[Arliss Howard]]'s character in ''[[Big Bad Love]]'' (2001), co-starring [[Debra Winger]].

Having appeared in the original ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'' (1960) with good friends [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]], four decades later she made a brief cameo in the 2001 remake with [[George Clooney]] and [[Brad Pitt]].

An avid [[poker]] player, during the summer of 2004 she participated in the second season of [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]].'' After announcing her name, host [[Dave Foley]] said, "Sometimes, when we say 'celebrity,' we actually mean it."

Dickinson is a recipient of the state of [[North Dakota]]'s [[Rough Rider Award]].

In 1999, ''[[Playboy]]'' ranked Dickinson No. 42 on their list of the "100 Sexiest Stars of the Century." In 2002, [[TV Guide]] ranked her No. 3 on their list of the "50 Sexiest television Stars of All Time," behind [[Diana Rigg]] and George Clooney (who tied for No. 1).

In July, 2009, Dickinson starred in a Hallmark Channel film, ''[[Mending Fences]].''

==Personal life==
[[File:Burt Bacharach - Angie Dickinson -baby 1966.jpg|thumb|With husband-composer [[Burt Bacharach]] and new child, 1966]]
She was married to Gene Dickinson, a former football player, from 1952 to 1960. Close friends with [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and [[Catherine Galbraith]], her extensive visits to them and touring when John was American Ambassador to India is amply recounted in Galbraith memoirs including ''Ambassador's Journal'' and ''A Life in Our Times''.

She married [[Burt Bacharach]] in 1965. They remained a married couple for 15 years, though late in their marriage, they had a period of separation where each dated other people.<ref>[http://movies.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?c=188092 Angie Dickinson – Overview – MSN Movies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Their daughter, Lea Nikki, known as Nikki, arrived a year after they were married.  Born three months prematurely, Nikki suffered from chronic health problems, including [[visual impairment]]; she was later diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]]. Burt composed the music of the song ''Nikki'' for their fragile young daughter, and Angie rejected many roles to focus on caring for their daughter. Nikki's parents eventually placed her at the Wilson Center, a psychiatric residential treatment facility for adolescents in [[Faribault, Minnesota|Faribault]], Minnesota,<ref name=ballad>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2134839.ece Asperger's syndrome: The ballad of Nikki Bacharach], [[The Independent]], January 8, 2007</ref> where she remained for nine years. Later, Nikki studied geology at [[California Lutheran University]], but her poor eyesight prevented her from pursuing a career in that field.

On January 4, 2007, Nikki killed herself by suffocation in her apartment in the [[Ventura County]] suburb of [[Thousand Oaks]]. She was 40.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501705.html Burt Bacharach's daughter commits suicide], [[The Washington Post]], January 5, 2007</ref><ref name=fox>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242387,00.html Burt Bacharach, Angie Dickinson's Daughter Commits Suicide], January 08, 2007, [[Fox News]]</ref> In a joint statement, Dickinson and Bacharach said, "She quietly and peacefully committed suicide to escape the ravages to her brain brought on by [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's]]&nbsp;... She loved kitties, earthquakes, [[glacial calving]], meteor showers, science, blue skies and sunsets, and Tahiti. She was one of the most beautiful creatures created on this earth, and she is now in the white light, at peace."<ref name=ballad />
