'''Danny Kaye''' (born '''David Daniel Kaminsky'''; January 18, 1911&nbsp;– March 3, 1987) was an American actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. His performances featured [[physical comedy]], idiosyncratic [[pantomime]]s, and rapid-fire [[Novelty song|nonsense songs]].

Kaye starred in 17 movies, notably ''[[The Kid from Brooklyn]]'' (1946), ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947), ''[[The Inspector General (film)|The Inspector General]]'' (1949), ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'' (1952), ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954), and ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956). His films were popular, especially his bravura performances of patter songs and favorites such as "[[Inchworm (song)|Inchworm]]" and "The Ugly Duckling". He was the first ambassador-at-large of [[UNICEF]] in 1954 and received the [[Legion of Honour|French Legion of Honor]] in 1986 for his years of work with the organization.<ref name=Honor>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=njEuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q9YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3376,2978120&dq=danny+kaye+french+legion+of+honor&hl=en|title=French Honor Danny Kaye|date=26 February 1986|publisher=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>

==Early years==
'''David Daniel Kaminsky''' was born to [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Jewish]] immigrants in [[Brooklyn]] on January 18, 1911 (though he would later say 1913).<ref name="DK Interview">Dena Kaye interview on TCM January 18, 2013.

Kaye was born the youngest of three boys for Jacob and Clara Nemerovsky Kaminsky. Jacob and Clara and their two sons, Larry and Mac, left [[Dnipropetrovsk|Yekaterinoslav]] two years before his birth; he was the only son born in the United States.<ref name=Clowns>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&pg=PA247&dq=danny+kaye+cooking#v=onepage&q=danny%20kaye&f=false|title=The Great Clowns of American Television|editor-last=Adir|editor-first=Karen|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2001|pages=270|isbn=0-7864-1303-4|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref>

He attended Public School 149 in [[East New York, Brooklyn]] — which eventually was renamed to honor him<ref name=School>{{cite web|title=Welcome P.S. 149 Danny Kaye|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/schoolportals/19/k149/default.htm|publisher=NY City Dept of Education|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>—where he began entertaining his classmates with songs and jokes,<ref name="Bio">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kO5VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dOEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7184,629748&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en|title=World-renown comedian dies|date=March 4, 1987|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref> — before moving to [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Thomas Jefferson High School]], though he never graduated.<ref name=Conversation/>

His mother died when he was in his early teens. Not long after his mother's death, Kaye and his friend Louis ran away to Florida. Kaye sang while Louis played the guitar; the pair eked out a living for a while. When Kaye returned to New York, his father did not pressure him to return to school or work, giving his son the chance to mature and discover his own abilities.<ref name=Life/> Kaye said that as a young boy he had wanted to be a surgeon, but there was no chance of the family affording a medical school education.<ref name=Clowns/><ref name=Wife>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jGxQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4g8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7347,4079273&dq=sylvia+fine+dena&hl=en|title=Mrs. Danny Kaye Proves a Genius|author=Battelle, Phyllis|date=May 8, 1959|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref>

He held a succession of jobs after leaving school, as a [[soda jerk]], insurance investigator, and office clerk. Most ended with his being fired. He lost the insurance job when he made an error that cost the insurance company $40,000. The dentist who hired him to look after his office at lunch hour did the same when he found Kaye using his [[Dental drill|drill]] on the office woodwork.<ref name=Clowns/><ref name=Time>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776720-1,00.html|title=Git Gat Gittle|date=March 11, 1946|publisher=Time.com|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}</ref> He learned his trade in his teenage years in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] as a [[tummler]] in the [[Borscht Belt]].<ref name="Bio"/>

Kaye's first break came in 1933 when he joined the "Three [[wikt:terpsichorean|Terpsichoreans]]", a vaudeville dance act. They opened in [[Utica, New York]], where he used the name '''Danny Kaye''' for the first time.<ref name="Bio"/> The act toured the United States, then performed in [[Asia]] with the show ''La Vie Paree''.<ref name=Dena/> The troupe left for a six-month tour of the [[Far East]] on February 8, 1934. While they were in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]], a [[typhoon]] hit the city. The hotel where Kaye and his colleagues stayed suffered heavy damage; a piece of the hotel's [[cornice]] was hurled into Kaye's room by the strong wind, nearly killing him. By performance time that evening, the city was in the grip of the storm. There was no power, and the audience was restless and nervous. To calm them, Kaye went on stage, holding a flashlight to illuminate his face, and sang every song he could recall as loudly as he was able.<ref name=Clowns/> The experience of trying to entertain audiences who did not speak English inspired him to the pantomime, gestures, songs, and facial expressions that eventually made his reputation.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name=Time/> Sometimes he found pantomime necessary when ordering a meal. Kaye's daughter, Dena, tells a story her father related about being in a restaurant in China and trying to order chicken. Kaye flapped his arms and clucked, giving the waiter an imitation of a chicken. The waiter nodded in understanding, bringing Kaye two eggs. His interest in cooking began on the tour.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name=Dena>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OwBKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LB4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2332,3334403&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en|title=Life With My Zany Father-Danny Kaye|author=Kaye, Dena|date=January 19, 1969|publisher=Tri City Herald|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref>

When Kaye returned to the United States, jobs were in short supply and he struggled for bookings. One job was working in a burlesque revue with [[fan dance]]r [[Sally Rand]]. After the dancer dropped a fan while trying to chase away a fly, Kaye was hired to watch the fans so they were always held in front of her.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name=Time/>

==Career==
[[File:Hans Christian Andersen FilmPoster.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Film poster 1952]]
Danny Kaye made his film debut in a 1935 comedy [[Short subject|short]] ''Moon Over Manhattan''. In 1937 he signed with New York–based [[Educational Pictures]] for a series of two-reel comedies. Kaye usually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking Russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls [[June Allyson]] or [[Imogene Coca]]. The Kaye series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. He was working in the Catskills in 1937 under the name '''Danny Kolbin'''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/images/vc53ap1.jpg|title="Highlights and Shadows"-front of program|date=July 4, 1937|publisher=The President Players|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/images/vc53ap2.jpg|title="Highlights and Shadows" - inside of program|date=July 4, 1937|publisher=The President Players|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>

His next venture was a short-lived Broadway show, with [[Sylvia Fine]] as the pianist, lyricist and composer. The ''Straw Hat Revue'' opened on September 29, 1939, and closed after ten weeks, but critics took notice of Kaye's work.<ref name=Clowns/><ref name=TV>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T9paAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uWwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5291,8225005&dq=sylvia+fine&hl=en|title=Who Is Sylvia?|date=October 30, 1960|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref> The reviews brought an offer for both Kaye and his bride, Sylvia, to work at [[La Martinique]], a New York City nightclub. Kaye performed with Sylvia as his accompanist. At La Martinique, playwright [[Moss Hart]] saw Danny perform, which led to Hart casting him in his hit [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] comedy ''[[Lady in the Dark]]''.<ref name=Clowns/><ref name=Time/>

Kaye scored a triumph at age 30 in 1941, playing Russell Paxton in ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'', starring [[Gertrude Lawrence]]. His show-stopping number was "[[Tchaikovsky (song)|Tchaikovsky]]", by [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], in which he sang the names of a string of [[Russia]]n composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath.<ref name="Star"/><ref name= King>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rkIqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_E4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3849,3453774&dq=sylvia+fine+dena&hl=en|title=Danny Kaye: King of Comedy|last=Remington|first=Fred|date=January 12, 1964|work=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref> In the next Broadway season, he was the star of a show about a young man who is drafted, called ''[[Let's Face It!]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X7EtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ppgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4949,1337710&dq=eve+arden+danny+kaye&hl=en|title=Danny Kaye as Musical Draftee Brightens the Broadway Scene|last=Edel|first=Leon|date=November 8, 1941|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

Kaye starred in several movies with actress [[Virginia Mayo]] in the 1940s, and is known for films such as ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947), ''[[The Inspector General (film)|The Inspector General]]'' (1949), ''[[On the Riviera]]'' (1951) co-starring [[Gene Tierney]], ''[[Knock on Wood (1954 film)|Knock on Wood]]'' (1954), ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954, in a role intended for [[Fred Astaire]], then [[Donald O'Connor]]), ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956), and ''[[Merry Andrew (film)|Merry Andrew]]'' (1958). Kaye starred in two pictures based on biographies, ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'' (1952) the [[Denmark|Danish]] story-teller, and ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' (1959) about [[jazz]] pioneer [[Red Nichols]]. His wife, writer/lyricist Sylvia Fine, wrote many tongue-twisting songs for which Kaye became famous.<ref name=Wife/><ref name=Fine/> She was an associate producer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AH4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8pgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5142,2228369&dq=sylvia+fine&hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Film Set at Warners|author=Brady, Thomas F.|date=November 13, 1947|publisher=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref> Some of Kaye's films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both Danny Kaye) being mistaken for each other, to comic effect.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Kaye teamed with the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) on Decca Records in 1947, producing the number-three Billboard smash hit "[[Civilization (1947 song)|Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)]]". The success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing several hits, including "[[Woody Woodpecker#"The Woody Woodpecker Song"|The Woody Woodpecker Song]]".

While his wife wrote Kaye's material, there was much that was unwritten, springing from the mind of Danny Kaye, often while performing. Kaye had one character he never shared with the public; Kaplan, the owner of an [[Akron, Ohio]] rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. His wife Sylvia described the Kaplan character:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4T01AAAAIBAJ&sjid=FGUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7384,576802&dq=sylvia+fine&hl=en|title=It Happened Last Night|last=Wilson|first=Earl|date=July 4, 1959|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref><blockquote>He doesn't have any first name. Even his wife calls him just Kaplan. He's an illiterate pompous character who advertises his philanthropies. Jack Benny or Dore Schary might say, "Kaplan, why do you hate unions so?" If Danny feels like doing Kaplan that night, he might be off on Kaplan for two hours.</blockquote>

When he appeared at the [[London Palladium]] in 1948, he "roused the Royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned British variety into an American preserve." ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine described his reception as "worshipful hysteria" and noted that the royal family, for the first time, left the [[royal box]] to watch from the front row of the orchestra.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ci41AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_KULAAAAIBAJ&pg=2305,591697&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en|title=Kaye: everyone's favourite|author=Young, Andrew|date= March 4, 1987|publisher=The Glasgow Herald|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TtQMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QGoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1357,1943058&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Won't Talk of Royalty|author=Januzzi, Gene|date=October 23, 1949|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s-orAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XmcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1385,2017653&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Is a Real Showoff|author=Handsaker, Gene|date=October 11, 1948|publisher=Kentucky New Era|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> He related that he had no idea of the familial connections when the [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|Marquess of Milford Haven]] introduced himself after a show and said he would like his cousins to see Kaye perform.<ref name=King/> Kaye stated he never returned to the venue because there was no way to recreate the magic of that time.<ref name=London>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/12/10/1996-12-10_the_many_lives_of_danny_kaye.html|title=The Many Lives of Danny Kaye|author=Bianculli, David|date=December 10, 1996|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref> Kaye had an invitation to return to London for a ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' in November of the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1940s/1948|title= Royal Variety Performance|year=1948|publisher=Entertainment Artistes Benenevolent Fund|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> When the invitation arrived, Kaye was busy with ''The Inspector General'' (which had a working title of ''Happy Times'').

In 1976, he played [[Mister Geppetto]] in a television musical adaptation of ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' with [[Sandy Duncan]] in the title role. Kaye portrayed Captain Hook opposite Mia Farrow in a [[Peter Pan (1976 musical)|musical version of ''Peter Pan'']] featuring songs by [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]].

In many films, as well as on stage, Kaye proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer and comedian.

===Career in music===
[[File:DaveKapp-DannyKaye-1947.JPG|thumb|right|David Kapp and Danny Kaye, Decca recording studio, 1947]]
Kaye was enamored of music. While he claimed an inability to read music, he was said to have [[perfect pitch]]. A flamboyant performer with his own distinctive style, "easily adapting from outrageous novelty songs to tender ballads" (according to critic Jason Ankeny), in 1945 Kaye began hosting his own CBS radio program, launching a number of hit songs, including "Dinah" and "[[Minnie the Moocher]]".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/danny-kaye-mn0000029750/biography|title=Danny Kaye biography at|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>

In 1947 Kaye teamed with the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) on Decca Records, producing the number-three Billboard hit "Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)". The success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing rhythmically comical fare as "[[Woody Woodpecker#"The Woody Woodpecker Song"|The Woody Woodpecker Song]]" (based on the bird from the [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons, and a ''Billboard'' hit for the quartet), "Put 'em in a Box, Tie 'em with a Ribbon (And Throw 'em in the Deep Blue Sea)", "The Big Brass Band from Brazil", "It's a Quiet Town (In Crossbone County)", "Amelia Cordelia McHugh (Mc Who?)", "Ching-a-ra-sa-sa", and a duet by Danny and Patty Andrews of "[[Orange Colored Sky]]". The acts teamed for two yuletide favorites: a frantic, harmonic rendition of "A Merry Christmas at Grandmother's House (Over the River and Through the Woods)", and a duet by Danny & Patty, "[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]".<ref name="ReferenceA">Sforza, John: ''Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story''. University Press of Kentucky, 2000.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

Kaye's self-titled debut album was released in 1949 by Columbia Records, with songs performed to the accompaniment of [[Maurice Abravanel]] and [[Johnny Green]]. The album, described by the critic Bruce Eder as "a bit tamer than some of the stuff that Kaye hit with later in the '40s and in the '50s", failed to attract "nearly the interest of his kid's records and overt comedy routines."<ref name="allmusic_1949">{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/danny-kaye-mw0001447249|title=Danny Kaye 1949 album review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>

1950 saw the release of a single "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts", his sole big U.S. chart hit,<ref name="allmusic"/> and the econd album ''Danny Kaye Entertains'' (1950, Columbia), a more diverse collection, with Kaye going through a set of that made him famous on the radio and in his early movies; most notably "Tchaikowsky".<ref name="allmusic_195o">{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/danny-kaye-entertains-mw0001452035|title=Danny Kaye Entertains record review|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref> Following the success of the film ''Hans Christian Andersen'' (1952), two of its songs, written by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by Kaye, "The Ugly Duckling" and "Wonderful Copenhagen", reached the Top Five on the U.K. pop charts.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 1953, Decca released ''Danny at the Palace'', a live recording made at the New York Palace Theater,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Danny-Kaye-Danny-At-The-Palace/master/471611|title=Danny at the Palace|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref> followed by ''Knock On Wood'' (Decca, 1954) a set of songs from the movie of the same name sung by Kaye, accompanied by [[Victor Young|Victor Young and His Singing Strings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Danny-Kaye-Knock-On-Wood/release/5289812|title=Knock on Wood OST|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>
[[File:Danny Kaye-Nancy Wilson - 1965.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Singer [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]] appearing on his show in 1965]]
In 1956, Kaye signed a three-year recording contract with [[Capitol Records]] which released his single "Love Me Do" in December of that year.<ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/cl14672 Love Me Do/Ciu Ciu Bella]. Record details @ 45cat</ref> The B-side, "Ciu Ciu Bella", lyrics written by Sylvia Fine, was inspired by an episode in [[Rome]] when Kaye, on a mission for the [[UNICEF]], befriended a seven-year-old [[polio]] victim in a children's hospital who sang this song for him in Italian.<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=egoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=danny+kaye+ciu+ciu+bella+billboard&source=bl&ots=i0ajqWM5o8&sig=u0-R3_fJjPXOrzAAQD_AxyEaTW0&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=tR_AVNSmAeXEygPMgIGoBQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=danny%20kaye%20ciu%20ciu%20bella%20billboard&f=false "Kaye Signs 3-Year Pact With Capitol"], Billboard Magazine, December 15, 1956, p. 30</ref>

In 1958, [[Saul Chaplin]] and [[Johnny Mercer]] wrote songs for ''Merry Andrew'', a film starring Kaye as a British teacher attracted to the circus. The score added up to six numbers, all sung by Kaye; conductor Billy May's 1950 composition "Bozo's Circus Band" (renamed "Music of the Big Top Circus Band") was deposited on the second side of the Merry Andrew soundtrack, released in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/merry-andrew-original-soundtrack-mw0000417149|title=Merry Andrew soundtrack|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref> A year later another soundtrack came out, ''The Five Pennies'' (Kaye starred there as 1920s cornet player Loring Red Nichols), featuring [[Louis Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Danny-Kaye-2-Louis-Armstrong-The-Five-Pennies/master/143201|title=The Five Pennies|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s Kaye hosted his own television variety program and had enormous success on Broadway (''The Madwoman of Challiot'', 1969; ''Two by Two'', 1970). He couldn't read a note of music, learning the scores by ear, but regularly conducted world-famous orchestras.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://dannykaye.com/bio|title=Danny Kaye official biography|accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref> Kaye's style, even if accompanied by unpredictable antics (he once traded the baton for a fly swatter to conduct "The Flight of the Bumblebee")<ref name="official"/> was praised by the likes of [[Zubin Mehta]] who once stated that Kaye "has a very efficient conducting style."<ref name="KennedyCenter"/> His ability with an orchestra was mentioned by [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], then conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]].

===Imitations===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Kaye was sufficiently popular to inspire imitations:
* The 1946 [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon ''[[Book Revue]]'' had a sequence with [[Daffy Duck]] impersonating Kaye singing "[[Carolina in the Morning]]" with the Russian accent that Kaye affected from time to time.
* Satirical songwriter [[Tom Lehrer]]'s 1953 song "[[Lobachevsky (song)|Lobachevsky]]" was based on a number that Kaye had done, about the Russian director [[Constantin Stanislavski]], with the affected Russian accent. Lehrer mentioned Kaye in an opening monologue, citing him as an "idol since childbirth".
* [[Superman]] creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] fashioned a short-lived superhero title, ''[[Funnyman (comics)|Funnyman]]'', taking inspiration from Kaye's persona.

===Cooking===
In his later years he entertained at home as chef—he had a special stove on his patio – and specialized in Chinese and Italian cooking.<ref name="Star"/> The stove Kaye used for his Chinese dishes was fitted with metal rings for the burners to allow the heat to be highly concentrated.

Kaye referred to his kitchen as "Ying's Thing". While filming ''The Madwoman of Chaillot'' in France, he phoned home to ask his family if they would like to eat at "Ying's Thing" that evening; Kaye flew home for dinner.<ref name=Dena/> Not all of his efforts in the kitchen went well. After flying to San Francisco for a recipe for sourdough bread, he came home and spent hours preparing loaves. When his daughter asked about the bread, Kaye hit the bread on the kitchen table.

===Charity===
[[File:Amerikaanse filmacteur Danny Kaye arriveert op Schiphol.ogv|thumb|Danny Kaye on a promotion tour for UNICEF in the Netherlands, 1955]]
Working alongside [[UNICEF]]'s Halloween fundraiser founder, Ward Simon Kimball Jr., the actor educated the public on impoverished children in deplorable living conditions overseas and assisted in the distribution of donated goods and funds. His involvement with UNICEF came about in an unusual way. Kaye was flying home from London in 1949 when one of the plane's four engines lost its propeller and caught fire. The problem was initially thought serious enough that it might make an ocean landing; life jackets and liferafts were made ready. The plane was able to head back over 500 miles to land at [[Shannon Airport]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. On the way back to Shannon, the head of the Children's Fund, [[Maurice Pate]], had the seat next to Danny Kaye and spoke at length about the need for recognition for the Fund. Their discussion continued on the flight from Shannon to New York; it was the beginning of the actor's long association with UNICEF.<ref name="UNICEF 2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicefusa.org/partners/ambassadors/danny-kaye/danny-kaye-bio.html|title=Danny Kaye Biography|accessdate=March 23, 2014|publisher=[[UNICEF]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jUIjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2884,742737&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en|title=Crippled Transport Limps to Safety|date=July 8, 1949|publisher=The Lewiston Daily Sun|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_danny_kaye.html|title=Danny Kaye|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

"For all of his success as a performer... his greatest legacy remains his tireless humanitarian work - so close were his ties to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) that when the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize, Kaye was tapped to accept it," according to music critic Jason Ankeny.<ref name="allmusic"/>
