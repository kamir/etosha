'''''The Daily Show''''' (titled '''''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''''' since 1999) is an American [[late night television|late-night]] [[Late-night talk show|talk]] and [[news satire]] [[television program]], which airs each Monday through Thursday on [[Comedy Central]] and, in Canada, [[The Comedy Network]]. The half-hour-long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was [[anchorman|hosted]] by [[Craig Kilborn]] until December 1998. [[Jon Stewart]] took over as host in January 1999, making the show more strongly focused on politics and the national media, in contrast with the [[pop culture]] focus during Kilborn's tenure. Stewart's version is currently the second-longest-running program on Comedy Central, after ''[[South Park]]'', and has won 18 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.

Describing itself as a [[News satire|fake news]] program, ''The Daily Show'' draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often aspects of the [[self-referential humor|show itself]]. The show typically opens with a long [[monologue]] from Jon Stewart, relating to recent headlines and frequently features exchanges with one or more of several [[List of The Daily Show correspondents|correspondents]], who adopt [[reductio ad absurdum|absurd or humorously exaggerated takes]] on current events against Stewart's [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]] [[persona]]. The final segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with [[List of The Daily Show guests|guests]] ranging from actors and musicians to nonfiction authors and political figures.

The program is popular among young audiences, with organizations such as the [[Pew Research Center]] suggesting that 74% of regular viewers are between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watch the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment, compared with 64% who watch [[CNN]] for the news headlines.<ref name=people-press.org>{{cite web|author=Publications |url=http://people-press.org/2010/09/12/americans-spending-more-time-following-the-news/ |title=Americans spending more time watching the news |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |date=2010-09-12 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}</ref> Critics have chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other ''Daily Show'' writers have responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the [[CNN]] show ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' parodied this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.

''[[The Colbert Report]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''The Daily Show'' starring former correspondent [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] premiered on October 17, 2005 and ended on December 18, 2014. Another spin-off series hosted by contributor [[Larry Wilmore]] entitled ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]'' premiered on January 19, 2015, replacing ''The Colbert Report''. ''The Daily Show'' also helped lead to ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'', an [[HBO]] series hosted by former correspondent [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]], who had previously guest-hosted ''The Daily Show'' in the middle of the year before its debut.<ref name="wilmore">{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Larry Wilmore to Take Place of Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/business/media/larry-wilmore-to-take-place-of-stephen-colbert-on-comedy-central.html|accessdate=May 9, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 9, 2014}}</ref>

On February 10, 2015, Stewart announced that he would leave the show; his final broadcast is scheduled to air on August 6, 2015 which will also be the last edition before the show goes on summer hiatus. [[Trevor Noah]], a South African comedian who joined ''The Daily Show'' as a freshman contributor in December 2014, has been named Stewart's successor.<ref name="Noah">{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=Trevor Noah to Succeed Jon Stewart on ‘The Daily Show’|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/arts/television/trevor-noah-to-succeed-jon-stewart-on-the-daily-show.html?src=twr&_r=1|accessdate=March 30, 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 30, 2015}}</ref>

==Format==

===Opening segment===
[[File:Jon Stewart and Michael Mullen on The Daily Show.jpg|thumb|Jon Stewart ''(right)'' hosting an episode of ''The Daily Show'' in 2010 with [[Admiral]] [[Michael Mullen]]]]
Each episode begins with announcer Drew Birns announcing the date and the introduction, "From Comedy Central's World News Headquarters in New York, this is ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.''"<ref name=dailynews/><ref>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003156883|title=Drew Birns, Voiceover Artist|work=Back Stage|date=September 25, 2006|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}</ref> Previously, the introduction was "This is ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,'' the most important television program, ever." The host, Jon Stewart, then opens the show with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. Previously, the show had divided its news commentary into sections known as "Headlines", "Other News", and "This Just In"; these titles were dropped from regular use on October 28, 2002 and were last used on March 6, 2003.

===Correspondent segments===
The monologue segment is often followed by a segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent—typically introduced as the show's "senior" specialist in the subject at hand—either at the anchor desk with Stewart or reporting from a false location in front of a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] showing stock footage. Their stated areas of expertise vary depending on the news story that is being discussed, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Casual Racism Correspondent).<ref>{{cite web|author=Humphrey, Steven|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=39695&category=34029|title=The Best Paintball Movie You'll See All Year!|work=The Portland Mercury|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=July 9, 2008}}</ref> The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme [[stereotypes]] of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as "Senior Latino Correspondent" or "Senior Youth Correspondent". They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against Stewart's [[Double act|straight man]].<ref name=Age>{{cite news|author=Nguyen, Keneth|url=http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2004/01/21/1074360828900.html|title=News Takes a Beating|work=The Age|date=January 22, 2004|accessdate=July 13, 2008|location=Melbourne}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
[[File:John Oliver Wyatt Cenac hug Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Former correspondents [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Wyatt Cenac]] at the launch of ''[[Earth (The Book)|Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'']]
While correspondents stated to be reporting abroad are usually performing in-studio in front of a greenscreen background, but on rare occasions, cast members have recorded pieces on location. For instance, during the week of August 20, 2007, the show aired a series of segments called "Operation Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq" in which correspondent [[Rob Riggle]] reported from Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4130/article-1G1-168145932/green-screen-green-zone-daily-show-goes-iraq-real-and|title=From Green Screen to Green Zone: 'Daily Show' Goes to Iraq&nbsp;– for Real&nbsp;– And Airs First Report|work=Editor & Publisher|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> In August 2008, Riggle traveled to China for a series of segments titled "Rob Riggle: [[Chasing the dragon|Chasing the Dragon]]", which focused on the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bauder, David|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1120579_Rob_Riggle_s_off_the_hook_in_China|title=Rob Riggle's off the hook in China|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=August 11, 2008|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] traveled to Iran in early June 2009 to report on the Iranian elections, and John Oliver traveled to South Africa for the series of segments "Into Africa" to report on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In March 2012, [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] traveled to Gabon, on the west African coast, to report on the Gabonian government's decision to donate $2 million to UNESCO after the United States cut its funding for UNESCO earlier that year.

Correspondent segments feature a rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members traveling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people related to the featured issue. Topics have varied widely; during the early years of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as [[Bigfoot]] enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates.<ref name="Colbert interview"/> Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of ''The Daily Show''. However, since the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.<ref name=Larris/>

===Recurring segments===
[[List of The Daily Show recurring segments|Some segments]] recur periodically, such as "Back in Black" with [[Lewis Black]], "This Week in God" and "Are You Prepared?!?" with [[Samantha Bee]], "Trendspotting" with [[Demetri Martin]], "Wilmore-Oliver Investigates" with [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Larry Wilmore]], "You're Welcome" and more recently "Money talks" with [[John Hodgman]]. Since the early days of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], a common part of the show has been "[[Mesopotamia|Mess O' Potamia]]", focusing on the United States' policies in the [[Middle East]], especially Iraq.<ref name=Kurtz>{{cite news|author=Kurtz, Howard|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55440-2004Oct22.html|title=The Campaign of a Comedian|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 23, 2004|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref> Elections in the United States have been a prominent focus in the show's "Indecision" coverage throughout Stewart's time as host. (The title "InDecision" is a parody of [[NBC News]]' "Decision" segment.) During the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential elections, the show went on the road to record week-long specials from the cities hosting the [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention]]s.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-18-jon-stewart_x.htm|title=Jon Stewart to remain at 'Daily Show'|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> For the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 U.S. midterm elections]], a week of episodes was recorded in the contested state of [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-08-25-daily-ohio_x.htm|title='Daily Show' to take road trip to Ohio|work=USA Today|date=August 25, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> The "Indecision" coverage of the 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 elections all culminated in live [[Election Day (United States)|Election Night]] specials.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/08/05/candidates-daily-show.html|title=Comedic campaign stop: Presidential candidates hit The Daily Show|publisher=CBC News|date=August 5, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> On March 1, 2011, Stewart aired the first installment of Indecision 2012.<ref>[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-march-1-2011/indecision-2012---indecision-edition The Daily Show: Indecision 2012]</ref> On September 19, 2012, Stewart opened with a segment called "Chaos On Bullsh*t Mountain" in which he blasted Fox News for its coverage of a leaked video of Mitt Romney talking about 47 percent of Americans who don’t pay income taxes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-blasts-fox-news-over-romney-video-chaos-on-bullsht-mountain/|title=Jon Stewart Blasts Fox News Over Romney Video: Chaos On Bullsh*t Mountain|work=[[Mediaite]]|date=September 19, 2012}}</ref>

===Celebrity interviews===
In the show's third act, the host conducts an interview with a celebrity guest. Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits and political figures.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2006/12/03/dailyshow-karlin-leaves.html|title=Executive producer quits The Daily Show, Colbert Report|publisher=CBC News|date=December 3, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> Since Stewart became host, the show's guest list has tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials.<ref name=Kurtz/> While in the show's earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians—in 1999, for an ''Indecision 2000'' segment, [[Steve Carell]] struggled to talk his way off Republican candidate [[John McCain]]'s press overflow bus and onto the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|Straight Talk Express]]—it has since risen in popularity, particularly following the show's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 elections. In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described ''The Daily Show'' under Stewart as "the hot destination for anyone who wants to sell books or seem hip, from presidential candidates to military dictators", while ''[[Newsweek]]'' calls it "the coolest pit stop on television".<ref>{{cite news|author=Dowd, Maureen|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors|title=America's Anchors|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 31, 2006|accessdate=August 26, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070818095819/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors|archivedate=August 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="most trusted"/> Prominent political guests have included [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/27/AR2010102709035.html | author = Dana Milbank |title=On the Daily Show, Obama is the last laugh|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2010-10-27 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}</ref> [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2009/11/17/2009-11-17_police_car_ahead_of_joe_bidens_motorcade_crashes_on_way_to_film_daily_show_with_.html |title=Vice President Joe Biden provides few laughs, gaffes on 'The Daily Show' with Jon Stewart |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location = New York |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}</ref> former Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]] [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], former [[Pakistan]]i President [[Pervez Musharraf]], [[Liberia]]n President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], [[Bolivia]]n President [[Evo Morales]], [[Jordan]]ian King [[Abdullah II]], and former [[Mexico|Mexican]] President [[Vicente Fox]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Agencies|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/tony-blair-faces-daily-shows-smiling-inquisition-935635.html|title=Tony Blair faces Daily Show's smiling inquisition|work=The Independent|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=November 18, 2008|location=London}}</ref> The show has played host to former and current members of the Administration and Cabinet as well as members of Congress.

The segment was short-lived, and by the end of 2006 it had been discontinued. Such sports stars as [[LeBron James]] and [[Lance Armstrong]] have also been featured on the show.

===Closing segment===
In a closing segment, there is a brief segue to the closing credits in the form of Stewart introducing "Your Moment of [[Zen]]", a humorous piece of video footage without commentary that has been part of the show's wrap-up since the series began in 1996.<ref name=zen>{{cite news|author=Scott, A. O. | authorlink = A. O. Scott |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/weekinreview/31scott.html |title=Caught Off Message|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> The segment often relates to a story covered earlier in the episode, but occasionally is merely a humorous or ridiculous clip. Occasionally, the segment is used as a tribute to someone who has passed away.

In October 2005, following ''The Colbert Report''{{'s}} premiere, a new feature (sometimes referred to as the toss) was added to the closing segment in which Stewart would have a short exchange with "our good friend, [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] at ''[[The Colbert Report]]''", which aired immediately after. The two would have a scripted comedic exchange via split-screen from their respective sets. In 2007, the "toss" was cut back to twice per week, and by 2009 was once a week before gradually being faded out. It was used once again during [[The final episode of The Colbert Report|final episode]] of ''The Colbert Report'' on December 18, 2014, and returned upon the premiere of ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]''. Stewart and Wilmore have since interacted roughly twice per week.

==Studio==
[[File:Daily Show studio.JPG|thumb|left|Outside of the current ''Daily Show'' studio]]
The program features Stewart sitting at his desk on the [[podium|elevated island stage]] in the style of a traditional news show. The show relocated from its original New York studio in mid-1998 to [[NEP Broadcasting|NEP]] Studio 54 in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, where it remained until 2005, when the studio was claimed by ''Daily Show'' spin-off series ''The Colbert Report''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Huff, Richard|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-08-11/entertainment/18079925_1_daily-show-cbs-insiders-tom-snyder|title=Jon Stewart to Anchor 'Daily Show' Comedy Central Names Comic as Craig Kilborn's Replacement|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location = New York |date=August 11, 1998|accessdate=July 31, 2008}}</ref> On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, a few blocks west of its former location.<ref>{{cite web|author=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122505|title=Colbert set for 'Daily Show' spinoff|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=September 10, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>
The set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests' couch, which had been a part of the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a "Bring Back the Couch Campaign." The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by ''Daily Show'' contributor [[Bob Wiltfong]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Stevens, Dana|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122505|title=Talk Show Feng Shui|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=July 12, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Susman, Gary|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2005/07/daily_show_scan.html|title='Daily Show' scandal: That new set|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 20, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref> The couch was eventually made the prize in a ''Daily Show '' sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show and a small sum of money.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ebenkamp, Becky|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4682113-1.html|title=The Biz: Food Net Unwraps Pop Secrets; Stewart's Sofa Sent to Suburbia|work=Brandweek|date=June 30, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090106100635/http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4682113-1.html|archivedate=Jan 6, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:TDS Studio Entrance.jpg|thumb|The sign over the entryway of the current ''Daily Show'' studio]]
On April 9, 2007 the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sandberg, Marian|url=http://livedesignonline.com/venues/daily_dose/|title=Daily Dose|work=Live Design |date=July 1, 2007|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>

==Production==
The show's writers begin each day with a morning meeting where they review material that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the [[Associated Press]], [[United States cable news|cable news]] television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Stewart—who describes his role as that of a [[managing editor]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvbMfYhLtYc&t=28m49s|title=Jon Stewart on America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction (2004)|date=October 14, 2004|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>—has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal.

The program is rerun several times the next day, including a 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central [[prime time]] broadcast.

[[File:DailyShowKilborn.jpg|left|thumb|[[Craig Kilborn]] hosting an episode of ''The Daily Show'' in 1997]]
''The Daily Show'' was created by [[Lizz Winstead]] and [[Madeleine Smithberg]] and premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, having been marketed as a replacement for ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (a successful Comedy Central program that had moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] earlier that year).<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambert, Brian|url=http://members.tripod.com/~lizzland/news/060897.html|title="Daily Show" is Morning Drive Radio for TV|work=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=June 8, 1997|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Aiming to parody conventional newscasts, it featured a comedic monologue of the day's headlines from anchor [[Craig Kilborn]] (a well-known co-anchor of [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]''), as well as [[mockumentary]] style on-location reports, in-studio segments and debates from regular correspondents Winstead, [[Brian Unger]], [[Beth Littleford]], and [[A. Whitney Brown]] (known for his appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'').<ref>{{cite news|author=Grimes, William|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/tv/wringing-laughs-from-the-real-world.html |title=Wringing Laughs From the Real World|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 9, 1997|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref>

====Common segments====

====Differences between Kilborn's version and Stewart's version====
The show was much less politically focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor.<ref name="Colbert interview"/> Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics".<ref>{{cite web|author=Winstead, Lizz|url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2008/04/qa_with_daily_show_creator_liz.php|title=Q&A With Daily Show Creator Lizz Winstead|work=Westword|date=April 23, 2008|accessdate=July 9, 2008}}</ref> The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged by some of the show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces."<ref>{{cite web|author=Thompson, Stephen|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22599|title=Interview: The Daily Show's Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, and Mo Rocca|work=The A.V.

Bereft of an ideological or artistic center, the show is precocious but empty. }}</ref>

====Craig Kilborn's departure====
There were reports of backstage friction between Kilborn and some of the female staff, particularly the show's co-creator Lizz Winstead. Winstead had not been involved in the hiring of Kilborn, and disagreed with him over what direction the show should take. "I spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers. Somebody else put him in place. There were bound to be problems. I viewed the show as content-driven; he viewed it as host-driven," she said.<ref>{{cite web|author=C.J.|url=http://members.tripod.com/~lizzland/news/020898a.html|title=Winstead walks over crude quips|work=[[Star Tribune]] | location = Minneapolis | date=February 8, 1998|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> In a 1997 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine interview, Kilborn made a sexually explicit joke about Winstead. [[Comedy Central]] responded by suspending Kilborn without pay for one week, and Winstead quit soon after.<ref>{{cite news|author=Carter, Bill|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/17/arts/tv-notes-comedy-host-in-hot-water.html |title=TV Notes; Comedy Host In Hot Water|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 17, 1997|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

In 1998, Kilborn left ''The Daily Show'' in order to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on CBS's ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. He claimed the "Five Questions" interview segment as intellectual property, disallowing any future ''Daily Show'' hosts from using it in their interviews.<ref>{{cite news|author=James, Caryn|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/01/arts/television-review-an-echo-of-daily-show-on-late-late.html |title=Television Review; An Echo of 'Daily Show' on 'Late Late'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1999|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Correspondents Brian Unger and A.

===Jon Stewart era (1999–present)===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DailyShowStewart.jpg|thumb|left|Host Jon Stewart in the studio of ''The Daily Show'' in 2004 {{ffdc|1=DailyShowStewart.jpg|log=2014 July 28}}]] -->

====Shift in content====
Comedian Jon Stewart took over as host of the show, which was retitled ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'', on January 11, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=McConville, Jim|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1999/99_0125electronic.html|title=Jon Stewart: Building His Own House At Comedy Central|work=Electronic Media|date=January 25, 1675|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}</ref> Stewart had previously hosted ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' on [[Comedy Central]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1gy0p_jon-stewart-1991-sast_people|title=Jon Stewart 1991 SAST|publisher=Dailymotion.com|date=March 17, 2007|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> two shows on [[MTV]] (''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' and an [[The Jon Stewart Show|eponymous talk show]]), as well as a syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Howard, Susan|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0000record.html|title=Nighttime Talk, MTV Style|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |year=1994|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}</ref> In taking over hosting from Kilborn, Stewart retained much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like "God Stuff", with [[Joe Bob Briggs|John Bloom]] presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and "Backfire", an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of "This Week in God" and [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[Steve Carell]]'s "Even Stevphen". Since the change, a number of new features have been, and continue to be, developed. The ending segment "Your Moment of Zen", previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show.<ref name=zen/> The show's theme music, "Dog on Fire" by [[Bob Mould]], was re-recorded by [[They Might Be Giants]] shortly after Stewart joined the show.<ref>{{cite web|author=Menconi, David|url=http://blogsarchive.newsobserver.com/beat/index.php?m=20061104|title=The fine print of truthiness|work=[[The News & Observer]]|date=November 4, 2006|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Leopold, Todd|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/12/tmbg/|title=They Might Be Giants: It's OK to call us whatever|publisher=CNN|date=April 12, 2001|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}</ref>

Stewart served not only as host but also as a writer and executive producer of the series. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of ''[[The Onion]]'' [[Ben Karlin]] who, along with fellow ''Onion'' contributor [[David Javerbaum]], joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things "[started] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don't believe."<ref name=Larris>{{cite web|author=Larris, Rachel|url=http://cct.georgetown.edu/research/thesisdatabase/RachelLarris.pdf|title=The Daily Show Effect: Humor, News, Knowledge and Viewers|publisher=Georgetown University|date=May 2, 2005|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}</ref>

Under Stewart and Karlin ''The Daily Show'' developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Then-correspondent Stephen Colbert recalls that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gross, Terry|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title=A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|work=Fresh Air|date=January 20, 2005|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Colbert says that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on "human interest-y" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more "issues and news driven", particularly after the beginning of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] campaign with which the show dealt in its "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]" coverage.<ref name="Colbert interview">{{cite web|author=Plume, Ken|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/433/433111p1.html|title=An Interview with Stephen Colbert|publisher=IGN|date=August 11, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Jacqueline|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title=So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]]|date=May 6, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Stewart himself describes the show's coverage of the [[Florida election recount|2000 election recount]] as the point at which the show found its editorial voice. "That's when I think we tapped into the emotional angle of the news for us and found our editorial footing," he says.<ref>{{cite news|author=Flaherty, Mike|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998822.html |title=Stewart has real flair for fake news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Following the [[September 11th attacks]], ''The Daily Show'' went off the air for nine days. Upon its return, Stewart opened the show with a somber monologue, that, according to Jeremy Gillick and Nonna Gorilovskaya, addressed both the absurdity and importance of his role as a comedian. Commented Stewart:

{{quotation|They said to get back to work, and there were no jobs available for a man in the fetal position. . . . We sit in the back and we throw spitballs&nbsp;– never forgetting the fact that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do that. . . . The view from my apartment was the World Trade Center. Now it's gone. They attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity and strength and labor and imagination and commerce and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.<ref name="Moment" />|Jon Stewart, September 20 broadcast}}

Gillick and Gorilovskaya point to the September 11th attacks and the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as the point at which Jon Stewart emerged as a trusted national figure. Robert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, recalled of this period, "When all the news guys were walking on eggshells, Jon was hammering those questions about WMDs."<ref name="Moment">{{cite journal|author=Jeremy Gillick and Nonna Gorilovskaya|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2008/12/JonStewart.html|title=Meet Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz (aka) Jon Stewart: The Wildly Zeitgeisty Daily Show Host|work=[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]] |date=November–December 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}</ref>

====Broadening the role of the correspondent====
During Stewart's tenure, the role of the correspondent has broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in-studio exchanges. Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a correspondent initially involved "character driven [field] pieces—like, you know, guys who believe in Bigfoot." However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as experts discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen. Colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to be more involved with the show, as it has permitted them to work more closely with the host and writers.<ref name="Colbert interview"/>

====Popularity and critical respect====
The show's 2000 and 2004 election coverage, combined with a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' to new levels of popularity and critical respect.<ref>{{cite news|author=Goodman, Tim|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/29/DDGSO9HI5F17.DTL|title=Jon Stewart, seriously, here to stay|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 29, 2004|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> Since Stewart became host, the show has won 18 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and two Peabody Awards, and its ratings have steadily increased. In 2003, the show was averaging nearly a million viewers, an increase of nearly threefold since the show's inception as Comedy Central became available in more households.<ref>{{cite news|author=Levin, Gary|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-10-06-daily-show_x.htm|title=Stewart elects to skewer recall live on 'Daily Show'|work=USA Today|date=October 6, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> By September 2008, the show averaged nearly two million viewers per night.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Starr|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09252008/tv/jons_got_game_130617.htm|title=Jon's Got Game|date=September 25, 2008|work=[[New York Post]]}}</ref> Senator [[Barack Obama]]'s interview on October 29, 2008, pulled in 3.6&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/31/ustelevision-barackobama|title=Barack Obama gives Daily Show biggest ever audience|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 1, 2008|location=London|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|date=October 31, 2008 | quote = Obama's interview, which aired between 11pm and 11.30pm, EST, pulled in 3.6 million viewers in the US - beating the show's previous high when the Democrat presidential candidate's wife Michelle appeared on October 8 by 600,000 viewers. }}</ref>

====In the political spectrum====
The move towards greater involvement in political issues and the increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where the views of the show fit in the political spectrum. [[Adam Clymer]], among many others, has argued that ''The Daily Show'' is more critical of Republicans than Democrats.<ref name=Wilson>{{cite news|author=Wilson, Brad|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,126226,00.html|title=Late-Night Leaning?|date=July 20, 2004|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref> Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election,<ref>{{cite web|title=No Joke: Jon Stewart Takes Aim At 24-Hour Cable News 'Beast'|author=Kurtz, Howard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/25/ST2008082503384.html|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> says that the show does have a more liberal point of view, but that it is not "a liberal organization" with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny. He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an "equal opportunity offender", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because "I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not."<ref name=tease>{{cite news|author=Younge, Gary|work=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/oct/01/usa.television|title=Such A Tease|accessdate=April 10, 2007|location=London|date=October 1, 2005}}</ref> In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that ''The Daily Show'' is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat,<ref>{{cite web|title=''Show'' Off|author=Bierly, Mandi|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,677356,00.html|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> said in an interview during the Bush Administration, when the Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate: "We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power it would be easier to attack them, but Republicans have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it."<ref>{{cite web|author=Berkowitz, Elana and Schiller, Amy|publisher=[[Campus Progress]]|url=http://www.campusprogress.org/features/375/five-minutes-with-stephen-colbert|title=Five Minutes With: Stephen Colbert|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>

Stewart is critical of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians for being weak, timid, or ineffective. He said in an interview with Larry King, prior to the 2006 elections, "I honestly don't feel that [the Democrats] make an impact. They have forty-nine percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go, 'Guys, pick up your game.'"<ref name=transcripts1>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html|title=Larry King Live Transcript: Interview With Jon Stewart|publisher=CNN|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=July 12, 2008}}</ref>  He has targeted them for failing to effectively stand on some issues, such as the war in Iraq, describing them as "incompetent" and "unable... to locate their asses, even when presented with two hands and a special ass map."<ref>{{cite web |work=The Daily Show |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=83638&title=withdrawal-method|title=Withdrawal Method|date=March 13, 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}</ref>

Karlin, then the show's [[executive producer]], said in a 2004 interview that while there is a collective sensibility among the staff which, "when filtered through Jon and the correspondents, feels uniform," the principal goal of the show is comedy. "If you have a legitimately funny joke in support of the notion that gay people are an affront to God, we'll put that motherfucker on!"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Zulkey |url=http://www.zulkey.com/diary_archive_111904.html|title=The Ben Karlin Interview: Just Under Twenty Questions|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref>

After the [[United States Senate]] failed to pass and the media failed to cover the [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]], which would provide health monitoring and financial aid to sick first responders of the [[September 11 attacks]], Stewart dedicated the entire December 16, 2010, broadcast to the issue. During the next week, a revived version of the bill gained new life, with the potential of being passed before the winter recess.<ref>Newton-Small, Jay.

====Writers' strike====
Due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], the show went on [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] on November 5, 2007. Although the strike continued until February 2008, the show returned to air on January 7, 2008, without its staff of writers. In solidarity with the writers, the show was referred to as '''''A Daily Show with Jon Stewart''''' rather than ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,'' until the end of the strike.<ref name="Introducing A Daily Show">{{cite episode|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=147108&title=introducing-a-daily-show|title=Introducing A Daily Show|episodelink=|series=The Daily Show|airdate=2008-01-07|season=13|number=}}</ref> As a member of the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writers Guild of America]], Stewart was barred from writing any material for the show himself which he or his writers would ordinarily write.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Daily Show to return in January|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7155335.stm|publisher=BBC News Online|date=December 21, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}</ref>  As a result, Stewart and the correspondents largely [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] the show around planned topics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finn|first=Natalie|title=''Daily Show'', ''Colbert'' returning|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b57052_Daily_Show_Colbert_Returning.html|publisher=[[E!]]|date=December 20, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}</ref> In an effort to fill time while keeping to these restrictions, the show aired or re-aired some previously recorded segments, and Stewart engaged in [[Who Made Huckabee?|a briefly recurring mock feud]] with fellow late-night hosts [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] and [[Conan O'Brien]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/  Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud].

====Stewart's retirement announcement====
On February 10, 2015, Stewart announced that he would be leaving the show later in the year.

The show's correspondents have two principal roles: experts with satirical senior titles that Stewart interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a current issue. The current team of correspondents collectively known as "The Best [[wikt:fuck|F#@king]] News Team Ever" includes [[Jordan Klepper]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Al Madrigal]], [[Hasan Minhaj]] and [[Jessica Williams (actress)|Jessica Williams]].<ref name=corr_web>{{cite web|title=News Team Correspondents|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/news-team|publisher=[[Comedy Central|Comedy Partners]]|accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref> Contributors such as [[Lewis Black]], [[John Hodgman]], [[Trevor Noah]], and [[Kristen Schaal]] appear on a less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment.<ref name=corr_web/>  Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role in the creation of their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.<ref name="Karlin chat"/>

The show has featured a number of well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these. [[Scott Dikkers]], editor-in-chief of ''The Onion'', describes it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that "I don't know if there's a better show you could put on your resume right now."<ref>{{cite web|author=Gordon, Devin|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2006/02/13/turning-fake-news-into-real-careers.html|title=Turning Fake News Into Real Careers|work=Newsweek|date=February 13, 2006|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref>  Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 before moving on to a movie career and starring television role in ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]'', credits Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' with his success.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carell, Steve|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/get-smart-at-apple-store-soho/id281781179?i=27324056 |title=Podcast: Stephen Colbert interviews Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway|publisher=Apple|date=June 19, 2008|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref>  In 2005, the show's longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', earning critical and popular acclaim,<ref>{{cite news|author=Coyle, Jake|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2008035067_colbertreport07.html|title=Colbert's "Report" rapport still strong|work=The Seattle Times|date=July 7, 2008|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref> and has been selected to replace [[David Letterman]] as host of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Late Show (CBS TV series)|Late Show]]'' in 2015.<ref name="lateshow">{{cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/04/10/stephen-colbert-taking-over-david-lettermans-late-night-spot/ | title=Stephen Colbert Leaving Character Behind To Take Over David Letterman's Late-Night Spot | work=[[Forbes]] | date=April 10, 2014| accessdate= April 10, 2014}}</ref> [[Ed Helms]], a former correspondent from 2002 to 2006, also starred on NBC's ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' and was a main character in the 2009 hit ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2593&p=.htm|title=Friday Report: 'Hangover' Wakes Up in First|last=Gray|first=Brandon|date=June 6, 2009|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref>

In June 2010, actress-comedian [[Olivia Munn]] began a tryout period on the show as a correspondent.

==Reception==
[[Nielsen ratings|Television ratings]] from 2008 show that the program generally drew 1.45 to 1.6 million viewers nightly, a high figure for cable television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/stewarts_ratings_down_15_colbe.html|title=Jon Stewart's Nielsen Ratings Down 15 Percent; Colbert's Up 11 Percent|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=January 2008|accessdate=March 23, 2008}}</ref> By the end of 2013 The Daily Show's ratings hit 2.5 million viewers nightly.<ref>[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2013/04/04/the-daily-show-and-the-colbert-report-finish-1q-2013-as-number-1-and-number-2-among-adults-18-49-and-all-key-young-demos-795303/20130404comedycentral01/ Daily Show Ratings]</ref> In [[demographics|demographic]] terms, the viewership is skewed to a relatively young and well-educated audience compared to traditional news shows. A 2004 [[Nielsen Media Research]] study commissioned by Comedy Central put the median age at 35. During the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]], the show received more male viewers in the 18–34 year old age demographic than ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'', ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' and all of the evening news broadcasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap|title=Young America's news source: Jon Stewart|date=March 2, 2004|publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 22, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060403134904/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap|archivedate=April 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Because of this, commentators such as [[Howard Dean]] and [[Ted Koppel]] posit that Stewart serves as a real source of news for young people, regardless of his intentions.<ref>{{cite episode|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=114993&title=howard-dean-pt.-2|title=Howard Dean interview|episodelink=|series=The Daily Show|airdate=2005-06-23|season=10|number=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=de Moraes, Lisa|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27439-2004Aug23.html|title=Seriously: Kerry on Comedy Central|date=August 24, 2004|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>

The show's writers reject the idea that ''The Daily Show'' has become a source of news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an "age of information [[osmosis]]" in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," he argues. "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'"<ref>{{cite video|people=Jon Stewart|title=A Conversation with Jon Stewart|medium=Video|publisher=Harvard University|location=Harvard Institute of Politics|date=2002}}</ref>

A 2006 study published by [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] tried to compare the substantive amount of information of ''The Daily Show'' against prime time network [[News broadcasting|news broadcasts]], and concluded that when it comes to substance, there is little difference between ''The Daily Show'' and other news outlets. The study contended that, since both programs are more focused on the nature of "[[infotainment]]" and ratings than on the dissemination of information, both are broadly equal in terms of the amount of substantial news coverage they offer.<ref>{{cite news|author=Fox, Julia R., Koloen, Glory and Sahin, Volkan|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m6836/is_2_51/ai_n25010532|title=No joke: a comparison of substance in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and broadcast network...|work=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=June 1, 2007|accessdate=August 21, 2008}}</ref>

As the lines between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under pressure in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. [[Tucker Carlson]] and ''Daily Show'' co-creator [[Lizz Winstead]] have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, "When you are interviewing a [[Richard Perle]] or a [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]], if you give them a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary."<ref name=Winstead>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/2004/05/04_100.html|title=Taking Back the Dial|work=Mother Jones|year=2004|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref>  She has argued that ''The Daily Show''{{'s}} success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show.<ref name=Serious>{{cite news|author=Cave, Damien|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/weekinreview/24cave.html|title=Jon Stewart Gets Serious: If You Interview Kissinger, Are You Still a Comedian?|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 2004|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV.<ref name=avclub.com>[http://www.avclub.com/article/lizz-winstead-discusses-the-most-useless-person-cu-37469 Lizz Winstead discusses the most useless person currently working in news media]</ref>  Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_stewart.html|title=Transcript: Bill Moyers Interviews Jon Stewart|work=[[NOW with Bill Moyers]]|date=July 11, 2003|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>

During Stewart's appearance on [[CNN]]'s [[Crossfire (TV series)|''Crossfire'']], Stewart criticized that show and said that it was "hurting America" by sensationalizing debates and enabling political [[spin (public relations)|spin]]. When co-host Carlson argued that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews and that a "fake news" comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalism. "You're on CNN!" Stewart said, "The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html|title=Jon Stewart's America|publisher=CNN|date=October 15, 2004|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref>  Media critic Dan Kennedy says that Stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange because "you can't interview Bill Clinton, [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]], Bill O'Reilly, [[Bob Dole]], etc., etc., and still say you're just a comedian."<ref name=Serious/>

A 2004 study into the effect of ''The Daily Show'' on viewers' attitudes found that participants had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart, Enemy of Democracy?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/22/AR2006062201474.html|last=Morin|first=Richard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 23, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state that it is not clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2006/05/29/5_30_06__daily_show.html|title=Study focuses on the effect of ''The Daily Show'' satire|last=Ryals|first=Jimmy|publisher=[[The Daily Reflector]]|date=May 30, 2006|accessdate=July 9, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060702193522/http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2006/05/29/5_30_06__daily_show.html|archivedate=July 2, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Rachel Larris, who has also conducted an academic study of ''The Daily Show'', disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, and that it would be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing ''The Daily Show'' and thinking or acting in a particular way.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/05/24/the_daily_show_cause_and_effect.php|last=Larris|first=Rachel Joy|publisher=[[TomPaine.com]]|title="The Daily Show" Cause And Effect|date=June 24, 2006|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref>  Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of [[The Huffington Post]] argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/27/blogophile/main1754241.shtml|last=McNamara|first=Melissa|publisher=[[CBS News]]|title=Bloggers Laugh Over Jon Stewart Study|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=July 9, 2006}}</ref>

Stewart himself says that he does not perceive his show as cynical. "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," he says. "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like [[Fox News Channel|Fox]] and calling it '[[fair and balanced]]'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism."<ref>{{cite news

"We're not the guys at the [[craps]] table betting against the line," he said on ''[[Larry King Live]]''. "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense."<ref name=transcripts1/>

In July 2009, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine held an online poll entitled "Now that [[Walter Cronkite]] has passed on, who is America's most trusted newscaster?"<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/22/time-magazine-poll-jon-st_n_242933.html "Online Poll: Jon Stewart Is America's Most Trusted Newsman"]</ref> Jon Stewart won with 44% of the vote, 15 points ahead of Brian Williams in second place with 29%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timepolls.com/hppolls/archive/poll_results_417.html|title=Now that Walter Cronkite has passed on, who is America's most trusted newscaster?|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref>  Stewart downplayed the results on the show stating "It was an Internet poll and I was the 'None of the above' option".

===Effectiveness as a news source===
In late 2004, the [[National Annenberg Election Survey]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] ran a study of American television viewers and found that fans of ''The Daily Show'' had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers.<ref>National Annenberg Election Survey, ''{{cite web |url= http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf|title=Daily Show viewers knowledgeable about presidential campaign, National Annenberg Election Survey shows |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050308165738/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf|archivedate=March 8, 2005}}'', press release, September 21, 2004.

Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/200/cable-and-internet-loom-large-in-fragmented-political-news-universe|title=Cable and Internet Loom Large in Fragmented Political News Universe|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=October 24, 2006}}</ref>

In a survey released by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both ''The Colbert Report'' and ''The Daily Show'' tend to be more knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of ''The Colbert Report'' and ''The Daily Show'' viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by [[Jim Lehrer]]'s program at 53% and [[The O'Reilly Factor|Bill O'Reilly's program]] at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers.

''The Daily Show'' airs on various networks worldwide; in addition, an edited version of the show called ''The Daily Show: Global Edition'' is produced each week specifically for overseas audiences. It has been airing outside of the U.S. on [[CNN International]] and other overseas networks since September 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998817.html |title=Daily Show Moments That Mattered|author=Staff writer|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref>  This edition runs for half an hour and contains a selection of segments including one guest interview from the preceding week's shows, usually from the Monday or Tuesday episode. Stewart provides an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week's prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present.<ref name=global>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-07-10/entertainment/18203515_1_cnn-international-rena-golden-jon-stewart|title=Jon Stewart's Comedy is Going Global|last=Petrozzello|first=Donna|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location = New York |date=July 10, 2002|accessdate=July 8, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  When aired on CNN International, the broadcast is prefaced by a written disclaimer: "The show you are about to watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through."

Between 2001 and 2006, [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] broadcast small, ninety-second portions of the show to various radio stations across America.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4818518-1.html|title=Inside Media: News of the Market|last=Torpey-Kemph|first=Anne|publisher=Mediaweek|date=February 12, 2002|accessdate=October 31, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In Canada, ''The Daily Show'' is aired on The Comedy Network (a cable channel similar to Comedy Central),<ref>[http://dailyshow.thecomedynetwork.ca/ Dailyshow.thecomedynetwork.ca], ''"The Daily Show" online at The Comedy Network website''</ref> as well as on the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] broadcast network at 12:05am, following late local newscasts. On both channels, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' aired immediately afterwards.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the digital television channel [[More4]] used to broadcast episodes of ''The Daily Show'' Tuesday through Friday evenings with the ''Global Edition'', which is uncensored, airs on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 was the first international broadcaster to syndicate entire ''Daily Show'' episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references.  The program was also available to watch via the internet [[video on demand]] service [[4oD]]. However, the 'toss' to ''The Colbert Report'' was usually included even though it was aired on [[Fox (UK and Ireland)|FX]], another channel.<ref>[http://fxuk.com/shows/the-colbert-report FXUK.com], ''Official FX TV website''</ref> In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When ''The Daily Show'' was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/20/more4-daily-show-stewart|title=More4 cuts back The Daily Show to one episode a week|work=The Guardian|date=December 21, 2010}}</ref>

In Portugal, it airs with no commercial breaks. The Danish national public service network "[[DR2]]" airs both the regular and ''Global Edition'' of the show with no commercial breaks.

In North Africa and the Middle East, the Daily Show has been broadcast since 2008 on [[Showtime Arabia]].

==Spin-offs==

===''The Colbert Report''===
{{Main|The Colbert Report}}
A spin-off, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', was announced in early May 2005. The show stars former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and serves as Comedy Central's answer to the programs of media pundits such as Bill O'Reilly. Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed the idea for the show based on a series of faux television commercials that had been created for an earlier ''Daily Show'' segment. They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot.<ref name=TCR>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-10-13-colbert_x.htm|title=First 'Stewart', Now 'Colbert'|last=Levin|first=Gary|work=USA Today|date=October 13, 2005|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref> ''The Colbert Report'' premiered on October 17, 2005 and aired after ''The Daily Show'' for nine years. Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and less than three weeks after its debut the show was renewed for a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/multimedia/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433787|title=Comedy Central Extends 'Colbert Report'|last=Speight|first=Kimberly|work=Back Stage|date=November 3, 2005|accessdate=July 8, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ''The Colbert Report'' was produced by Jon Stewart's production company, [[Busboy Productions]].

In 2014 it was announced that Colbert would leave Comedy Central to host ''[[Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' on [[CBS]] in 2015, following the retirement of [[David Letterman]].<ref name="A Successor to Colbert Is Named">{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|title=A Successor to 'Colbert' Is Named|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/business/media/larry-wilmore-to-take-place-of-stephen-colbert-on-comedy-central.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> [[The final episode of The Colbert Report|The final episode of ''The Colbert Report'']] aired on December 18, 2014.

===''The Daily Show: Nederlandse Editie''===
A local spin-off of the show called ''{{lang|nl|The Daily Show: Nederlandse Editie}}'' (''The Daily Show: Dutch Edition'') premiered on the Dutch Comedy Central on January 31, 2011. The program is similar to the original, except with Dutch news and a Dutch view on international news. The show is hosted by comedian Jan-Jaap van der Wal, who was a team captain on the Dutch ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', ''[[Dit was het nieuws]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comedycentral.nl/news/the-daily-show/|title=The Daily Show: Nederlandse Editie|publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref> The first episode featured a guest appearance by Jon Stewart (recorded at the New York studio), who gave his official blessing for the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://comedycentral-nl.mtvnimages.com/jj_john_stewart.jpg|title=Jan-Jaap van der Wal with Jon Stewart|publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref> This is also the first and still only franchise of ''The Daily Show''. The 'Dutch Edition' didn't make it past the test run of 12 episodes due to lack of viewers.

===Books===
*''[[America (The Book)|America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]'', published in 2004, is a book written by [[Jon Stewart]] and other writers of ''The Daily Show'' that parodies and satirizes American politics and worldview.
*''[[Earth (The Book)|Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'', published in 2010, is a book written by [[Jon Stewart]] and other writers of ''The Daily Show'' and is similar in style to ''America (The Book)'', but focuses on planet and human culture instead of the history of America.

==Unofficial versions==
''The Daily Show''’s satirical format has inspired international versions unaffiliated with Comedy Central. The [[Persian language|Persian-language]] satire program ''[[Parazit]]'' was directly inspired by ''The Daily Show'' with the hosts even making a guest appearance on the January 20, 2011, episode of ''The Daily Show''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buck|first=James|title=When the Iranian Daily Show met 'The Daily Show,' it was a match made in social media heaven|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/01/when_the_iranian_daily_show_me.html|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In Germany, the ''heute-Show'' has aired on [[ZDF]] since 2009.<ref>http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/fernsehkritik-oliver-welkes-heute-show-funktionierte/1523474.html ({{de icon}})</ref> The name is derived from the main ZDF news program [[heute]].

In Iraq, ''Albasheer Show'' is a reduced version (with no celebrity interviews) and is hosted by the Iraqi journalist/comedian Ahmad Al-Basheer; commenting and criticizing local political issues.
During the 2009 Portuguese legislative election campaign, Portuguese comedy group [[Gato Fedorento]] hosted ''Gato Fedorento Esmiúça os Sufrágios'', a satirical news show modeled after ''The Daily Show''’s election coverage segments, which attracted immediate public attention after securing the key political candidates as guests.<ref>http://www.publico.pt/temas/jornal/gato-fedorento-em-versao-daily-show--entram-na-campanha-eleitoral-17754273</ref>
