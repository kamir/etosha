According to the [[Hebrew Bible]] narrative, Jewish ancestry is traced back to the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical patriarchs]] such as [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], and the Biblical matriarchs [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Leah]], and [[Rachel]], who lived in [[Canaan]] around the 18th century BCE. Jacob and his family migrated to [[Ancient Egypt]] after being invited to live with [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] (who rose to the rank of [[Pharaoh]]'s Vizier) in the [[Land of Goshen]] region by [[Pharaohs in the bible|Pharaoh]] himself. The patriarchs' descendants were later enslaved until the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] led by [[Moses]], which is commonly dated to the 13th century BCE.

Historically, Jews have descended mostly from the tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]], and partially from the tribes of [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] and [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]], who had all together formed the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/307146/Judah Judah: Hebrew Tribe, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']</ref> A closely related group is the [[Samaritans]], who according to their tradition trace their ancestry back to the Israelite tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh,<ref>Knoppers, G.N. ''Jews and Samaritans: The origins and history of their early relations''. "Although interactions of Jews and Samaritans had become contentious by the 1st century CE, the two groups actually shared much in common... Both groups could be found both in the land and outside of the land in diasporic communities. Each groups developed its own synagogues which were so similar architecturally that it can be challenging to tell them apart. Members of both groups professed a pedigree in the same eponymous ancestor (Jacob/Israel). Samaritans claimed to be descendants from the northern tribes of Joseph, representing Jacob's progeny of Ephraim and Menasseh ('eprayim and menasseh), while Judeans (yehudim) claimed to be descendants of the southern tribes of Judah (yehuda)."

The Comfort of Kin: Samaritan Community, Kinship, and Marriage. "Passages in the Cuneiform inscriptions of Sargon II, King of Assyria and Babylonia (722-702 B.C.), unearthed in the mid-nineteenth century in northern Iraq, relate directly to the story of 2 King 17. On the one hand, they confirm its historicity, proving the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel actually took place. The kingdom was indeed transformed into an Assyrian province and was renamed Samerina.</ref>

Its [[Law of Return]] grants the right of citizenship to any Jew who requests it.<ref>A 1970 amendment to Israel's [[Law of Return]] defines "Jew" as "a person who was born of a Jewish mother or has become converted to Judaism and who is not a member of another religion." {{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/Text_of_Law_of_Return.html|title=Law of Return}}</ref> Israel is the only country where Jews are a majority of the population.

According to the Bible, Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in [[ancient history]], first during the periods of the [[biblical judges]] followed by the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]]. After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].

Yehud province was a peaceful part of the [[Achaemenid]] Persian Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to [[Alexander the Great]]. Jews were also politically independent during the [[Hasmonean Kingdom|Hasmonean dynasty]] spanning from 140 to 37&nbsp; BCE and to some degree under Herodians from 37&nbsp; BCE to 6 CE.

==Name and etymology==
{{Main|Jew (word)|Ioudaios}}
The English word ''Jew'' continues [[Middle English]] ''{{lang|enm|Gyw, Iewe}}''. These terms derive from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|giu}}'', earlier ''{{lang|fro|juieu}}'', which had [[elision|elided]] (dropped) the letter "d" from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Iudaeus'', which, like the [[New Testament]] [[Greek language|Greek]] term [[Ioudaios]], meant both ''Jews'' and ''Judeans / "of [[Judea]]"''.<ref>Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Facts On File Inc., Infobase Publishing, 2009, p.336</ref>

According to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition (2000):
<blockquote>It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun ''Jew'', in phrases such as ''Jew lawyer'' or ''Jew ethics'', is both [[Vulgarism|vulgar]] and highly offensive. In such contexts ''Jewish'' is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of ''Jew'' as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as ''There are now several Jews on the council'', which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like ''Jewish people'' or ''persons of Jewish background'' may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Jew|title=Jew|publisher=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]|accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Judaism]] guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a "way of life,"<ref>Neusner (1991) p. 64</ref> which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, Jewish culture, and Jewish identity rather difficult.

Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings, others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to from the religion itself.

==Who is a Jew?==
{{Main|Who is a Jew?}}
[[Judaism]] shares some of the characteristics of a [[nation]], an [[ethnicity]],<ref name="Jews-are-ethnoreligious-group" /> a [[religion]], and a [[culture]], making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/45132 |title=What Makes a Jew Jewish? |publisher=Chabad.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html|title=Who is a Jew?|accessdate=2007-10-06|last=Weiner|first=Rebecca|year=2007|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}</ref> Generally, in modern secular usage Jews include three groups: people who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the religion, those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage (sometimes including those who do not have strictly [[Matrilineality in Judaism|matrilineal descent]]), and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] and therefore are followers of the religion.<ref>{{cite book|title=World Religions: An Introduction for Students|last=Fowler|first=Jeaneane D.|year=1997|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1-898723-48-6|page=7}}</ref>

Historical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Deuteronomy]] 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because "[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2–3}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=2009-01-09|date=September 4, 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318|title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish?|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=Torah.org }}</ref> Since the ''[[Haskalah]]'', these ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.<ref>Dosick (2007), pp. 56–7.</ref>

According to historian [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the Bible. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (''kilayim''). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally.<ref name="J.D. Cohen">{{Cite book|author=Shaye J.D. Cohen|year=1999|title=The Beginnings of Jewishness|publisher=U. California Press|pages=305–306|isbn=0-585-24643-2}}</ref> Second, the [[Tannaim]] may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, [[Mater semper certa est|offspring would follow the mother]].<ref name="J.D.

By the first century, Babylonia, to which Jews migrated to after the Babylonian conquest as well as after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, already held a speedily growing<ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95">[מרדכי וורמברנד ובצלאל ס רותת "עם ישראל - תולדות 4000 שנה - מימי האבות ועד חוזה השלום", ע"מ 95.

Some have claimed that in the first century of the Christian era, for example, the population more than doubled, from four to 8–10&nbsp;million within the confines of the Roman Empire, in good part as a result of a wave of conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+the+fourth+wave%3A+contemporary+anti-Semitism+and+radical+Islam.-a0149590107|title=Beyond the fourth wave: contemporary anti-Semitism and radical Islam|first=Yehuda|last=Bauer|authorlink=Yehuda Bauer|accessdate=2013-02-20 }}</ref>

Other historians believe that conversion during the Roman era was limited in number and did not account for much of the Jewish population growth, due to various factors such as the illegality of male conversion to Judaism in the Roman world from the mid second century. Another factor that would have made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of [[Brit milah|circumcision]], a requirement that proselytizing [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Christianity quickly dropped]]. The [[Fiscus Judaicus]], a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal.<ref name="docs.google.com">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ib2suAQgXxDFZ5zLdag9DMTFCaDPkJrDwResH1I_J4I/edit |work=The Times Literary Supplement|title=Secta and natio|first=MARTIN|last= GOODMAN|publisher=Docs.google.com |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In addition, historians argue the very figure (4&nbsp;million) that had been guessed to account for the population of Jews in the ancient Roman Empire is an error that has long been disproven and thus the assumption that conversion impacted Jewish population growth in ancient Rome on a large scale is false.<ref name="docs.google.com"/> The 8&nbsp;million figure is also in doubt as it may refer to a census of total Roman citizens.<ref>{{Cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=RQgW9NMML4wC&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=roman+empire+jews+8+million&source=bl&ots=L2f2IRsFPU&sig=0RKrm3Icv0IYXEdxHjAFN_UtkyE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J4bRUrTqD8LhsAS12oH4DA&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=roman%20empire%20jews%208%20million&f=false| title = Jews in the Hellenistic and Roman Cities P. 105 | year = 2002| accessdate = 2014-01-11 | publisher = Routledge.

Aside from the Jewish communities of Babylonia and Rome, other Jewish communities were also to be found during that era in North Africa, across the Middle East, in Northern Europe, and in other places.

==Ethnic divisions==
{{Main|Jewish ethnic divisions}}
[[File:Gottlieb-Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ashkenazi Jews]] of late 19th century [[Eastern Europe]] portrayed in ''[[Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur]]'' (1878), by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]]]]
Within the world's [[Jewish population]] there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating [[Israelite]] population, and subsequent independent [[evolution]]s. An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the [[Old World]], often at great distances from one another resulting in effective and often long-term isolation from each other. During the [[millennia]] of the [[Jewish diaspora]] the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments; [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[nature|natural]], and populational. Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in [[Jewish culture|Jewish cultural expressions]] of each community, including [[Jewish languages|Jewish linguistic diversity]], culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.<ref>Dosick (2007), p. 60.</ref>

[[File:1900 photo of a Sephardi couple from Sarajevo.png|thumb|150px|[[Sephardi]] Jewish couple from [[Sarajevo]] in traditional clothing. Photo taken in 1900.]]
Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups: the ''[[Ashkenazim]]'', and the ''[[Sephardim]]'', or "[[Hispanics]]" (Sefarad meaning "[[Spain]]/[[Hispania]]" or "[[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]" in Hebrew, denoting their Spanish, and Portuguese, base). The ''[[Mizrahim]]'', or "Easterners" (Mizrach being "East" in Hebrew), that is, the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews, constitute a third major group, although they are sometimes termed ''Sephardi'' for liturgical reasons.<ref>Dosick (2007), p. 59.</ref>

Smaller groups include, but are not restricted to, [[Jews in India|Indian Jews]] such as the [[Bene Israel]], [[Bnei Menashe]], [[Cochin Jews]], and [[Bene Ephraim]]; the [[Romaniotes]] of Greece; the [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian Jews]] ("Italkim" or "Bené Roma"); the [[Teimanim]] from [[Yemen]]; various [[Jews and Judaism in Africa|African Jews]], including most numerously the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]]; and [[History of the Jews in China|Chinese Jews]], most notably the [[Kaifeng Jews]], as well as various other distinct but now almost extinct communities.<ref name=EJ571>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmelz|first=Usiel Oscar|coauthors=Sergio DellaPergola|editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Demography|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=5|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|page=571|ref=harv}}</ref>

The divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear. The [[Mizrahim]] for example, are a heterogeneous collection of [[North Africa]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]], and Middle Eastern Jewish communities that are often as unrelated to each other as they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are sometimes termed ''Sephardi'' due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are [[Egyptian Jews]], [[Iraqi Jews]], [[Lebanese Jews]], [[Kurdish Jews]], [[Libyan Jews]], [[Syrian Jews]], [[Bukharian Jews]], [[Mountain Jews]], [[Georgian Jews]], [[Iranian Jews]] and various others. The [[Teimanim]] from [[Yemen]] are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.<ref name=EJ571/>

Despite this diversity, Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]). As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the [[New World]] continents, in countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], and [[Brazil]].

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the [[liturgical language]] of Judaism (termed ''l'shon ha-kodesh'', "the holy tongue"), the language in which most of the Hebrew scriptures ([[Tanakh]]) were composed, and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries.

For centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive [[dialect]]al forms or branches that became independent languages.

[[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jews who migrated to the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Due to many factors, including the impact of [[the Holocaust]] on European Jewry, the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world, ancient and distinct [[Jewish languages]] of several communities, including [[Judaeo-Georgian|Judæo-Georgian]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judæo-Arabic]], [[Judeo-Berber language|Judæo-Berber]], [[Krymchak language|Krymchak]], [[Judæo-Malayalam]] and many others, have largely fallen out of use.<ref name=Languages/>

A trickle of immigrants from other communities has also arrived, including [[Indian Jews]] and others, as well as some descendants of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Australia, Chile, and South Africa. Some Jews have emigrated from Israel elsewhere, because of economic problems or disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as [[yordim]].<ref name="Dosick 2007, p. 340">Dosick (2007), p. 340.</ref>

====Diaspora (outside Israel)====
{{Main|Jewish diaspora}}
The waves of [[immigration to the United States]] and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century, the founding of [[Zionism]] and later events, including [[pogroms]] in Russia, the massacre of European Jewry during [[the Holocaust]], and the founding of the [[state of Israel]], with the subsequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century.<ref>Gartner (2001), p. 213.</ref>

More than half of the Jews live in the Diaspora (see Population table). Currently, the largest Jewish community outside Israel, and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in the world, is located in the United States, with 5.2&nbsp;million to 6.4&nbsp;million Jews by various estimates. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in [[Canada]] (315,000), [[Argentina]] (180,000-300,000), and [[Brazil]] (196,000-600,000), and smaller populations in [[Mexico]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and several other countries (see [[History of the Jews in Latin America]]).<ref name="JPPI2007">{{cite web|title=Annual Assessment|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|year=2007|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|page=15|format=PDF}}, based on {{cite book|title=Annual Assessment 2007|publisher=[[American Jewish Committee]]|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php?GroupingId=10142|volume=106|year=2006}}</ref> Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world.

Western Europe's largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in [[France]], home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African Arab countries such as [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] (or their descendants).<ref>Gartner (2001), pp. 410–410.</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] has a Jewish community of 292,000. In [[East Europe|Eastern Europe]], there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million Jews living in the former [[Soviet Union]], but exact figures are difficult to establish. In [[Germany]], the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population,<ref>Jewish community in Germany: [http://zwst.org/cms/documents/178/de_DE/ZWST-Mitgliederstatistik-2012-web.pdf ''Mitgliederstatistik der jüdischen Gemeinden und Landesverbände in Deutschland für das Jahr 2012''], p. 4</ref> despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former [[Soviet Union]] since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|title=Annual Assessment 2007|accessdate=2008-07-03|last=Waxman|first=Chaim I.|year=2007|format=PDF|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|pages=40–2}}</ref> Thousands of [[Israelis]] also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jg-berlin.org/en/service/israelis-in-berlin.html|title=Israelis in Berlin|publisher=Jewish Community of Berlin|accessdate=2012-10-11}}</ref>

Prior to 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the [[Arab world]] (excluding Israel). Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled [[Maghreb]] region, 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]]. Today, around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bdAdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false The Rebirth of the Middle East], Jerry M. Rosenberg, Hamilton Books, 2009, page 44</ref> and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey. A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century, although the only substantial [[aliyah]] came from Yemen and Syria.<ref>Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bW7aNxCGDKQC&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327#v=onepage&q&f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times], 2003, p.327="Before the 1940s only two communities, Yemen and Syria, made substantial aliyah."</ref> The [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]] took place primarily from 1948. The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily in Iraq, Yemen and Libya, with up to 90% of these communities leaving within a few years. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956. The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states, an additional migration of [[Iranian Jews]] peaked in the 1980s when around 80% of Iranian Jews left the country.

Outside Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and the rest of Asia, there are significant Jewish populations in [[Australia]] (120,000) and [[Jewish population of South Africa|South Africa]] (70,000).<ref name=JVIL2006>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html#region|title=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> There is also a 7,000-strong community in [[New Zealand]].

===Demographic changes===
{{Main|Historical Jewish population comparisons}}

====Assimilation====
{{Main|Jewish assimilation}}
Since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their [[Jewish identity]].<ref name=Johnson171>Johnson (1987), p. 171.</ref> Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods,<ref name=Johnson171/> with some Jewish communities, for example the [[Kaifeng Jews]] of China, disappearing entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shavei.org/communities/kaifeng_jews/articles-kaifeng_jews/chinese-jews-reverence-for-ancestors/|title=Chinese Jews: Reverence for Ancestors|last=Edinger|first=Bernard|date=December 15, 2005|publisher=Shavei Israel|accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref> The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see [[Haskalah]]) and the subsequent [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jewish populations]] of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society. The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community.<ref>Elazar (2003), p. 434.</ref>

Rates of [[interreligious marriage]] vary widely: In the United States, it is just under 50%,<ref>{{cite web|title=NJPS: Defining and Calculating Intermarriage|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46252|accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref> in the United Kingdom, around 53%; in France; around 30%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akadem.org/medias/documents/Rapport-Erik-Cohen.pdf|title=Les juifs de France: La lente progression des mariages mixtes|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=November 2002|publisher=Akadem|language=French|accessdate=2012-10-11}}</ref> and in Australia and Mexico, as low as 10%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/communities/show/id/2|publisher=World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour&nbsp;– Mexico|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Mexico.html|accessdate=2005-07-07}}</ref> In the United States, only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate with Jewish religious practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|title=Annual Assessment 2007|accessdate=2008-07-03|last=Waxman|first=Chaim I.|year=2007|format=PDF|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|page=61}}</ref> The result is that most countries in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.

[[File:The Jews the world over love liberty poster.jpg|thumb|upright|[[World War I]] poster shows a soldier cutting the bonds from a Jewish man, who says, "You have cut my bonds and set me free - now let me help you set others free!"]]
The Jewish people and [[Judaism]] have experienced various [[persecution]]s throughout [[Jewish history]]. During late [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] and the early [[Middle Ages]] the [[Roman Empire]] (in its later phases known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) repeatedly repressed the Jewish population, first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan [[Roman era]] and later by officially establishing them as [[Justinian I#Suppression of religions|second-class citizens]] during the Christian Roman era.<ref>Goldenberg (2007), pp. 131, 135–6.</ref><ref>Johnson (1987), pp. 164–5.</ref>

According to [[James P. Carroll|James Carroll]], "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200&nbsp;million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13&nbsp;million."<ref>Carroll, James. ''[[Constantine's Sword]]'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2001) ISBN 0-395-77927-8 p. 26</ref>

Later in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe, further persecutions of Jews by Christians occurred, notably during the [[Crusades]]—when Jews all over Germany were massacred—and a series of expulsions from England, Germany, France, and, in the largest expulsion of all, Spain and Portugal after the [[Reconquista]] (the Catholic Reconquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] were expelled.<ref name="Johnson207-208"/><ref name="Johnson213plus"/>

In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.<ref>Johnson (1987), pp. 243–4.</ref> In the 19th and (before the end of World War II) 20th centuries, the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between "good antisemitism" and "bad antisemitism". The "bad" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The "good" kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/mine/timeline.htm|title=A Catholic Timeline of Events Relating to Jews, Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and the Holocaust, From the 3rd century to the Beginning of the Third Millennium|publisher=Sullivan-county.com|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

[[Islam and Judaism]] have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions.<ref name="Bernard1020">Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20</ref> They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to the Islamic state.<ref name="Bernard1020"/> Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.<ref>Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27</ref> Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by [[Bernard Lewis]] as "most degrading"<ref name=Lewis131/> was the requirement of [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], not found in the [[Quran]] or [[hadith]] but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]]; its enforcement was highly erratic.<ref name=Lewis131>Lewis (1999), p.131</ref> On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.<ref>Lewis (1999), p.131; (1984), pp.8,62</ref>

Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]] in the 12th century,<ref>Lewis (1984), p. 52; Stillman (1979), p.77</ref> as well as in [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic Persia]],<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 17–8, 94–5; Stillman (1979), p. 27</ref> and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as [[mellah]]s beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century.<ref>Lewis (1984), p. 28.</ref> In modern times, it has become commonplace for standard [[Anti-Zionism#Anti-Zionism and antisemitism|antisemitic themes to be conflated with anti-Zionist]] publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish [[Refah Partisi]]."<ref name=Lewis_MEQ>{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/396/muslim-anti-semitism|title=Muslim Anti-Semitism|first=Bernard|last=Lewis|authorlink=Bernard Lewis|work=Middle East Quarterly|publisher=Middle East Forum|date=June 1998}}</ref>

Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The [[history of antisemitism]] includes the [[First Crusade]] which resulted in the massacre of Jews;<ref name="Johnson207-208">Johnson (1987), pp. 207–8.</ref> the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (led by [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]]) and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], with their persecution and ''[[Auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' against the [[New Christians]] and [[Marrano]] Jews;<ref>Johnson (1987), pp. 226–9.</ref> the [[Bohdan Chmielnicki]] [[Cossack]] massacres in [[Ukraine]];<ref>Johnson (1987), pp. 259–60.</ref> the [[Pogrom]]s backed by the Russian [[Tsar]]s;<ref name="Johnson 1987, pp. 364–5">Johnson (1987), pp. 364–5.</ref> as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled.<ref name="Johnson213plus">Johnson (1987), pp. 213, 229–31.</ref> According to a 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Human Genetics]], 19.8% of the modern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry,<ref name="Adams2008">{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Susan M.|year=2008|title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=83|issue=6|pages=725–736|issn=00029297|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.11.007|pmid=19061982|pmc=2668061}}</ref> indicating that the number of [[converso]]s may have been much higher than originally thought.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/world/europe/04iht-gene.4.18411385.html|title=DNA study shows 20 percent of Iberian population has Jewish ancestry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297(08)00592-2|title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula|publisher=Cell.com|work=American Society of Human Genetics|date=December 2008|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

Throughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their [[Land of Israel|original homeland]] and many of the areas in which they have settled. This experience as [[Jewish refugees|refugees]] has shaped [[Jewish identity]] and religious practice in many ways, and is thus a major element of Jewish history.<ref>de Lange (2002), pp. 41–3.</ref> The incomplete list of major and other noteworthy [[human migration|migrations]] that follows includes numerous instances of expulsion or departure under duress:

* Following the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1492, the Spanish population of around 200,000 [[Sephardi]]c Jews were expelled by the Spanish crown and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]], followed by expulsions in 1493 in Sicily (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496.

* When the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Soviet Union collapsed]], many of the Jews in the affected territory (who had been [[refusenik]]s) were suddenly allowed to leave.

====Growth====
[[File:A man prays at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|A man praying at the [[Western Wall]]]]
Israel is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through natural population increase, though the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi]] Jewish communities, whose members often shun [[birth control]] for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth.<ref>Gartner (2001), pp. 400–1.</ref>

Orthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytism to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots. Additionally, while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples.<ref>Kaplan (2003), p. 301.</ref>

There is also a trend of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger [[Jewish identity]] so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been a trend (known as the ''[[Baal Teshuva]]'' movement) for secular Jews to become more religiously observant, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown.<ref>Danzger (2003), pp. 495–6.</ref> Additionally, there is also a growing rate of conversion to [[Jews by Choice]] of [[gentiles]] who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.<ref>de Lange (2002), p. 220.</ref>
