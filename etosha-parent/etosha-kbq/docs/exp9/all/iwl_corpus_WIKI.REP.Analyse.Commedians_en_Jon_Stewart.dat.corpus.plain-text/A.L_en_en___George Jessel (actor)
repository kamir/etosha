'''George Albert Jessel''' (April 3, 1898 – May 23, 1981), sometimes called "Georgie" Jessel, was an American [[Illustrated Songs|illustrated song]] "model," actor, singer, songwriter, and [[Academy Award]]-winning [[movie producer]]. He was famous in his lifetime as a multitalented [[comedy|comedic]] entertainer, achieving a level of recognition that transcended his limited roles in movies. He was widely known by his nickname, the "[[Toastmaster]] General of the United States," for his frequent role as the [[master of ceremonies]] at political and entertainment gatherings.  Jessel originated the title role in the stage production of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''.<ref name=obit/>

==Biography==
Jessel was born in [[the Bronx]]. By age 10, he was appearing in [[vaudeville]] and on Broadway to support his family after his father's death.<ref name=obit/>

His mother, who worked as a ticket seller at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theater]], helped him form The Imperial Trio, a harmony group of ushers to entertain patrons of the theater, with [[Walter Winchell]] and Jack Wiener, using the stage names Leonard, Lawrence and McKinley, in their early teens (such usher-singer groups were common).  At age 11, he was a partner of [[Eddie Cantor]] in a kid sketch and performed with him on stage until he outgrew the role at age 16.  He later partnered with Lou Edwards and then became a solo performer.<ref name=cullen>Cullen, Frank and Hackman, Florence (2006). ''Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America'', pp. 566–68. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-93853-8.</ref><ref>The 1915 New York State Census shows that he was living at 1072 Simpson St. in the Bronx, and his occupation is listed as "performer".  In that census, he is listed as living with his grandparents, Simon and Caroline Schwarz, his aunt Mary Schwarz, and his mother Lottie Jessel.</ref>

===Vaudeville===
His most famous comedy [[sketch comedy|skit]] was called "Hello Mama" or "Phone Call from Mama", which portrayed a one-sided telephone conversation. In 1919 he produced his own solo show, "George Jessel's Troubles" and appeared in his first motion picture, the silent movie ''[[The Other Man's Wife]]''. He co-wrote the lyrics for a hit tune, "Oh How I Laugh When I Think How I Cried About You", and performed in several successful comedy stage shows in the early 1920s. In 1921 he recorded a hit single, "The Toastmaster". He sometimes appeared in [[blackface]] in his vaudeville shows.

===Film and broadcasting===
In 1924, he appeared in a brief comedy sketch, possibly the telephone sketch described above, in a short film made in the [[Lee DeForest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process.<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/G/GeorgeJessel1924.html SilentEra entry]</ref>

In 1925, he emerged as one of the most popular leading men on Broadway with the starring role in the stage production of ''The Jazz Singer''. The success of the show prompted [[Warner Bros.]]—after their success with ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' (1926) with music and sound effects only—to adapt the ''The Jazz Singer'' as the first "[[sound film|talkie]]" with dialogue and to cast Jessel in the lead role. However, when the studio refused his salary demands, Jessel turned down the movie role, which was eventually played by [[Al Jolson]]. According to Jessel during an interview around 1980, Warner Brothers still owed Jessel money for earlier roles and lacked enough funds to produce this movie with a leading star. Jolson, the biographical inspiration for the movie, became the movie's main financial backer.
His next movie role was in 1926 in ''Private Izzy Murphy''. Whereas Jolson's film career skyrocketed after the 1927 release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', Jessel remained in smaller movie roles, often intended for audiences fond of [[Jew]]ish and other "ethnic" humor.

On April 23, 1934 Jessel married [[silent film|silent]] movie star [[Norma Talmadge]], causing a scandal because Talmadge was married at the time that they started their affair, and she obtained a [[Mexican divorce]] only 10 days earlier.<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/people/actresses/Talmadge-Norma.html http://www.silentera.com/people/actresses/Talmadge-Norma.html]</ref> After their divorce on August 11, 1939, he caused another scandal by breaking into her house with a pistol and firing shots at her current lover.

In the middle 1940s, he began producing [[musical film|musicals]] for [[20th Century Fox]], producing 24 films in all in a career that lasted through the 1950s and 1960s. At the same time he became known as a host on the banquet circuit, famous for his good-natured wit aimed at his fellow celebrities. In 1946, he was one of the founding members of the California branch of the [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Friars Club]]. (A recording exists of an example of his "blue" work in front of a stag audience, although it was actually recorded at a roast hosted by the Friars' rival, the Masquers Club.) He also traveled widely overseas with the [[USO]] entertaining troops. As he grew older, he wrote [[eulogy|eulogies]] for many of his contemporaries in Hollywood. He wrote three volumes of memoirs, ''So Help Me'' (1943), ''This Way, Miss'' (1955) and ''The World I Lived In'' (1975).

In the early 1950s, he performed on the radio in ''The George Jessel Show'', which became a television series of the same name from 1953 to 1954.

Jessel was the emcee on the short-lived ''[[The Comeback Story]]'', a 1954 reality show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in which mostly celebrities shared stories of having overcome adversities in their personal lives. He was replaced as emcee by [[Arlene Francis]], but the program soon folded.<ref>Earle Marsh and Tim Brooks, ''The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable Television Shows, 1946– Present,''  p. 237</ref>

Thereafter, Jessel guest starred on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Jimmy Durante Show]]''. In 1968, he starred in ''Here Come the Stars'', a syndicated variety show. However, his attempt to extend his career was undermined by a perception that his style of comedy was outdated, as well as by his outspoken support of the American entry into the [[Vietnam War]] and of conservative political causes.<ref name=cullen/>

He often crossed the era's stereotypical political lines with his support for the [[Civil Rights]] movement and criticism of racism and [[anti-Semitism]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} His outspokenness regarding his political opinions could sometimes get him into trouble. In 1971, while being interviewed by [[Edwin Newman]] on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' on [[NBC]], he repeatedly referred to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "''[[Pravda]]''", the house organ of the [[Communist Party]] in the [[Soviet Union]], and was ejected from the show.

His later film roles included a cameo as himself in ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[The Busy Body]]'' (1967) opposite [[Sid Caesar]], and the controversial musical ''[[Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?]]'' (1969) directed by and starring [[Anthony Newley]]. He also played cameos in other all-star films such as ''[[The Phynx]]'' (1970) and ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'' (1976).

Jessel was included as one of the "witnesses" interviewed in the 1981 film [[Reds (film)]] by [[Warren Beatty]]. To gain perspective on the lives of Jack Reed and Louise Bryant, the two protagonists of the movie, Beatty began filming the "witnesses" as early as 1971. Jessel famously confused the name of [[Emma Goldman]], referring to her first as "Emma Goldberg" and then "Emma Goldfarb" before correcting himself.

Jessel died of a heart attack in 1981 at the age of 83 at the [[University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=George Jessel, Comedian And Toastmaster, Dies At 83 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/25/obituaries/george-jessel-comedian-and-toastmaster-dies-at-83.html |quote=George Jessel, the vaudeville comedian and actor who became known as the ''toastmaster general of the United States,'' died of a heart attack last night while at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center for tests. He was 83 years old. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date= May 25, 1981 |accessdate=2015-01-01 }}</ref> He was interred in the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].<ref>{{FAG|547}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In the 1930s, his personal life kept him in the public eye as much as his movies. In 1940, he married a 16-yearold showgirl when he was 42. He had notorious affairs with actresses [[Pola Negri]], [[Helen Morgan]] and [[Lupe Vélez]] (all detailed in his 1975 autobiography ''The World I Lived In'').  It was around this time, while [[emcee]]ing a vaudeville show in Chicago, he decided to introduce a sister act, The Gumm Sisters, to laughs from the audience. When he reintroduced the singing trio as The Garland Sisters (after [[Carole Lombard]]'s character in the film ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'') the name stuck. Youngest sister Frances named herself [[Judy Garland|Judy]] after a popular [[Rudy Vallee]] song and became the legendary Judy Garland.

==Honors and awards==
In 1969 the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] honored him for his charity work by awarding him the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], a Special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].  For his contribution to the motion picture industry, George Jessel has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1777 Vine Street, Los Angeles, California.
