Despite the negative reception from the [[77th Academy Awards|preceding year's ceremony]], the Academy hired [[Gilbert Cates]] to oversee production of the awards gala.<ref name="Archerd"/> However, in an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', it was revealed that 2005 host [[Chris Rock]] would not return to host the show.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waxman|first=Sharon|title=Chris Rock Will Not Return as Oscar Host|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/movies/redcarpet/09cnd-academy.html|accessdate=April 29, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=December 9, 2005}}</ref> According to a statement released by his publicist, "He didn't want to do it in perpetuity, He'd like to do it again down the road."<ref>{{cite news|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|title=2006 Oscars Won't Rock|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/2006-oscars-wont-51614.aspx|accessdate=April 29, 2014|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=December 9, 2005}}</ref> Many media outlets also speculated that several AMPAS members felt uncomfortable with Rock's disparaging comments about [[Colin Farrell]], [[Jude Law]], and [[Tobey Maguire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chris Rock won't host next Academy Awards|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-12-09-rock-oscar_x.htm?csp=34|accessdate=September 18, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=December 10, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|title=Rock not asked back as Oscar host|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/10/entertainment/et-quick10|accessdate=April 29, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=December 10, 2005}}</ref> Initially, Cates sought actor and veteran Oscar host [[Billy Crystal]] to host the ceremony again.

In January 2006, Cates announced that actor, comedian, and talk show host [[Jon Stewart]], who had previously hosted two consecutive [[Grammy Award]]s ceremonies in [[43rd Annual Grammy Awards|2001]] and [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|2002]], was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vancheri|first1=Barbara|title=Jon Stewart Will Host 78th Annual Academy Awards|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/oscar-watch/2006/01/06/Jon-Stewart-going-from-fake-news-to-real-pressure-as-Oscars-host-1/stories/200601060210|accessdate=June 24, 2014|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Crain Communications|date=January 6, 2006}}</ref> Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, "My wife and I watch him every night.

===Box office performance of nominated films===
For first time since 1996, the field of major nominees favored independent, low-budget films over blockbusters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bates|first=Jim|title=Movies at their best, but has anyone seen them?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/01/news/wb-screens1|accessdate=April 25, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Meil|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/31/news/companies/oscars/|title=Oscar watch: And the cash goes to... |accessdate=April 25, 2014|work=[[CNN Money]]|publisher=Time Warner|date=February 7, 2007}}</ref> The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $186 million with an average gross of $37.3 million per film.<ref name="BoxOfficeMojoOscars">{{cite news|title=2006 Academy Award Nominations and Winner for Best Picture|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/oscar/chart/?yr=2005&p=.htm|accessdate=April 17, 2014|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}</ref> ''Crash'' was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $53.4 million in domestic box office receipts.

===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' lamented that Stewart was more "amusing than funny". He added, "Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome."<ref>{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Rob|title=Tuned In: Oscar opens with class, but ends up a B-movie|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/06065/665912.stm#ixzz30KuRRxfU|accessdate=April 30, 2014|work=Pittsburgh-Post Gazette|publisher=Crain Communications|date=March 6, 2006}}</ref> [[Tom Shales]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' bemoaned, "It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by." He also derided the "piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past" writing that it "squandered the visual luster" of the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shales|first=Tom|title=Memo to Jon Stewart: Keep Yout 'Daily' Job|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/06/AR2006030600029.html|accessdate=April 30, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=March 6, 2006}}</ref> [[Associated Press]] television critic [[Frazier Moore]] complained, "Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar." He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it "distracting and obnoxious."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Frazier|title=Jon Stewart was disappointing host of bland Oscarcast|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/11501211.html#0YQSOBY7BtFcFWxu.97|accessdate=June 25, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|publisher=The Star Tribune Company|date=March 6, 2006}}</ref>

The majority of other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart's performance as host writing that he "did the Oscars proud Sunday night, turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison."<ref>{{cite news|title=Oscar host Jon Stewart is worth the wait|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=March 6, 2006|page=C1}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] lauded Stewart remarking that his opening monologue was "on target, topical and funny," and added, "He was as relaxed, amusing and at home as Johnny Carson."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title='Crash'-ing a joyous Oscar party|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/crash-ing-a-joyous-oscar-party|accessdate=June 25, 2014|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=Sun-Times Media Group|date=March 5, 2006}}</ref> Columnist Ray Richmond of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave high marks for Stewart commenting, "He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious, but on the whole, Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Richmond|first1=Ray|title=78th Academy Awards|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/78th-academy-awards-138261|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=March 6, 2006}}</ref>
