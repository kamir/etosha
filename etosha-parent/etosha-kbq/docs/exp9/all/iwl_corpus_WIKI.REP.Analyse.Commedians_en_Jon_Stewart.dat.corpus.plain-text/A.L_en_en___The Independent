'''''The Independent''''' is a British national morning [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|newspaper]] published in London by Independent Print Limited, owned by [[Alexander Lebedev]] since 2010.<ref name="i2010-03-25"/> Nicknamed the ''Indy'', it was launched in 1986 and is one of the youngest UK national daily newspapers. The daily edition was named ''National Newspaper of the Year'' at the 2004 [[British Press Awards]].  The current editor, [[Amol Rajan]], was appointed in 2013, and its deputy editor, [[Archie Bland]], in 2012.  Bland was one of the youngest people to be appointed to a senior managerial post in the British newspaper industry, at 28 years old.  Rajan was not quite 30 at the time of his appointment in June 2013.

Originally a [[broadsheet]] newspaper, the newspaper has been published in a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] or "[[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]" format since 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-launches-tabloid-version-to-give-readers-a-choice-581355.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=27 September 2003 | title='The Independent' launches tabloid version to give readers a choice}}</ref> ''The Independent'' is regarded as coming from the centre-left, on culture and politics,<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/12/08/papers_ed3_.php U.K. paper follows rivals into tabloid format: At The Times, size matters], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 8 December 2003.{{Dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> but tends to take a more pro-market stance on economic issues.<ref name="Wilby">{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/14/theindependent.pressandpublishing |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=It is.

==History==

===1986 to 1990===
''The Independent'' was first published on 7 October 1986 as a broadsheet.<ref name="Griffiths">Dennis Griffiths (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422-1992'', London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p.330</ref> It was produced by Newspaper Publishing plc and created by [[Andreas Whittam Smith]], [[Stephen Glover (journalist)|Stephen Glover]] and Matthew Symonds. All three partners were former journalists at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' who had left the paper towards the end of [[Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell|Lord Hartwell]]'s ownership. [[Marcus Sieff]] was the first chairman of Newspaper Publishing and Whittam Smith took control of the paper.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glover|first=Stephen|title=The Independent: Reflections on the last 20 years|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-reflections-on-the-last-20-years-418944.html|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 October 2006}}</ref>

The paper was created at a time of a fundamental change in British newspaper publishing. [[Rupert Murdoch]] was challenging long-accepted practices of the print unions and ultimately defeating them in the [[Wapping dispute]]. Consequently, production costs could be reduced and, it was said at the time, create openings for more competition. As a result of controversy around Murdoch's move to Wapping, the plant was effectively having to function under siege from sacked print workers picketing outside.  The new paper attracted staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to his company's new headquarters. Launched with the advertising slogan "It is. Are you?", and challenging ''[[The Guardian]]'' for centre-left readers, and ''[[The Times]]'' as a newspaper of record, it reached a circulation of over 400,000 by 1989.

Competing in a moribund market, ''The Independent'' sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as, within a few years, a price war in the market sector. The market was tight and when ''The Independent'' launched ''The Independent on Sunday'' in 1990, sales were less than anticipated, partly due to the launch of the ''[[Sunday Correspondent]]'' four months before the ''IoS'', although this direct rival closed at the end of November 1990. Some aspects of production merged with the main paper, although still with a largely distinct editorial staff.

===1990 to present===
In the 1990s, ''The Independent'' was faced with price cutting by the Murdoch titles, and started an [[advertising campaign]] accusing ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph'' of reflecting the views of their proprietors, Rupert Murdoch and [[Conrad Black]]. It featured [[parody|spoofs]] of their [[Masthead (publishing)|mastheads]] with the words 'THE RUPERT MURDOCH', 'The Conrad Black', and below, 'THE INDEPENDENT'.

Newspaper Publishing had financial problems. Several other newspapers launched in the 1980s in the industry as a whole had collapsed without winning enough readers to be profitable, and ''The Independent'' was experiencing similar problems. Two European media groups took small stakes. A number of other media companies were interested in the paper. [[Tony O'Reilly]]'s media group and [[Trinity Mirror|Mirror Group Newspapers]] had bought substantial stakes by mid-1994. In March 1995 Newspaper Publishing was restructured with a rights issue, splitting the shareholding into [[Independent News & Media]] (43%), [[Trinity Mirror|MGN]] (43%), and [[PRISA|Prisa]] (''[[El País]]'', 12%). In the same month, Whittam Smith left the paper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In April 1996 there was another refinancing and in March 1998 O'Reilly bought the other 54% of the company for £30&nbsp;million, and assumed the company's debt. Brendan Hopkins headed Independent News while [[Andrew Marr]] was appointed editor of ''The Independent'' and [[Rosie Boycott]] of ''The Independent on Sunday''. Marr introduced a dramatic if short-lived redesign which won critical favour but was a commercial failure, partly as a result of a limited promotional budget. Marr admitted his changes had been a mistake in his book ''My Trade''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/my-trade-a-short-history-of-british-journalism-by-andrew-marr-6161917.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=My Trade: A short history of British journalism by Andrew Marr | date=12 September 2004}}</ref>

Boycott left in April 1998 to join the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and Marr in May 1998, later becoming the [[BBC]]'s political editor. [[Simon Kelner]] was appointed as the editor. By this time the circulation had fallen below 200,000. Independent News spent heavily to improve circulation, and the paper had several redesigns. While circulation improved, it did not approach the level which had been achieved in 1989 or restore profitability. Job cuts and financial controls reduced the morale of journalists, and compromised the product. Ivan Fallon, on the board since 1995 and formerly a key figure at ''The Sunday Times'', replaced Hopkins as head of Independent News & Media in July 2002. By mid-2004, the newspaper was losing £5million a year. A gradual improvement meant that by 2006, circulation was at a nine-year high.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lelic|first=Sarah |url=http://www.mad.co.uk/Logon/ArticleLogon.aspx?uiArticleID=ef7c2624-7002-45f7-96ed-21a040523aef&uiNavigationItemID=&uiPageID=8453a00f-9d1a-404a-beda-339905b6b8b4&PipelinedPage=/Main/News/Articlex/ef7c2624700245f796ed21a040523aef/INM-eyes-emIndependentem-profit.html&PipelinedQueryString=uiArticleID%3def7c2624-7002-45f7-96ed-21a040523aef%26uiNavigationItemID%3dd8f9fd23-813a-47b2-9696-31d9ca23a265%26|title=INM eyes Independent profit|publisher=mad.co.uk|date=19 September 2006}}</ref>

In November 2008, following further staff cuts, a move of production was announced to Northcliffe House, in Kensington High Street, the headquarters of [[Associated Newspapers Ltd|Associated Newspapers]].<ref name="Northcliffe move">{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/nov/28/independent-titles-associated-newspapers-northcliffe-house |title= Independent titles to relocate to Associated Newspapers HQ |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate =28 November 2008 |first=Mark |last=Sweney |date=28 November 2008}}</ref> The two newspaper groups' editorial, management and commercial operations remained separate, but they shared services including security, IT, switchboard and payroll.

On 25 March 2010, Independent News & Media sold the newspaper to [[Russian oligarchs|Russian oligarch]] [[Alexander Lebedev]] for a nominal £1 fee and £9.25m over the next 10 months, since closing ''The Independent'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'' would have cost £28m and £40m respectively, due to long-term contracts.<ref name="i2010-03-25">{{cite news |title=Independent titles sold to Lebedev family company |date=25 March 2010 |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/independent-titles-sold-to-lebedev-family-company-1927436.html |work=The Independent |accessdate =25 March 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref name=bintliff>{{cite news |last=Bintliff |first=Esther |title=Lebedev scoops up The Independent for £1 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4081652-373c-11df-b542-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=20 September 2011 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=25 March 2010 |first2=Ben |last2=Fenton |location=London}}</ref> In 2009, Lebedev had bought a controlling stake in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]''.

==Content==

===Format and design===
''The Independent'' was originally published as a [[broadsheet]] in a series of celebrated designs. The final version was designed by Carroll, Dempsey and Thirkell following a commission by [[Nicholas Garland]] who, along with [[Alexander Chancellor]] was unhappy with designs produced by Raymond Hawkey and Michael McGuiness. At the time on seeing the dummies Chancellor said "I thought we were joining a serious paper." The first edition was designed and implemented by Michael Crozier who was Executive Editor, Design and Picture, from pre-launch in 1986-1994.

From September 2003 it was produced in both broadsheet and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] versions, with the same content in each. The tabloid edition was termed [[Compact (newspaper)|"compact"]] to distance itself from the more sensationalist reporting style usually associated with "tabloid" newspapers in the UK.<ref name="Bus Week">{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004121_9347_db016.htm|title=British papers shrink to conquer|last=Carney|first=Beth|date=1 December 2004|work=Business Week |accessdate=2 May 2009}}</ref> After launching in the London area and subsequently [[North West England]],<ref name="Indy northwest">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-announces-launch-of-compact-version-in-northwest-734372.html|title=The Independent announces launch of compact version in North-west|date=3 November 2003|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=2 May 2009 }}</ref> the smaller format appeared gradually throughout the UK. Soon afterwards Rupert Murdoch's ''Times'' followed suit and introduced its own tabloid version.<ref name="Brand Rep">{{cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/197504/Times-tabloid-pushes-sales-50000/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|title=Times tabloid pushes up sales|last=Billings|first=Claire|date=5 December 2003|publisher=Brand Republic|accessdate=2 May 2009}}</ref>  Prior to these changes, ''The Independent'' had a daily circulation of around 217,500, the lowest of any major national British daily, climbing to claim a 15% rise by March 2004 (to 250,000). Throughout much of 2006, circulation stagnated at a quarter of a million. On 14 May 2004, ''The Independent'' produced its last weekday broadsheet, having stopped producing a Saturday broadsheet edition in January. ''The Independent on Sunday'' published its last simultaneous broadsheet on 9 October 2005, and has since followed a compact design.

On 12 April 2005, ''The Independent'' redesigned its layout to a more European feel, similar to France's ''[[Libération]]''. The redesign was carried out by a Barcelona-based design studio. The weekday second section was subsumed within the main paper, double-page feature articles became common in the main news pages, and there were revisions to front and back covers.<ref name="Guard redesign">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/apr/12/theindependent.pressandpublishing|title=Independent redesign takes it forward|last=Brook|first=Stephen|date=12 April 2005|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=2 May 2009 }}</ref> A new second section, ''Extra'', was introduced on 25 April 2006. It is similar to ''The Guardian's G2'' and ''The Times' Times2'', containing features, reportage and games, including [[sudoku]]. In June 2007 ''The Independent on Sunday'' consolidated its content into a news section which included sports and business, and a magazine focusing on life and culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=37809|title=News magazine look for relaunched Independent on Sunday|author=Dominic Ponsford|publisher=Press Gazette}}</ref> On 23 September 2008 the main newspaper became full-colour and "Extra" was replaced by a "Independent Life Supplement" focusing on different themes each day.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/23/theindependent.pressandpublishing |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Independent goes full colour |first=Oliver |last=Luft |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

Three weeks after the acquisition of the paper by Alexander Lebedev and [[Evgeny Lebedev]] in 2010, the paper was relaunched with another redesign on 20 April. The new format featured smaller headlines and a new pullout "Viewspaper" section, which contained the paper's comment and feature articles.<ref name="pgazette">{{cite web |url= http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=45328&c=1 |title=Independent relaunch |last=Ponsford |first=Dominic |date=20 April 2010 |work=Press Gazette |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> From 26 October 2010, the same day as its sister paper ''i'' was launched, ''The Independent'' started to be printed on slightly thicker paper than before and ceased to be full-colour throughout, with many photographs and pictures (though none of those used in adverts) being printed in black and white only. On 11 October 2011, ''The Independent'' unveiled yet another new look, featuring a red, sans-serif masthead. In November 2013 this was again changed for a vertical masthead in black. It also had new custom fonts and the whole newspaper was overhauled.

===Front pages===
Following the 2003 switch in format, ''The Independent'' became known for its unorthodox and campaigning front pages, which frequently relied on images, graphics or lists rather than traditional headlines and written news content. For example, following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005 it used its front page to urge its readers to donate to its appeal fund, and following the publication of the [[Hutton Inquiry|Hutton Report]] into the death of British government scientist [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], its front page simply carried the word "[[Whitewash (censorship)|Whitewash]]?".<ref name="PR week">{{cite news |url= http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/article/521627/Independent-breaks-front-page-mould-again-earthquake-appeal-coupon |title=Independent breaks front page mould again |last=Whitehead |first=Jennifer |date=12 October 2005 |work=[[PRWeek]] |accessdate=1 May 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 2003 the paper's editor, Simon Kelner, was named "Editor of the Year" at the  "[[What the Papers Say]]" awards, partly in recognition of, according to the judges, his "often arresting and imaginative front-page designs".<ref name="Indy award">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/independent-editor-wins-top-award-from-what-the-papers-say-judges-for-second-time-576954.html |title=Independent editor wins top award |last=Burrell |first=Ian |date=18 December 2003 |work=The Independent |accessdate=1 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref> In 2008 however, as he was stepping down as editor, he stated that it was possible to "overdo the formula" and that the style of the paper's front pages perhaps needed "reinvention".<ref name="Guard Kelner">{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/05/theindependent.pressandpublishing |title=Kelner says it's time to rethink "viewspaper" front pages |last=Brook |first=Stephen |date=5 June 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=1 May 2009 }}</ref>

Under the former editorship of [[Chris Blackhurst]], the campaigning, poster-style front pages were scaled back in favour of more conventional news stories.

On 23 January 2008, ''The Independent'' relaunched its online edition, ''www.independent.co.uk''.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/service/welcome-to-the-independents-new-website-771573.html "Welcome to The Independent's new website"].

The paper launched [[Podcast]] programmes such as The Independent Music Radio Show, The Independent Travel Guides, The Independent Sailing Podcasts, and The Independent Video Travel Guides. Since 2009, the website has carried short video news bulletins provided by the [[Al Jazeera English]] news channel.<ref name="Guard al Jazeera">{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jan/15/independent-al-jazeera-video-tie-up |title=Independent in al-Jazeera video tie-up |last=Fitzsimmons |first=Caitlin |date=15 January 2009 |work=guardian.co.uk (web only) |accessdate=1 May 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2014, The Independent launched a sister website ''i100'',<ref>http://i100.independent.co.uk/</ref> a "shareable" journalism site with similarities to [[Reddit]] and [[Upworthy]].<ref>http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/-not-just-another-newspaper-website-why-the-independent-launched-i100/s2/a557405/</ref>

==Political views==
When the paper was established in 1986, the founders intended its political stance to reflect the centre of the British political spectrum and thought that it would take readers primarily from ''The Times'' and ''The Daily Telegraph''. It is has been seen as leaning to the left, making it more a competitor to ''[[The Guardian]]'', though like its rival, it also features conservative columnists. ''The Independent'' tends to take a [[classical liberal]], pro-market stance on economic issues.<ref name="Wilby"/>  In an editorial on 27 January 2013, the ''Independent on Sunday'' referred to itself as a "proudly liberal newspaper".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/editorial-a-liberal-gamble-too-far-8468336.html |title= Editorial: a liberal gamble too far |date= 27 January 2013 |work=The Independent |location =London}}</ref>

An [[Ipsos MORI]] poll estimated that in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]{{update after|2015|05|07|reason=update after next general election}}, 44% of regular readers voted Liberal Democrat, 32% voted Labour,<ref>Also here: http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2476&view=wide</ref>
and 14% voted Conservative.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voting by Newspaper Readership 1992-2010|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2476/Voting-by-Newspaper-Readership-19922010.aspx?view=wide|work=Ipsos MORI General Election aggregates|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=21 September 2011|author=Ipsos MORI|authorlink=Ipsos MORI|date=24 May 2010}}</ref> On the eve of the 2010 general election, ''The Independent'' supported the Liberal Democrats, arguing that "they are longstanding and convincing champions of civil liberties, sound economics, international co-operation on the great global challenges and, of course, fundamental electoral reform. These are all principles that this newspaper has long held dear. That is why we argue that there is a strong case for progressively minded voters to lend their support to the Liberal Democrats wherever there is a clear opportunity for that party to win."<ref name=lead2010may5>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-this-historic-opportunity-must-not-be-missed-1962527.html |title= This historic opportunity must not be missed |date= 5 May 2010 |work=The Independent |location =London}}</ref> However the weekend before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] saw ''The Independent on Sunday'' claim it would not be advising its readers how to vote in 2015. The editorial piece claimed "this does not mean that we are a bloodless, value-free news-sheet. We have always been committed to social justice" but  the paper recognised it was up the readers to "make up your own mind about whether you agree with us or not". Rather than support a particular party, the paper urged all its reader to vote as "a responsibility of common citizenship".<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/general-election-2015-every-vote-matters--as-a-responsibility-of-citizenship-10221727.html</ref> However, on 4 May 2015, the weekday version of ''The Independent'' thought that a continuation of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]–Liberal Democrat coalition after the general election would be a positive outcome.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/in-defence-of-liberal-democracy-10224221.html "Editorial: In defence of liberal democracy"], ''The Independent'', 4 May 2015</ref>

A leader published on the day of the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London Mayoral election]], compared the candidates and said that, if the newspaper had a vote, it would vote first for the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] candidate, [[Sian Berry]], noting the similarity between her priorities and those of ''The Independent'', and secondly, with "rather heavy heart", for the then incumbent, [[Ken Livingstone]].<ref name="London endorsement">"So consonant are her priorities with those of this paper that, if we could vote for mayor today, we would place our first-preference cross against her name. This would underscore the importance of the environment to both London and to the rest of the nation. Then, and with rather heavy heart, it would be illogical to do anything other than make Ken Livingstone our second choice." {{cite news |title=If newspapers had a vote, this one would put its cross beside...

The paper took a strong editorial position against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], the [[Iraq War]], and aspects of US and UK foreign policy related to the [[War on Terrorism]] following the {{nowrap|[[11 September attacks]]}}. It has been a strong supporter of [[electoral reform]].<ref name=lead2010may5/> The paper has also taken strong positions on environmental issues, campaigned against the introduction of [[British national identity card|ID cards]], and campaigned against the restriction of mass immigration to the UK. In 1997, ''The Independent on Sunday'' launched a campaign for the decriminalisation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Ten years later, it reversed itself, stating that the cannabis strain ''skunk'' "smoked by the majority of young Britons" in 2007 had become "25 times stronger than [[hashish|resin]] sold a decade ago."<ref name="Indy cannabis">{{cite news |last1=Owen |first1=Jonathan |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/cannabis-an-apology-440730.html |title=Were we out of our minds?

In 2007, [[Alan Rusbridger]], editor of ''The Guardian'', said of ''The Independent'': "The emphasis on views, not news, means that the reporting is rather thin, and it loses impact on the front page the more you do that."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/what-happened-when-the-guardian-editor-met-piers-morgan-442870.html |title= What happened when the Guardian editor met Piers Morgan |work=The Independent |author=Morgan, Piers |location =London |date= 2 April 2007}}</ref> In a 12 June 2007 speech British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] called ''The Independent'' a "viewspaper", saying it "was started as an antidote to the idea of journalism as views not news. That was why it was called the Independent.
