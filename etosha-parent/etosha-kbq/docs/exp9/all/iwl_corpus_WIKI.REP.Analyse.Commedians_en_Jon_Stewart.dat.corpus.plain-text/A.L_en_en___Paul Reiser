He is most widely known for his role in the 1990s TV sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]''.

==Early life==

==Career==
After developing his skills as a stand-up comedian, Reiser had a breakout film role in 1982 when he appeared in ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]'', a [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] film directed by [[Barry Levinson]]. Reiser's character, Modell, a closet stand-up comedian, effectively brought Reiser's abilities to the attention of [[Hollywood]]. He followed this success by playing a detective in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984), a role he reprised in its sequel, ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]'' (1987). Reiser also had roles in [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), in which he played the corrupt Carter Burke; ''[[The Marrying Man]]'' (1991) and ''[[Bye Bye Love (film)|Bye Bye Love]]'' (1995).

Reiser starred as one of two possible fathers of a teenage girl in the TV sitcom ''[[My Two Dads]]'' (1987&ndash;90), and later came to prominence in North America as Paul Buchman in ''[[Mad About You]]'' (1992&ndash;99), a comedy series he co-created, in which [[Helen Hunt]] co-starred as his on-screen wife. He was also the co-composer of the show's theme song, "The Final Frontier" (with [[Don Was]]), and performed the piano for the theme's recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=22952 |title=Final Frontier by Andrew Gold Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref> Reiser's role in ''Mad About You'' earned him nominations for an [[Emmy]], a [[Golden Globe]], an [[American Comedy Award]] and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]. For the show's final season, Reiser and Hunt received $1&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1999|r=1}}}} million today) per episode.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7D81338F937A15750C0A96E958260 |title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; NBC Signs Deal to Keep 'Mad About You' for Another Season |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=March 24, 1998 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>

In 2001, Reiser played a dramatic role as a man desperate to locate his biological mother, after learning he has a serious illness, in the British TV film ''[[My Beautiful Son]]''. In 2002, Reiser made a guest appearance as himself on [[Larry David]]'s [[HBO]] sitcom, ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0551424/|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 3, Episode 5 : The Terrorist Attack|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref> In the TV comedy film ''Atlanta'' (2007), Reiser appears as one half of a couple who, after meeting at a funeral, are unable to stay away from each other.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/zap-prinzeatlantapilotcasting,0,4209768.story | work=Chicagotribune.com | title=Prinze Braves ''Atlanta'' for CBS|accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref> In 2010, Reiser collaborated with the singer [[Julia Fordham]] to create a CD album titled ''Unusual Suspects'', which includes the song "UnSung Hero", dedicated to American soldiers serving in [[Afghanistan]]. The two embarked on an acoustic tour after its release.<ref>{{cite web|last=Friedman |first=Roger |url=http://showbiz411.com/2010/09/20/paul-reiser-musician-tv-comic-joins-famed-singer-in-song-for-soldiers |title=Paul Reiser, Musician: TV Comic Joins Famed Singer in Song for Soldiers |publisher=Showbiz411.com |date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>

Reiser scripted and starred in the semi-autobiographical comedy series ''[[The Paul Reiser Show]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] as a [[mid-season replacement]] during the 2010–11 TV season.<ref name=schedule>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/05/16/nbc-unveils-2010-2011-primetime-schedule/20100516nbc01/|title=NBC Unveils 2010–11 Primetime Schedule Accented by Five New Comedies, Seven New Dramas and New Alternative Program |date=May 16, 2010 |work=The Futon Critic |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> "This is nice", commented Reiser on the [[Stephanie Miller]] radio program, "because you get to sit around and root for other shows to fail." However, due to the lack of [[lead time]] and [[Promo (media)|promotion]] by NBC prior to its debut (as well as [[Broadcast programming|poor scheduling]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/paul-reiser-jay-leno-tonight-show-yman-112521/ |title=Paul Reiser Speaks Out About NBC on ‘The Tonight Show’ |publisher=Screenrant.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-27/entertainment/ct-live-0428-amy-landecker-20110427_1_reiser-amy-landecker-john-records-landecker |title=Amy Landecker moves on after Paul Reiser Show |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref> the low-rated show was canceled on April 22, 2011, with only two episodes aired.<ref name=cancel>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/22/nbc-cancels-the-paul-reiser-show/90330|title=NBC Cancels ''The Paul Reiser'' Show|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=April 22, 2011|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Seidman |first=Robert |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/22/nbc-cancels-the-paul-reiser-show/90330 |title=''The Paul Reiser Show'' Cancelled After Two Episodes – Ratings &#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=April 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-paul-reiser-show-cancelled-19668/ |title=''Paul Reiser Show'' canceled |publisher=TV Series Finale |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>

Reiser has written three books: ''Couplehood'', about the ups and downs of being in a committed relationship; ''Babyhood'', about his experiences as a first-time father; and ''Familyhood'' (released in May 2011), a collection of humorous essays. ''Couplehood'' is unique in that it starts on page 145; Reiser explained this as his method of giving the reader a false sense of accomplishment. In 1996, Reiser appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in the middle of writing ''Babyhood''. Since he had not yet decided on a title, he presented a prop book, titled simply "Book" and with the same cover as that of ''Couplehood''.

==Personal life==
Reiser married Paula Ravets on August 21, 1988. They have two children: Ezra Samuel (born 1995) and Leon (born 2000). He is the uncle of screenwriter and producer [[Will Reiser]], who is known for writing the semi-autobiographical comedy-drama film ''[[50/50 (2011 film)|50/50]]'' (2011).

Reiser's first cousin is the legal scholar [[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]] of [[New York University]], the [[Cato Institute]], [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]], and the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricochet.com/main-feed/The-Chicken-or-The-Egg |title=The Chicken or The Egg? |publisher=Ricochet.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>
