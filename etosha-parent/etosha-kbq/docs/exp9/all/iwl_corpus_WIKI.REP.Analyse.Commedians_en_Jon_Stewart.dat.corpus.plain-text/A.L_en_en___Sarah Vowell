==Career==

===Published works===
Vowell is a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestselling author of six nonfiction books on American history and culture. Her most recent book is ''[[Unfamiliar Fishes]]'' (2011), which traces the growing influence of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|American missionaries]] in [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] in the 1800s and the subsequent takeover of Hawaii's property and politics by American sugar plantation owners, eventually resulting in a [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|coup d'état]], restricted voting rights for nonwhites, and [[Newlands Resolution|annexation]] by the United States. A particular focus is on 1898, when the U.S. "annexed Hawaii, [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]], and invaded [[Cuba]], and then the [[Philippines]], becoming a meddling, self-serving, militaristic international superpower practically overnight."<sup> [from the dust jacket]</sup> The title of the book is an allusion to a quotation from the aged [[David Malo]], who had been the first Native Hawaiian ordained to preach and Hawaii's first superintendent of schools:

<blockquote>If a big wave comes in, large and unfamiliar fishes will come from the dark ocean, and when they see the small fishes of the shallows they will eat them up. The white man's ships have arrived with clever men from the big countries. They know our people are few in number and our country is small, they will devour us.
:—''[[Unfamiliar Fishes]]'', pp. 138–139</blockquote>

Vowell's earlier book, ''[[The Wordy Shipmates]]'' (2008), examines the New England Puritans and their journey to and impact on America. She studies [[John Winthrop]]’s 1630 sermon "[[A Model of Christian Charity]]" – and the bloody story that resulted from American exceptionalism. And she also traces the relationship of Winthrop, Massachusetts' first governor, and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], the Calvinist minister who founded Rhode Island – an unlikely friendship that was emblematic of the polar extremes of the American foundation. Throughout, she reveals that American history can show up in the most unexpected places in modern American culture, often in unexpected ways.

Her book ''[[Assassination Vacation]]'' (2005) describes a road trip to tourist sites devoted to the murders of presidents Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. Vowell examines what these acts of political violence reveal about American national character and contemporary society.

She is also the author of two essay collections, ''[[The Partly Cloudy Patriot]]'' (2002) and ''[[Take the Cannoli]]'' (2000).  Her first book ''[[Radio On: A Listener's Diary]]'' (1997), is her year-long diary of listening to the radio in 1995.

Her writing has been published in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Gentlemen's Quarterly|GQ]]'', ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'', ''The New York Times'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the ''[[SF Weekly]]'', and she has been a regular contributor to the online magazine ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/writer/sarah_vowell/ Sarah Vowell – Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She was one of the original contributors to ''[[McSweeney's]]'', also participating in many of the quarterly's readings and shows.

In 2005, Vowell served as a guest columnist for ''The New York Times'' during several weeks in July, briefly filling in for [[Maureen Dowd]]. Vowell also served as a guest columnist in February 2006, and again in April 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/contributors/sarahvowell/index.html | work=The New York Times | title=Sarah Vowell}}</ref>

In 2008, Vowell contributed an essay about [[Montana]] to the book ''[[State by State: A Panoramic Portrait of America]]''. Vowell is set to publish her next book, “Lafayette in the Somewhat United States” in October, 2015.

Vowell also provided commentary in Robert Wuhl's 2005 ''Assume the Position'' HBO specials.

===Voice and acting work===
Vowell's first book, which had radio as its central subject, caught the attention of ''[[This American Life]]'' host [[Ira Glass]], and it led to Vowell's becoming a frequent contributor to the show. Many of Vowell's essays have had their genesis as segments on the show.

In 2004, Vowell provided the voice of [[Violet Parr]], the shy teenager in the [[Pixar]] animated film ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and reprised her role for the various related video games<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102970/ Sarah Vowell – IMDb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and Disney on Ice presentations featuring ''The Incredibles''. The makers of ''The Incredibles'' discovered Vowell from episode [http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/81/guns 81 – ''Guns''] of ''This American Life'', where she and her father fire a homemade cannon. Pixar made a test animation for Violet using audio from that sequence, which is included on the DVD version of ''The Incredibles''.  She also wrote and was featured in ''Vowellet: An Essay by Sarah Vowell'' included on the DVD version of ''The Incredibles'', where she reflects on the differences between being super hero Violet and being an author of history books on the subject of assassinated presidents, and what it means to her nephew Owen. Vowell also played Fernanda, Theacher ''Aunt'' Deborah and Mary Kelly in ''The School Future''.

Vowell provided commentary in "Murder at the Fair: The Assassination of President McKinley", which is part of the History Channel miniseries, ''[[10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America]].''

She is featured prominently in the [[They Might Be Giants]] documentary ''[[Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)|Gigantic]]''. She also participated on the DVD commentary for the movie, along with the film's director and They Might Be Giants' [[John Linnell]] and [[John Flansburgh]].

In September 2006, Vowell appeared as a minor character in the ABC drama ''[[Six Degrees]]''.  She appeared on an episode of HBO's ''[[Bored to Death]]'', as an interviewer in a bar.  In 2010, Vowell appeared briefly in the film ''[[Please Give]]'', as a shopper.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

On November 17, 2011, Vowell joined ''The Daily Show'' as the new Senior Historical Context Correspondent.

==Personal life==
Vowell is part [[Cherokee]] (about 1/8 on her mother's side and 1/16 on her father's side). According to Vowell, "Being at least a little Cherokee in northeastern Oklahoma is about as rare and remarkable as being a [[Michael Jordan]] fan in Chicago."  She retraced the path of the forced removal of the Cherokee from the southeastern United States to Oklahoma known as the [[Trail of Tears]] with her twin sister Amy. In 1998, ''[[This American Life]]'' chronicled her story, devoting the entire hour to her work.<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/107/trail-of-tears 107: Trail of Tears], [[This American Life]], July 3, 1998</ref>

Vowell is on the advisory board of [[826NYC]], a nonprofit tutoring and writing center for students aged 6–18 in [[Brooklyn]].
