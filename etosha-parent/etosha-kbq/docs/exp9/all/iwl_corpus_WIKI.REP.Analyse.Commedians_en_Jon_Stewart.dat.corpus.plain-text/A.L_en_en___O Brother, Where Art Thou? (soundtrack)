'''''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''''' is the [[soundtrack album]] of music from the 2000 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[film]] [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?|of the same name]], written, directed and produced by the [[Coen Brothers]] and starring [[George Clooney]], [[John Turturro]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], and [[John Goodman]].

With the film set in [[Mississippi]] during the [[Great Depression]], the soundtrack, produced by [[T-Bone Burnett]], uses [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], and [[American folk music|folk music]] appropriate to the time period. With the exception of a few vintage tracks (such as [[Harry McClintock]]'s 1928 single "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]]"), most tracks are modern recordings.

The soundtrack was reissued on August 23, 2011, with 14 new tracks that were not included in the original album, "including 12 previously unreleased cuts from music producer T-Bone Burnett's ''O Brother'' sessions."<ref>Germain, David.

==Development and sound==
The soundtrack was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or support. For this reason it was decided to record a soundtrack before filming.<ref name = "NashvilleScene">{{cite web | url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-22-00/nash_film-lede.html | title=Talking with Joel and Ethan Coen about 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' | publisher=Nashville Scene | date=May 22, 2000 | accessdate=February 14, 2012 | author=Ridley, Jim}}</ref> T-Bone Burnett was invited to design collections of music.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845962.stm | title=O Brother, why art thou so popular? | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=February 28, 2002 | accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref> One member of [[The Stanley Brothers]], [[Ralph Stanley]], personally took part in recording the music for ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'', singing a cappella folk song [[O Death]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/jun/18/artsfeatures.coenbrothers | title=American high | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 18, 2001 | accessdate=February 16, 2012 | author=Ellison, Michael}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2008/09/post_89.html?nav=rss_blog | title=Bluegrass Legend Ralph Stanley Endorses Obama | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date=September 9, 2008 | accessdate=February 16, 2012 | author=Kumer, Anita}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://drralphstanley.com/news/20040909.html | title=Museum Honoring Music Legend Ralph Stanley Set to Open October 16 | publisher=Ralph Stanley Museum | year=2004 | accessdate=February 16, 2012}}</ref>

There is a notable use of [[dirges]] and other macabre songs, a theme often recurring in Appalachian music,<ref>{{cite web| last=McClatchy|first=Debbie|title=A Short History of Appalachian Traditional Music|work=Appalachian Traditional Music – A Short History|date=2000-06-27|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/appalach.htm|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> such as in "[[O Death]]," "[[The Reverend Mr. Black|Lonesome Valley]]," "[[Angel Band (song)|Angel Band]]," and "I Am Weary", in contrast to the bright, cheerful songs, like "Keep On the Sunnyside" and "In the Highways", in other parts of the film.

"[[Man of Constant Sorrow|I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow]]" has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the [[music video]], and two in the soundtrack. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse.<ref name="OBWAT">{{cite web | last=Long | first=Roger J. | title="O Brother, Where Art Thou?" entry page | url=http://home1.gte.net/longrj2/fluff/o_brother.html | date=2006-04-09 | accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by [[Dan Tyminski]] (lead vocal on "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"), Nashville songwriter [[Harley Allen]], and the [[Nashville Bluegrass Band]]'s Pat Enright.<ref name="Soggy">{{cite web | url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233045 | title=Soggy Bottom Boys Hit the Top at 35th CMA Awards | accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>
