Norris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chuck Norris Fights to Be a Better Actor in 'Hero and the Terror' Role |work= The Los Angeles Times| date=September 2, 1988 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-02/news/li-2090_1_chuck-norris|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

He joined the [[United States Air Force]] as an [[United States Air Force Security Forces|Air Policeman]] (AP) in 1958 and was sent to [[Osan Air Base]], [[South Korea]]. It was there that Norris acquired the nickname ''Chuck'' and began his training in [[Tang Soo Do]] (tangsudo), an interest that led to [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] in that art and the founding of the [[Chun Kuk Do]] ("Universal Way") form.<ref>{{cite news|title= Body Watch; Kicking Old Habits; Chuck Norris found he couldn't eat just anything after he hit his mid-30s.

==Martial arts career==

[[Image:Chuck Norris, The Delta Force 1986.jpg|thumb|Norris on the set of the film ''[[The Delta Force]]'' (1986)]]
Norris was defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to [[Joe Lewis (martial arts)|Joe Lewis]] and [[Allen Steen]] and three matches at the [[Gosoku Ryu#Background|International Karate Championships]] to Tony Tulleners. By 1967 Norris had improved enough that he scored victories over the likes of Lewis, [[Skipper Mullins]], Arnold Urquidez, [[Vic Moore|Victor Moore]], Ron Marchini, and Steve Sanders.  Norris would be a two time winner at [[S. Henry Cho]]'s All American Championship.<ref>http://www.henrycho.com/sparring.html</ref> In early 1968, Norris suffered the tenth and last loss of his career, losing an upset decision to Louis Delgado. On November 24, 1968, he avenged his defeat to Delgado and by doing so won the Professional Middleweight Karate champion title, which he held for six consecutive years.<ref name="CNSSP"/> In 1969, he won Karate's triple crown for the most tournament wins of the year, and the Fighter of the Year award by ''[[Black Belt Magazine]]''.

Norris made history in 1990 when he was the first Westerner in the documented history of [[Taekwondo|Tae Kwon Do]] to be given the rank of 8th Degree Black Belt Grand Master.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56560|title=Questions I am asked most about martial arts|date=July 9, 2007}}</ref> In 1999, Norris was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum's Hall of Fame. On July 1, 2000, Norris was presented the Golden Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[World Karate Union]] Hall of Fame.

==Acting career==

===Rise to fame===

In 1969, Norris made his acting debut in the Dean Martin film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''. In June 1970, his younger brother Wieland, a private in the [[101st Airborne Division]], was killed in Vietnam while on patrol in the defense of [[Battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord|Firebase Ripcord]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thewall-usa.com/info.asp?recid=38095
|title=PFC Wieland Clyde Norris
|work=The Virtual Wall}}</ref> Norris later dedicated his ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'' films to his brother's memory.

At a martial arts demonstration in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], Norris met the martial artist [[Bruce Lee]]. In 1972, he acted as Lee's nemesis in the movie ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (titled ''Return of the Dragon'' in its U.S. distribution), which is widely credited with launching him toward stardom. In Asia, Norris is still known primarily for this role. In 1974, McQueen encouraged him to begin acting classes at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]].

Norris' first starring role was 1977's ''[[Breaker! Breaker!]]'', and subsequent films such as ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'' (1978), ''[[The Octagon (film)|The Octagon]]'' (1980), ''[[An Eye for an Eye (1981 film)|An Eye for an Eye]]'' (1981), and ''[[Lone Wolf McQuade]]'' proved his increasing box office bankability. In 1984, Norris starred in ''Missing in Action'', the first of a series of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II|Rambo]]''-inspired [[POW]] rescue fantasies themed around the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]] that were produced by Israeli cousins [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] and released under their [[Cannon Films]] banner. The film, however, was criticized heavily as being a preemptive cash-in on the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' film series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theflickcast.com/2011/05/16/war-movie-mondays-missing-in-action/|publisher=The Flick Cast|title=War Movie Mondays, ''Missing in Action'' Movie Review|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdose.com/box-office-flashback-december-10-1984/|publisher=Pop Dose: Pop Culture News, Reviews and Discussion|title=Box Office Flashback, December 10, 1984|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>

Over the next four years, Norris became Cannon's most prominent star, appearing in eight films, including ''[[Code of Silence (film)|Code of Silence]]'', ''[[The Delta Force (film)|The Delta Force]]'', and ''[[Firewalker (film)|Firewalker]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Academy Award]] winner [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]. Many of the aforementioned films were produced by Chuck Norris's brother Aaron, as were several episodes of ''Walker, Texas Ranger''. In 1986, he was involved in the production of the [[Ruby-Spears Productions|Ruby Spears]] cartoon ''[[Karate Kommandos]]''.

In October 2014 he revealed that he would be shooting a new film, ''The Finisher'', in March 2015.<ref>http://masternorris.com/filmography/the-finisher-2015</ref>

===''Walker, Texas Ranger''===
<!-- Deleted image removed:  -->
By the end of the 1980s, Cannon Films had faded from prominence, and Norris's star appeal seemed to go with it. He reprised his ''Delta Force'' role for MGM, which had acquired the Cannon library after the latter's [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. Norris went on to make several more films before making a transition to television.<ref>{{cite news|title= Chuck Norris: Karate Champ Turned Action-film Actor Turned Series Star? |work=The Los Angeles Times|date=April 18, 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-18/news/tv-24102_1_chuck-norris|accessdate=August 30, 2010 | first=Susan | last=King}}</ref> In 1993, he began shooting the series ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', which lasted eight years on [[CBS]] and continued in heavy syndication on other channels, notably the [[Hallmark Channel]].
[[File:Chuck Norris.jpg|thumb|right|Norris receiving the Veteran of the Year award by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] in 2001]]
On October 17, 2005, CBS premiered the Sunday Night Movie of the Week, ''Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire''. The production was a continuation of the series, and not scripted to be a reunion movie. Norris reprised his role as Cordell Walker for the movie. He has stated that future ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' Movie of the Week projects are expected; however, this was severely impaired by CBS's 2006–2007 season decision to no longer regularly schedule Movies of the Week on Sunday night.

==Product endorsements==
Norris has appeared with [[Christie Brinkley]] in a long-running series of cable TV [[infomercial]]s promoting [[Total Gym]] home [[fitness equipment]].

In 2010, Norris appeared in advertisements for communications company [[T-Mobile]] in the [[Czech Republic]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Chuck Norris shills for T-Mobile ads|work=The Prague Post|url= http://www.praguepost.com/business/6410-chuck-norris-shills-for-t-mobile-ads.html|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref> In 2011, Norris appeared in advertisements for the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' video game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arKpdxjHamI|title=World of Warcraft TV Commercial: Chuck Norris – Hunter|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> In 2012, Norris appeared in a series of commercials for the [[Poland|Polish]] bank [[Bank Zachodni WBK|BZ WBK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbj.pl/article-57688-when-chuck-norris-endorses-banks-he-goes-polish.html?typ=ise|title=Polish bank BZ WBK commercials with Chuck Norris|date=January 20, 2012|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>

==Chun Kuk Do==
{{main|Chun Kuk Do}}
Norris created the martial art Chun Kuk Do, which is based primarily on [[Tang Soo Do]] and includes elements from every combat style he knows. Like many other martial arts, Chun Kuk Do includes a code of honor and rules to live by. These rules are from Chuck Norris's personal code. They are: <ref>http://www.ufaf.org/founder_page.htm</ref>
# I will develop myself to the maximum of my potential in all ways.
# I will forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements.
# I will continually work at developing love, happiness and loyalty in my family.
# I will look for the good in all people and make them feel worthwhile.
# If I have nothing good to say about a person, I will say nothing.
# I will always be as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.
# I will maintain an attitude of open-mindedness.
# I will maintain respect for those in authority and demonstrate this respect at all times.
# I will always remain loyal to my God, my country, family and my friends.

Faces of Philanthropy, accessed December 20, 2010.</ref>

His time with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Veterans Administration]] as a spokesperson was inspired by his experience serving the [[United States Air Force]] in [[Korea]].

Due to his significant contributions, and continued patriotism, he received the ''Veteran of the Year'' award in 2001 at the ''American Veteran Awards''.<ref name="FOP"/>

Norris also established the [[United Fighting Arts Federation]] and [[KickStart]] in 1990. As a significant part of his philanthropic contributions, the organization was formed to develop self-esteem and focus in at-risk children as a tactic to keep them away from drug-related pressure by training them in martial arts. Norris hopes that by shifting middle school and high school children's focus towards this positive and strengthening endeavour, these children will have the opportunity to build a better future for themselves.<ref name="FOP"/><ref name="ikf">{{cite web|url=http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/48/36/|title=A Renaissance Man|publisher=Inside Kung Fu|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}</ref>
