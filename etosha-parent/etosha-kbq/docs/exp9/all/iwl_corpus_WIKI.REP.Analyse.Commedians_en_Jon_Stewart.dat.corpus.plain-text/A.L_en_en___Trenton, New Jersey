==History==

[[Image:TrentonBarracks.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Old Barracks in Trenton, New Jersey]]
The first settlement which would become Trenton was established by [[Quakers]] in 1679, in the region then called the Falls of the Delaware, led by [[Mahlon Stacy]] from [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]], [[Sheffield]], England. Quakers were being persecuted in England at this time and North America provided the perfect opportunity to exercise their religious freedom.

By 1719, the town adopted the name "Trent-towne", after [[William Trent (Trenton)|William Trent]], one of its leading landholders who purchased much of the surrounding land from Stacy's family. This name later was shortened to "Trenton".<ref>Krystal, Becky. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/trenton-nj-one-for-the-history-buffs/2011/02/10/AB6YArQ_story.html "Trenton, N.J.: One for the history buffs"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2012. "Back in the early 18th century, at least, the area was remote enough for Trent, a wealthy Philadelphia merchant, to build his summer home there near the banks of the Delaware River. And though it's dwarfed by its modern-day neighbors, at the time the home reflected its owner's 'ostentatious nature,' Nedoresow said. Further stroking his ego, he named the settlement he laid out 'Trent-towne,' which eventually evolved into the current moniker."</ref>

During the [[American Revolutionary War]],. the city was the site of the [[Battle of Trenton]], [[George Washington]]'s first military victory. On December 26, 1776, [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|Washington and his army, after crossing the icy Delaware River]] to Trenton, defeated the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian troops]] garrisoned there.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/washington-wins-first-major-us-victory-at-trenton This Day in History - Dec 26, 1776: Washington wins first major U.S. victory at Trenton], [[History (U.S. TV channel)]].

"City and state leaders kicked off a two-month celebration yesterday with a news conference highlighting Trenton’s brief role as the capital of the United States in 1784."</ref> The city was considered as a permanent capital for the new country, but the southern states favored a location south of the [[Mason-Dixon Line]].

Trenton became the state capital in 1790, but prior to that year the Legislature often met here.<ref>[http://www.nj.gov/nj/about/history/short_history.html A Short History of New Jersey], [[New Jersey]]. Accessed January 10, 2012.</ref> The town was incorporated in 1792.

During the [[War of 1812]], the primary hospital facility for the U.S. Army was at a temporary location on Broad Street.

Throughout the 19th Century, Trenton grew steadily, as Europeans came to work in its pottery and wire rope mills. In 1837, with the population now too large for government by council, a new mayoral government was adopted, with by-laws that remain in operation to this day.<ref>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=GiJRZVzkcskC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=Reconsidering+Trenton:+The+Small+City+in+the+Post-Industrial+Age&source=bl&ots=ES7cvnKtnW&sig=gSHQKq-Jhz0xyyRe6-qpkGxoyFo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ad05U_TfIIP9ygPi8YAI&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Reconsidering%20Trenton%3A%20The%20Small%20City%20in%20the%20Post-Industrial%20Age&f=false Richman, Steven M.

Trenton has long been part of the Philadelphia television market.  However, following the [[2000 United States Census]], Trenton was shifted from the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area to the New York metropolitan statistical area. With a similar shift by the [[New Haven, Connecticut]], area to the New York area, they were the first two cases where metropolitan statistical areas differed from their defined Nielsen television markets.<ref>[http://www.njsetc.net/news/Metropolitan%20Area%20Revisions%20Based%20on%20Census%202000%2012-14%201-00.ppt "New Statistical Area Information based on Census 2000"], [[New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development]], December 14, 2004.

Accessed December 7, 2011.</ref> Locals consider Trenton to be a part of ambiguous [[Central Jersey]], and thus part of neither region.  They are generally split as to whether they are within New York or Philadelphia's sphere of influence.  While it is geographically closer to Philadelphia, many people who have recently moved to the area commute to New York City, and have moved there to escape the New York region's high housing costs.

===Neighborhoods===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Battle of Trenton Monument.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The Battle of Trenton Monument in Trenton]] -->
The city of Trenton is home to numerous neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods. The main neighborhoods are taken from the four [[cardinal direction]]s (North, South, East, and West).  Trenton was once home to large Italian, Hungarian, and Jewish communities, but since the 1950s demographic shifts have changed the city into a relatively segregated urban enclave of middle and lower income African Americans. Italians are scattered throughout the city, but a distinct Italian community is centered in the [[Chambersburg, New Jersey|Chambersburg]] neighborhood, in South Trenton.<ref>Di Ionno, Mark. [http://blog.nj.com/njv_mark_diionno/2007/07/in_trenton_time_marches_on_and.html "Chambersburg"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', July 17, 2007. Accessed March 16, 2012. "The difference between Chambersburg, the traditional Italian section of Trenton, and other city neighborhoods that have undergone 'natural progression' is that Chambersburg hung on so long."</ref> This community has been in decline since the 1970s, largely due to economic and social shifts to the more prosperous, less crime-ridden suburbs surrounding the city.  Today Chambersburg has a large Latino community.  Many of the Latino immigrants are from Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua. There is also a significant and growing  Asian community in the Chambersburg neighborhood primarily made up of Burmese and Bhutanese/Nepali refugees.

The [[North Trenton|North Ward]], once a mecca for the city's middle class, is now one of the most economically distressed, torn apart by race riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. Nonetheless, the area still retains many important architectural and historic sites. North Trenton still has a large Polish-American neighborhood that borders Lawrence Township, many of whom attend St Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church on Brunswick Ave.  St. Hedwig's church was built in 1904 by Polish immigrants, many of whose families still attend the church. North Trenton is also home to the historic Shiloh Baptist Church—one of the largest houses of worship in Trenton and the oldest African American church in the city, founded in 1888. The church is currently pastored by Rev. Darrell L. Armstrong, who carried the Olympic torch in 2002 for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  Also located just at the southern tip of North Trenton is the city's Battle Monument, also known as "Five Points". It is a {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} structure that marks the spot where [[George Washington]]'s [[Continental Army]] launched the [[Battle of Trenton]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It faces downtown Trenton and is a symbol of the city's historic past.

[[South Trenton|South Ward]] is the most diverse neighborhood in Trenton and is home to many [[Latin America]]n, Italian-American, and African American residents.

[[East Trenton|East Ward]] is the smallest neighborhood in Trenton and is home to the [[Trenton Rail Station (New Jersey)|Trenton Train Station]] as well as [[Trenton Central High School]]. Recently, two campuses have been added, [[Trenton Central High School West]] and [[Trenton Central High School North]], respectively, in those areas of the city.  The Chambersburg neighborhood is within the East Ward, and was once noted in the region as a destination for its many [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants and pizzerias.  With changing demographics, many of these businesses have either closed or relocated to suburban locations.

West Ward is the home of Trenton's more suburban neighborhoods.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Trenton lies in the transition from a [[humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') to a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''), with four seasons of approximately equal length and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] fairly evenly distributed through the year. Winters are cold and damp: the daily average temperature in January is {{convert|31.1|°F|1}}, and temperatures at or below {{convert|10|°F|0}} occur on 3.9 nights annually, while there are 16−17 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing. Summers are hot and humid, with a July daily average of {{convert|75.7|°F|1}}; temperatures reaching or exceeding {{convert|90|°F|0}} occur on 15−16 days. Extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|−14|°F|0}} on February 9, 1934, up to {{convert|106|°F|0}} as recently as July 22, 2011.<ref>Staff. [http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20110722/NEWS/307229969 "Heat sets new record high in Trenton at 106 degrees"], ''[[The Trentonian]]'', July 22, 2011. Accessed February 12, 2014. "The thermometer reached a record-setting 106 degrees here in the City of Trenton, easily smashing July 22nd's previous high mark from 1926, when the temp reached 101 degrees."</ref> However, temperatures reaching {{convert|0|°F|0}} or {{convert|100|°F|0}} are uncommon.

The average precipitation is {{convert|46.4|in|sigfig=3}} per year, which is fairly evenly distributed through the year. The driest month on average is February, with {{convert|2.31|in|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation on average, while the wettest month is July, with {{convert|4.95|in|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall on average. The all-time single-day rainfall record is {{convert|7.25|in|1|abbr=on}} on September 16, 1999, during the passage of [[Hurricane Floyd]]. The all-time monthly rainfall record is {{convert|14.55|in|1|abbr=on}} in August 1955, due to the passage of [[Hurricane Connie]] and [[Hurricane Diane]]. The wettest year on record was 1996, when {{convert|67.90|in|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation fell. On the flip side, the driest month on record was October 1963, when only {{convert|0.05|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain was recorded. The {{convert|28.79|in|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation recorded in 1957 were the lowest ever for the city.<ref>[http://www.trentonnj.org/documents/fire%20department/city%20of%20trenton%20hazard%20mitigation%20plan_062808_f!!.pdf "City of Trenton, New Jersey Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan"], City of Trenton. Accessed February 12, 2014.</ref>

Snowfall can vary even more year-to-year. The average snowfall is {{convert|23.4|in|cm|1}}, but has ranged from as low as {{convert|2|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} in the winter of 1918–19 to as high as {{convert|76.9|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} in 1995–96, which included the greatest single-storm snowfall, the [[North American blizzard of 1996|Blizzard of January 7–8, 1996]], when {{convert|24.2|in|cm|1}} of snow fell.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Image:Trenton Makes.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Lower Trenton Bridge]] is commonly referred to among locals as the "Trenton Makes Bridge".]]
Trenton was a major manufacturing center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One relic of that era is the slogan "Trenton Makes, The World Takes", which is displayed on the [[Lower Free Bridge (Trenton)|Lower Free Bridge]] (just north of the [[Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge]]).<ref>Bruder, Jessica. [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/nyregion/jerseyana-trenton-s-fighting-words.html "JERSEYANA; Trenton's Fighting Words"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 2, 2004. Accessed March 16, 2012. "''Trenton Makes, the World Takes,'' reads the famous red neon sign that spans a bridge between the state Capitol and Morrisville, Pa., affectionately known by locals as the ''Trenton Makes'' bridge.... In its heyday, Trenton was a world-class producer of rubber, steel, wire rope, and pottery. The cables for three famous suspension bridges - the Brooklyn, George Washington and Golden Gate - were produced here at John A. Roebling's factory."</ref> The city adopted the slogan in 1917 to represent Trenton's then-leading role as a major manufacturing center for rubber, wire rope, ceramics and cigars.<ref>Blackwell, Jon. [http://www.capitalcentury.com/1911.html "1911: 'Trenton Makes' history"], ''[[The Trentonian]]''. Accessed October 28, 2014.</ref>

Along with many other United States cities in the 1970s, Trenton fell on hard times when manufacturing and industrial jobs declined. Concurrently, state government agencies began leasing office space in the surrounding suburbs. State government leaders (particularly governors [[William Cahill]] and [[Brendan Byrne]]) attempted to revitalize the downtown area by making it the center of state government. Between 1982 and 1992, more than a dozen office buildings were constructed primarily by the state to house state offices.<ref>Mickle, Paul. [http://www.capitalcentury.com/1984.html "1984: A whole new skyline"], ''[[The Trentonian]]''. Accessed October 28, 2014.</ref> Today, Trenton's biggest employer is still the state of New Jersey.

"Another large goal is to lure private companies whose employees, officials say, are likely to work later in the evening and have more money to spend than the 20,000 or so state workers who swell downtown during business hours, then commute home to other municipalities."</ref>

Portions of Trenton are part of an [[Urban Enterprise Zone]].

"The state Attorney General's Office filed a request Monday with a state Superior Court judge, asking that Tony Mack be kicked out of office, stripped of his pension and be barred from holding elected office again.... Under state law, people convicted of corruption cannot continue to hold public office.

His chief of staff was arrested trying to buy heroin. His half-brother, whose authority he elevated at the city water plant, was arrested on charges of stealing.

===Riots of 1968===
The Trenton Riots of 1968 were a major civil disturbance that took place during the week following the assassination of civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] on April 4. [[Race riot]]s broke out nationwide following the murder of the civil rights activist. More than 200 Trenton businesses, mostly in Downtown, were ransacked and burned. More than 300 people, most of them young black men, were arrested on charges ranging from assault and arson to looting and violating the mayor's emergency curfew. In addition to 16 injured policemen, 15 firefighters were treated at city hospitals for smoke inhalation, burns, sprains and cuts suffered while fighting raging blazes or for injuries inflicted by rioters.  Denizens of Trenton's urban core often pulled false alarms and would then throw bricks at firefighters responding to the alarm boxes.  This experience, along with similar experiences in other major cities, effectively ended the use of open-cab fire engines.  As an interim measure, the Trenton Fire Department fabricated temporary cab enclosures from steel deck plating until new equipment could be obtained. The losses incurred by downtown businesses were initially estimated by the city to be $7 million, but the total of insurance claims and settlements came to $2.5 million.<ref>Cumbler, John T. [http://books.google.com/books?id=G1kVVDSqCT8C&pg=PA283 ''A Social History of Economic Decline: Business, Politics and Work in Trenton''], p. 283. [[Rutgers University Press]], 1989.

Trenton's [[Trenton Battle Monument|Battle Monument]] neighborhood was hardest hit. Since the 1950s, North Trenton had witnessed a steady exodus of middle-class residents, and the riots spelled the end for North Trenton. By the 1970s, the region had become one of the most blighted and crime-ridden in the city, although [[gentrification]] in the area is revitalizing certain sections.

Because of Trenton's relative distance to New York City and Philadelphia, and because most homes in Mercer County receive network broadcasts from both cities, locals are sharply divided in fan loyalty between both cities. It is not uncommon to find Philadelphia's Phillies, Eagles, 76ers, Union and Flyers fans cheering (and arguing) right alongside fans of New York's Yankees, Mets, Nets, Knicks, Rangers, Jets, Red Bulls and Giants or the New Jersey Devils.

Between 1948 and 1979 [[Trenton Speedway]] hosted world class auto racing.  It was actually located in adjacent Hamilton Township. Drivers such as [[Jim Clark]], [[A. J. Foyt]], [[Mario Andretti]], [[Al Unser]], [[Bobby Unser]], [[Richard Petty]] and [[Bobby Allison]] raced on the one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) asphalt oval and then re-configured 1½ mile race track. The speedway, which closed in 1980, was part of the larger [[New Jersey State Fairgrounds]] complex, which also closed in 1983. The former site of the speedway and fairgrounds is now the [[Grounds for Sculpture]].<ref>[http://www.groundsforsculpture.org/fairhist.htm History of State Fairgrounds], [[Grounds for Sculpture]]. Accessed March 16, 2012. As horses were replaced by automobiles for transportation, cars became the main attraction on the fairground's racetrack. 'Lucky' Teter and his Hell Drivers made the headlines in the 1930s; in the sixties it was midget car races and a 200-mile race for Indianapolis cars and drivers."</ref>
