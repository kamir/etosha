[[File:The Guardian 2.svg|thumb|Newspapers are an example of mass media]]
'''Mass media''' are [[media]] like [[radio]], [[television]], [[internet]] or other things that reach many people.  Television is most used.  We can see and hear  [[news]] from around the world.  Radio also brings [[music]] and news.  [[Book]]s supply older and more detailed material.  The [[internet]] is also important.  We can search for all the news and [[information]].  [[Website]]s like [[Wikipedia]] and [[about.com]] give information about many things.  [[Library|Libraries]] are also important.  In libraries we can read [[book]]s and listen to music.

The term was coined in the 1920s with the advent of nationwide radio networks, mass-circulation [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, although mass media (like [[book]]s and [[manuscript]]s) were present centuries before the term became common.
