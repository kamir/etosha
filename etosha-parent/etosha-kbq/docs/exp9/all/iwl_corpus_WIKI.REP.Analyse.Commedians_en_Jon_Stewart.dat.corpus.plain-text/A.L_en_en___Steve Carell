===Film career===
[[File:SteveCarell07AA.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Carell at the Academy Awards in 2007]]
Carell's first major film role was as weatherman Brick Tamland in the 2004 hit comedy ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]''.

His work in the films ''Anchorman'', ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', and ''Bewitched'' established Carell as a member of Hollywood's so-called "[[Frat Pack]]", a group of actors who often appear in films together, that also includes [[Ben Stiller]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Luke Wilson]].
