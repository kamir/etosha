==Views and opinions==

===Issue positions===
May is an International Patron of the [[Henry Jackson Society]].<ref name=n/> In October 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' named May number 94 in its list of the '100 most influential conservatives in America'. The paper labeled him "an outspoken proponent of the need to achieve victory in Iraq and the broader war against Muslim extremism". It also described him as a "nimble" [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] activist in the American media.<ref name=tele/>

May supports the use of '[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]', other than [[waterboarding]], against those captured by the United States in what he calls the [[War on Terror]] so long as they are used as a "last resort". He views them as fundamentally different from '[[torture]]'. He also opposes regarding those captured as either [[Defendant|criminal defendants]] or [[prisoners of war]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[National Review Online]]|title=Shock Therapy|date=April 23, 2009|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzU1ZmI0ZDhkZmJmZWMwYmMyNWFjY2RjNDhiNWU3MWQ=&w=MA==|first=Clifford D. |last=May|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> On April 23, 2009, May appeared on [[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]] discussing the subject of torture, and he and Stewart engaged in a rather heated yet cordial debate on the subject. Jacob Gershman of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' later highlighted the exchange as one of the clearest discussions about the issue in the news media.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Neoconservative Pundits Love Jon Stewart|accessdate=August 12, 2009|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/08/why_conservative_pundits_love.html|first=Jacob|publisher=''[[New York Magazine]]''|last=Gershman}}</ref>

May supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] as well as the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|2007 "surge" strategy in the country]]. In March 2008, he wrote for [[National Review Online]], "[w]hat one can not say is that regime change in Iraq was unjustified: Not if you know Saddam’s record, his clearly stated intentions, and his ties to international terrorists—including, as a new Pentagon report reveals, a group headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, now al Qaeda’s second-in-command."<ref>{{cite news|date=March 23, 2008|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/20/opinion/main3954228.shtml|title=The Long War|accessdate=July 21, 2009|publisher=[[National Review Online]]|first=Clifford D. |last=May}}</ref> In an April 2004 interview with [[Tavis Smiley]], who alleged that Bush had decided to invade Iraq before the [[9/11 attacks]] and manipulated [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|intelligence on weapons of mass destruction]], May argued that Bush had been continuing the policy of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton-era]] ''[[Iraq Liberation Act]]'' and that Bush had pushed the [[CIA]] for accurate information.<ref name=tavis/>

He also told [[Tavis Smiley|Smiley]], "I'm rooting for the guy in the White House, personally, 'cause I do think he has done a good job".<ref name=tavis/> In the aftermath of the American re-deployment in Iraq during July 2009, he wrote for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', "[t]he news is not that American combat troops withdrew from Iraqi cities. The news is that American combat troops withdrew from Iraqi cities in victory—rather than in defeat."<ref name=hnn>{{cite news|title=Clifford D. May: Iraq ... An American victory |publisher=''[[History News Network]]''|url=http://www.hnn.us/roundup/comments/100948.html|accessdate=July 21, 2009|date= July 11, 2009|first=Clifford D. |last=May}}</ref>

May wrote for the ''San Angelo Standard Times'' in October 2012 that, despite the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] and other successes against al-Qaida, he considered the group "degraded" but not actually "defeated". He referred to the attempted assassination of [[Malala Yousufzai]] as a particular sign of a still dangerous Taliban. He argued,
{{quote|Roosevelt and Churchill grasped what too many analysts in government, academia, media and think tanks do not: To prevail against America's 21st century enemies, kinetic warfare is necessary but insufficient. An ideological war, a war of ideas, also must be waged. And on that front, we have not yet begun to fight.<ref>http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2012/oct/21/clifford-may-al-qaidas-ideology-has-not-been/</ref>}}

===Disputes and debates===
During the beginning of the [[CIA leak scandal]], May wrote in September 2003 that an ex-administration official had told him that [[Valerie Plame]] was a [[CIA]] agent, and May stated that the fact was an [[open secret]] widely known across Washington, D.C. He also remarked that he chose not to mention this in his own writings since he considered this to be irrelevant to anything else.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/may/may200309291022.asp|title=Spy Games|accessdate=August 12, 2009 |publisher=[[National Review Online]]|first=Clifford D. |last=May|date=September 29, 2003}}</ref> [[David Corn]], writing for ''[[The Nation]]'' in March 2007 in the aftermath of the [[CIA leak scandal|scandal]], disputed May's assertions, and he quoted [[Valerie Plame|Plame]] as saying that only a handful of people knew about her [[covert]] status. [[David Corn|Corn]] then called upon May, along with other conservative commentators such as [[Jonah Goldberg]] who had made similar statements, to apologize.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames/176110|author=[[David Corn]]|publisher=''[[The Nation]]''|date=March 16, 2007|title=Valerie Plame Speaks—Finally—About CIA Leak Case|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref>

On the October 15, 2007 edition of [[Tucker Carlson#MSNBC's Tucker|''Tucker'']] on [[MSNBC]], May agreed with host [[Tucker Carlson]]'s allegation that [[Hillary Clinton]] had used her [[gender]] to garner support in her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Presidential campaign]]. May then jokingly referred to Clinton as a '[[Vagina|Vaginal-American]]'. The comment was highlighted by [[Media Matters for America]].<ref>[http://mediamatters.org/research/200710160010 Cliff May on Sen. Clinton: "At least call her a Vaginal-American"]. [[Media Matters for America]]. Published October 16, 2007. Published July 21, 2009.</ref> In September 2007, [[Media Matters for America]] criticized May for making numerous public appearances in support of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] without mentioning his relationship with Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]]'s Advisory Committee on Democracy Promotion or the fact that the [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]] had received [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] monetary grants.<ref>[http://mediamatters.org/research/200709100007?f=i_latest Iraq war supporter Clifford May fails in media appearances to disclose State Dept. grants to organization he heads]. [[Media Matters for America]]. Published September 10, 2007. Retrieved July 21, 2009.</ref>

After [[Rush Limbaugh]] compared [[Barack Obama]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] in August 2009, ''[[Salon Magazine|Salon]]'' writer [[Glenn Greenwald]] stated on [[Glenn Greenwald#Salon.com|his blog]] that May had called [[Rush Limbaugh|Limbaugh's]] commentary "wrong, outrageous and damaging".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/08/06/republicans/index.html|title=GOP political tactics and media inanity in a nutshell|publisher=''[[Salon Magazine|Salon]]''|date=August 6, 2009|accessdate=August 11, 2009|author=[[Glenn Greenwald]]}}</ref> May wrote at [[National Review Online]] shortly afterward that [[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald]] had "[p]redictably" and "dishonorably" misrepresented the statement that he had e-mailed to [[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald]], which he said had criticized specious Nazi comparisons by both [[Rush Limbaugh|Limbaugh]], [[Moveon.org]], and [[Nancy Pelosi]].<ref>{{cite news|date=August 12, 2009 |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZGJhMTg5OTRjYjQxY2ExZjI1YWM2NzFkZDExODRlYWU=|title=Fascism 101|accessdate=August 12, 2009 |publisher=[[National Review Online]]|first=Clifford D. |last=May}}</ref>

On December 31, 2009, May jokingly suggested releasing detainees from [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] to [[Yemen]], then sending "missiles to strike the baggage-claim area".<ref>{{cite news|date=December 31, 2009 |url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDNhMWVmNGJjOGRiYjAwMDkwNjliYTI2MmYxMDZjM2Y=|title=A Bipartisan Proposal|accessdate=January 3, 2010 |publisher=[[National Review Online]]|first=Clifford D. |last=May}}</ref> He later defended the remarks, describing critics such as [[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald]] as "humorless". He also stated that he had intended to highlight the logical disconnect between someone both supporting the [[Extrajudicial killing|extrajudicial killing of suspected militants]] and opposing the holding of suspected militants  at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|date=January 1, 2009 |url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmFjNDc4NjBmM2I1MjJhZjUxNzA0Nzg4MmRhODI5YmQ=|title=Maybe We Should Outlaw Humor?|accessdate=January 3, 2010 |publisher=[[National Review Online]]|first=Clifford D. |last=May}}</ref>
