==History==
The 11:30 PM ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]) time-slot for Mondays through Thursdays on [[Comedy Central]] had previously been occupied by ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', another [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', which was hosted by [[Stephen Colbert]], and premiered on October 17, 2005. In 2012 Comedy Central renewed [[Jon Stewart|Jon Stewart's]] contract to host ''The Daily Show'' through the end of 2015 and Colbert's contract to host ''The Colbert Report'' through the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert Extend Contracts With Comedy Central|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-extend-contracts-comedy-central_n_1701801.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref> Colbert intentionally had his contract synced up with [[David Letterman|David Letterman's]] contract to host ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' for [[CBS]], so they would both expire at the same time;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Couch|first1=Aaron|title=Stephen Colbert will take over for David Letterman in 2015|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/colbert-report-sets-date-final-745322|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> in the event Letterman chose to retire, Colbert would be available to take over the show.<ref name=contracts>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|title=Colbert Will Host 'Late Show,' Playing Himself for a Change|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/business/media/stephen-colbert-to-succeed-letterman-on-late-show.html?_r=0|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref> On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced on his show that he will retire in 2015.<ref name=LettermanRetires>{{cite web|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=David Letterman to Retire From CBS in 2015|url=http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/david-letterman-to-retire-from-cbs-in-2015-1201152380/|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref> On April 10, 2014, it was announced that Colbert would leave Comedy Central at the end of 2014 and replace Letterman as the host of ''Late Show'' on CBS beginning in 2015.<ref name="LateShow">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/04/stephen-colbert-will-take-over-for-david-letterman/360481/ |title=Stephen Colbert Will Take Over for David Letterman |publisher=''[[The Wire]]'' |last=Zuckerman |first=Esther |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> The [[The final episode of The Colbert Report|final episode]] of ''The Colbert Report'' aired on December 18, 2014.

On May 9, 2014, it was announced that Wilmore had been selected to host a show to air in the 11:30 PM time-slot for Mondays through Thursdays on Comedy Central beginning in 2015.<ref name=ColbertSuccessor>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|title=A Successor to ‘Colbert’ Is Named|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/business/media/larry-wilmore-to-take-place-of-stephen-colbert-on-comedy-central.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name=BillCarter>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|title=Late Success for Latecomer to Late Night 'The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore' Premieres Jan. 19|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/arts/television/the-nightly-show-with-larry-wilmore-premieres-jan-19.html?_r=0|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Wilmore, like Colbert, had been a long-running cast member on ''The Daily Show'' prior to getting a spin-off.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Lacey|title=UPDATED: Larry Wilmore will host a new weeknight show, "The Minority Report With Larry Wilmore," set to premiere in January.|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comedy-central-picks-stephen-colbert-702908|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> He had worked as a [[List of The Daily Show correspondents|contributor]] on the show since August 2006; he served as the "Senior Black Correspondent" and also ran "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Wilmore-Oliver Investigates|Wilmore-Oliver Investigates]]" alongside [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]. The original title of the show was going to be ''The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore'', which was suggested by Jon Stewart. It was later changed as a result of receiving backlash from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] as they intend to use the same title for an upcoming series based on the [[Minority Report (film)|2002 film of the same name]], Wilmore later stated he was happy with the title change.<ref name="NewTitle">{{cite web|last1=Kenneally|first1=Tim|title=Larry Wilmore’s Comedy Central Show Gets New Title, Premiere Date|url=http://www.thewrap.com/larry-wilmores-comedy-central-show-gets-new-title-premiere-date/|publisher=[[TheWrap]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref>

==Production==
Jon Stewart pitched the idea to Comedy Central of giving Wilmore a show to air during the 11:30 PM time-slot after his show. According to the network president, Stewart said it would be the ideal time-slot for a show with a different format that would "provide an opportunity for the underrepresented voices out there".<ref name=ColbertSuccessor/> ''The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore'' is produced by Stewart's production company, [[Busboy Productions]]. Stewart, Wilmore, and former ''The Daily Show'' [[showrunner]] [[Rory Albanese]] serve as [[executive producers]].<ref name="Roy">{{cite web|last1=Kenneally|first1=Tim|title=Former ‘Daily Show’ Showrunner to Executive Produce Larry Wilmore’s Comedy Central Show|url=http://www.thewrap.com/former-daily-show-showrunner-to-executive-produce-larry-wilmores-comedy-central-show/|publisher=[[TheWrap]]|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref> Wilmore had been slated to be showrunner on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Black-ish]]'' (on which he is now billed as a consulting producer), but had to decline so he would be available to host ''The Nightly Show''.<ref name=ColbertSuccessor/>

The studio used to tape the show is the same one that was used for ''The Daily Show'' until July 2005<ref name="VF">{{cite journal|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/10/colbert200710|title=The Man in the Irony Mask|first=Seth|last=Mnookin|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=October 2007|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref> and for ''The Colbert Report'' throughout its entire run.<ref name="nightlyshow">{{cite news|date=November 20, 2014|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/11/20/larry-wilmore-nightly-show/19323019/|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Gary Levin|title=Comedy Central sets date for Colbert replacement

==Format==
The show's format has been described as a combination of ''The Daily Show'' and ''[[Politically Incorrect]]''. The show begins with a scripted take on the [[news]] by Wilmore, followed by a [[panel discussion]] led by Wilmore, in which he discusses a particular predetermined topic with his guests. The roster changes with each show, but thus far has featured comedians, journalists, politicians, and authors. Sometimes the opening news segment is omitted in favor of a longer panel discussion.<ref name=FormatEW>{{cite web|last1=Hibberd|first1=James|title=Larry Wilmore explains new show format, talks title change|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2015/01/10/larry-wilmore/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> In most episodes the main discussion is followed by a game with the panel (hosted by Larry) relating to the topic discussed. Monday episodes feature Jon Stewart talking to Wilmore at the end of ''The Daily Show'' leading into ''The Nightly Show'', a practice also used during the early years of ''The Colbert Report''.

On the format, Wilmore said "I’m not interested in doing a show where I give my opinion and people react to my opinion. Our show is more about the discovery of things. I want people who will teach me something." He also predicted that some people might change their minds on certain issues after hearing the different arguments in depth.<ref name=FormatVariety>{{cite web|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Larry Wilmore: ‘Nightly Show’ Will Blend ‘Daily Show,’ ‘Politically Incorrect’ Formats|url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/larry-wilmore-nightly-show-will-blend-daily-show-politically-incorrect-formats-1201399889/|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref>

==="Keep it 100"===
A common game played following the main discussion is "Keep it 100", a segment in which Wilmore challenges each guest to answer a controversial question completely honestly on the spot. Guests whom Wilmore and the audience believe to be answering honestly receive "I Kept It 100" stickers, while those whom the audience suspects of being less than honest are presented with a bag of "[[Tea bag|weak tea]]", displaying the show's logo. Occasionally Wilmore asks the audience to submit their own "Keep it 100" questions to him via [[social media]], one of which is selected by staff of the show and presented to Wilmore in the following episode; who does not get to see the question in advance before answering on the spot during the taping.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Tim Goodman wrote that the show's premiere was: "predictably strong [...] the slight nitpicking should not obscure the fact that overall Wilmore was funny; his show was smart and thoughtful, has a bright future and seems an excellent fit with Stewart and the Comedy Central brand."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/nightly-show-larry-wilmore-first-764863|title='The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore': First Impressions|author=Tim Goodman|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref>
