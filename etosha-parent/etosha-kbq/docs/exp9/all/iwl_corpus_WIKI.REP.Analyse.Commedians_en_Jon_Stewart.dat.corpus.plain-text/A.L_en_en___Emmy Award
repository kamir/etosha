An '''Emmy Award''', or simply '''Emmy''', recognizes excellence in the [[television]] industry, and corresponds to the [[Academy Award]] (for [[film]]), the [[Tony Award]] (for [[theatre]]), and the [[Grammy Award]] (for [[music]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/2007/09/070917_emmy.shtml |title=BBC Learning English &#124; Emmy awards |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/tv/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=6148800 |title=Emmys For Dame Helen/The Sopranos - Reality TV &#124; Photos &#124; News &#124; Galleries |publisher=Entertainment.uk.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>

Because Emmy Awards are given in various sectors of the [[Television in the United States|American television]] industry, they are presented in different annual ceremonies held  throughout the year. The two events that receive the most media coverage are the [[Primetime Emmys]] and the [[Daytime Emmys]], which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable Emmy Award ceremonies are those honoring [[Sports Emmy Award|national sports programming]], [[News & Documentary Emmy Award|national news and documentary shows]], national business and financial reporting, and [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award|technological and engineering achievements]] in television. [[#Regional Emmys|Regional Emmy Awards]] are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local and statewide television. In addition, [[#International Emmys|International Emmys]] are awarded for excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States.

Three related but separate organizations present the Emmy Awards: the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS), the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (NATAS), and the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (IATAS).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/index.php | publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | title=Awards | accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref> Each is responsible for administering a particular set of Emmy ceremonies.<ref name="emmyHistory"/>

==History==
[[File:Bruce Kennedy.jpg|thumb|right|TV producer [[:Bruce Kennedy (television producer)|Bruce Kennedy]] holding an Emmy]]

The [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS) established the Emmy Award as part of an image-building and [[public relations]] opportunity.<ref name="emmyHistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/atemmys/history.php | title=History of the Television Academy | publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref>  The [[1st Primetime Emmy Awards|first Emmy Awards ceremony]] were presented on January 25, 1949, at the [[Hollywood Athletic Club]], but solely to honor shows produced and aired locally in the [[Los Angeles]] area. [[Shirley Dinsdale]] has the distinction of receiving the very first Emmy, for Most Outstanding Television Personality, during that first awards ceremony.<ref name="emmyHistory"/>

In the 1950s, the ATAS expanded the Emmys into a national event, presenting the awards to shows broadcast nationwide. In 1955, the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (NATAS) was formed in [[New York]] as a sister organization to serve members on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], and help to also supervise the Emmys. The NATAS also established regional chapters throughout the [[United States]], with each one developing their own local Emmy awards show for local programming.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> The ATAS still however maintained its separate regional ceremony honoring local programming in the Los Angeles Area.<ref name="ATAS Los Angeles"/>

Originally there was only one Emmy Awards ceremony held per year to honor shows nationally broadcast in the United States. In 1974, the first [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] ceremony was held to specifically honor achievement in national daytime programming. Other area-specific Emmy Awards ceremonies soon followed. Also, the International Emmy Awards, honoring television programs produced and initially aired outside the U.S., was established in the early 1970s.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> Meanwhile, all Emmys awarded prior to the emergence of these separate, area-specific ceremonies are listed along with the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] in the ATAS' official records.<ref name="emmyRecords">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search | title=Advanced Primetime Awards Search
 | publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref>

In 1977, due to various conflicts, the ATAS and the NATAS agreed to split ties. However, they also agreed to share ownership of the Emmy statue and trademark, with each responsible for administering a specific set of award ceremonies.<ref name="emmyHistory"/>

==Emmy statuette==

The Emmy statuette, depicting a winged woman holding an atom, was designed by television engineer [[Louis McManus]], who used his wife as the model. The TV Academy rejected a total of forty-seven proposals before settling on McManus' design in 1948. The statuette "has since become the symbol of the TV Academy's goal of supporting and uplifting the art and science of television: The wings represent the muse of art; the atom the electron of science."<ref name="emmyOrigin">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/academy/about/statuette | title=History of the Emmy Statuette |first=Sandra |last=Parker | publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences | accessdate=2014-10-01}}</ref>

When deciding a name for the award, Academy founder [[Syd Cassyd]] originally suggested "Ike", the nickname for the television [[iconoscope]] tube. However, "Ike" was also the popular nickname of [[World War II]] hero and future [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and therefore Academy members wanted something more unique. Finally, television engineer and the third academy president, Harry Lubcke, suggested the name "Immy", a term commonly used for the [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|image orthicon tube]] used in the early cameras.<ref name="emmyOrigin"/> After "Immy" was chosen, it was later feminized to Emmy to match their female statuette.<ref name="emmyOrigin"/>

Each Primetime Emmy statuette weighs six pounds, twelve-and-a-half ounces (3.08&nbsp;kg), and is made of copper, nickel, silver and gold. The statue stands {{convert|15.5|in|cm}} tall with a base diameter of {{convert|7.5|in|cm}} and weight of 88 oz (2.5&nbsp;kg). The Regional Emmy Award statuette is 11.5&nbsp;inches (29&nbsp;cm) tall with a base diameter of 5.5&nbsp;inches (14&nbsp;cm) and weight of 48 oz (1.4&nbsp;kg). Each takes five-and-one-half hours to make and is handled with white gloves to prevent fingerprints. The Regional Emmy Awards are made by [[Society Awards]], a New York based company that also makes the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. The Primetime Emmy statues are manufactured by [[R.S. Owens & Company]] based out of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] which is also charged with manufacturing the Academy Award statues.<ref name="History of the Emmy Statue">{{cite web|last=Award|first=Emmy|title=History of the Emmy Statue|url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/history-emmy-statuette|work=NATAS History|publisher=NATAS|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="R.S.

As its trademark owners, the ATAS and the NATAS hold firm rules on the use of the "Emmy" image as well as its name. For example, the Emmy statuette must always appear facing left. Any copyright notice for the statue should read "ATAS/NATAS", listing both academies. Academy members must also obtain permission to use the statue image or name for promotional uses even though they are winners of the award. Furthermore, DVDs of Emmy-winning shows may reference the fact that they received an Emmy, but cannot use the statue image unless it is capable of being removed from all copies after one year after the award is presented.<ref name="ATAS Trademark and Copyright">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/copyrighttrademark | title=ATAS Copyright and Trademark Policies | publisher=ATAS |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="NATAS Trademark and Copyright">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/copyright.html | title=NATAS Copyright and Trademark Policies | publisher=NATAS |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Area-specific ceremonies==
[[File:Dana Delany 1992 Emmys retouch.jpg|right|thumb|Actress [[Dana Delany]] holding an Emmy, 1992]]
[[File:Bradley Bell 2010 Daytime Emmy Awards.jpg|right|thumb|TV producer and writer [[Bradley Bell]] accepting Daytime Emmy Awards for his work on the daytime soap opera ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', 2010]]
The Emmys are presented in various area-specific ceremonies held annually throughout the calendar year, ranging from honoring nationally televised shows to regionally and locally produced programs. Each ceremony has their own set of nominating and voting procedures, along with different rules regarding voting committees. Also, the various ceremonies each have own set of award categories, and it is not uncommon for them to have some of the same names (e.g. [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|''Primetime'' Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|''Daytime'' Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series]]).

A show that enters into one of the national Emmy competitions cannot also be entered into any of the others. For example, [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated shows]] whose air times vary between media markets may be eligible for both the Daytime and Primetime Emmys, but cannot enter in both.<ref name="PrimetimeEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/pte11_rulesandproced_rev6.pdf | title=63rd Primetime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-03-03 | quote=Syndicated programs that have reached a cumulative audience of at least 50% of the total potential U.S. television audience during the eligibility period, but not 50% exclusively in Daytime or Primetime, may enter either in Daytime or Primetime, but not in both}}</ref> In general, a show is considered national if it reaches more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that do not reach at least 50 percent of the country may enter into the Regional Emmys instead.

Regardless of which area-specific ceremony one wins an Emmy, all winners are called an "Emmy Winner".

===Primetime Emmys===
{{main|Primetime Emmy Award|List of Primetime Emmy Awards ceremonies}}

The [[Primetime Emmy Award|Primetime Emmys]] are presented in recognition of excellence in American [[primetime]] television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in mid-September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season, and are currently broadcast in rotation among the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] networks.

Some award categories presented to behind-the-scenes personnel such as [[art director]]s, [[costume designer]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[casting director]]s, and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]]s are awarded at a separate [[Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmys]] ceremony held a few days earlier.

The Primetime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the ATAS. For most categories, members from each of the ATAS' branches vote around June to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting to determine the winners is held in August.<ref name="PrimetimeEmmyRules2">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/pte11_rulesandproced_rev6.pdf | title=63rd Primetime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref>

Additionally, the ATAS also presents several Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards to individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the technological and engineering aspects of television.<ref name="Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/primetime-emmys/2013/engineering-emmys | title=Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards}}</ref> Among them is the [[Philo T. Farnsworth Corporate Achievement Award]], given to honor companies who have significantly affected the state of television and broadcast engineering over a long period of time. These are awarded at their own ceremony approximately a month after the other Primetime Emmys, and separate from the NATAS' [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]] repertoire.

===Daytime Emmys===
{{details|Daytime Emmy Award}}

The [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, generally are held in June, are presented in recognition of excellence in American [[daytime television]] programming. The first daytime-themed Emmy Awards were given out at the primetime ceremony in 1972, but the first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was not held until 1974.

Like the Primetime Emmys, a separate Creative Arts Emmy ceremony is also held a few days earlier to honor the behind-the-scenes personnel working in daytime television.

The Daytime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the NATAS. Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active member of the NATAS, who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years, is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system.<ref name="DaytimeEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.daytimeemmys.tv/ | title=39th Daytime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref> All the drama acting categories have an addition preliminary voting round called the "pre-nominations", where one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.<ref>{{cite web | title=2010 Daytime Emmy Pre-Nominations Announced | url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/2010_daytime_emmy_pre_nominations_announced/ | work=Soap Opera Digest | quote=Those are the names put forth by each show for consideration to be nominated for the awards. | accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

===Sports Emmys===
{{details|Sports Emmy Award}}

The Sports Emmy Awards are presented for excellence in [[Broadcasting of sports events|sports programming]]. The awards ceremony takes place every Spring, usually sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May, and is held on a Monday night in [[New York City]].

Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as judges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. [[CBS Corporation]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[NBCUniversal]], [[21st Century Fox]], [[Time Warner]] etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the "nominations", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.<ref name="SportsEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/sports/applications/33rd/sports_33rd_annual_rulebook.pdf | title=33rd Sports Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>

===News and Documentary Emmys===
{{details|News & Documentary Emmy Award}}

The [[News & Documentary Emmy Award]]s are presented for excellence in [[Television news in the United States|national news]] and documentary programming.  The awards ceremony takes place every Fall.

Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national news or documentary reporting or production to serve as judges. Most categories have two voting rounds, with separate judging panels in each round. The top entries in each category are announced as the "nominations", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.<ref name="NewsEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.tv/news/applications/33rdNewsEntryForms/33rd_nd_rulebook.pdf | title=33rd News & Documentary Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref>

===Technology and Engineering Emmys===
{{details|Technology & Engineering Emmy Award}}

The [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s are presented to individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the technological and engineering aspects of television. The award is determined by a special NATAS panel composed of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/tech/scope_and_procedures.html | title=Technology and Engineering Emmy Award: Scope and Procedures |  publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref>

===Regional Emmys===
There are 20 total regional chapters located across the United States that each conduct regional awards to recognize excellence in all the regional [[Media market|television markets]], including state to state programming as well as [[local news]] and [[Local programming|locally produced shows]]. Nineteen of the regional chapters are affiliated with the NATAS,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html | title=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: Chapters | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> while the Los Angeles-based ATAS acts as the regional chapter serving the Los Angeles area.<ref name="ATAS Los Angeles">{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/membership/nationalacademy.php | title=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: National Academy | quote=because our headquarters, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, are located in Los Angeles, our offices handle regional membership and awards for the Los Angeles area only | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/contact/faq.php | title=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: FAQ | quote=The Academy also encompasses a Los Angeles branch whose members work in Southern California | accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref>

In general, a show is considered regional if it does not reach more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that reach more than 50 percent of the country must enter into one of the national Emmy competitions instead.

The Regional Emmys are essential in helping NATAS and ATAS honor the works of deserving individuals in local TV through a regional outreach. Like the national awards, each region goes through their own rigorous nomination and voting procedures. Committees are formed to review entries for eligibility and high standards. Once accepted, each entry goes before different review committees, and their votes are cast to determine the final nominees. The final votes are then calculated by certified accounting firms within each region. Regardless of winning on a national or regional level, all recipients are ''"Emmy Award"'' winners.

Originally, each Regional Emmy Awards ceremony primarily focused on only honoring individuals in local ''news'' programming.<ref name="emmyHistory"/> The regionals have since been expanded to encompass all locally and state to state-produced shows that receive less than fifty percent of the country's viewing audience.

[[File:Fernanda Lima in 2012.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian actress and TV host [[Fernanda Lima]] holding [[Rede Globo]]'s six medals of nominations to the International Emmys in 2012]]
The International Emmy Awards are presented annually since 1973 by the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]], television programs that have been produced and transmitted outside the [[United States]]. The award ceremony takes place in [[New York City]].

By 1963, the [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] began to honor the programming produced outside the United States with the best international program award. Responsible for the International Relations Committee of the Academy, Ted Cott noted that the goal of the class was "to promote international understanding and draw attention of the American public to television programs produced and presented in different countries around the world."<ref name="thefreelibrary.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/20+years+of+the+International+Emmy+Awards.-a013370692 |publisher=thefreelibrary.com/ |author= |work= |title=20 years of the International Emmy Awards|date= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The winners in the first years include ''[[War and Peace (1972 TV series)|War and Peace]]'' ([[ITV Granada]]) in 1963, ''Les Raisins verts'' ([[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|RTF]]) in 1964, and ''Le Barbier de Seville'' from [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] in 1965. Initially no there were distinctions and only one prize was delivered. For the 1965 competition two categories were created, fiction and nonfiction, and a year later renamed entertainment and documentary. 

Then co-founder of the International Council of [[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|NATAS]], [[Ralph Baruch]] became international head of [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] in the 1960s to him at the time it was evident that the [[Big Three television networks|three major US networks]] were not much interested in programming foreign. In order to promote interest in such programming, Baruch thought would be good begin to "awarding" the best international programming.

Founded in 1969, the [[International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] is an organization of leading media and entertainment figures from over 50 countries and 500 companies from all sectors of television including internet, mobile and technology. The Academy was founded with a mission to recognize excellence in television programming produced outside of the [[United States]]. The first International Emmy Awards, as we know them today, were carried out in 1973, two years after the formation of the Council. The Baruch himself organized the first award ceremony, held at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]]. The event was attended by about 200 guests.<ref>{{cite news |title=The International Council: more than just Emmys|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=thefreelibrary.com/|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+International+Council%3A+more+than+just+Emmys.-a020204687|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref>
 
At the time there were only two categories, one for fiction, won that year for ''[[La cabina]]'', of [[Televisión Española]], and a non-fiction award, won that year by the [[BBC]] for ''Horizon: The Making of a História Natural Film''. The categories of fiction and non-fiction continued until 1979, when new awards were introduced and other categories were created. Replacing the previous two, now there were awards for best drama series, documentary, performing arts and popular arts programs. In 1983, the children's programming category was introduced to International Emmy Awards, given to ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' from [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19831123&id=QqQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=P-8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3924,1546819 |publisher=thefreelibrary.com/ |author= |work=Ottawa Citizen |title=Fraggle Rock Wins Emmy |trabalho= |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> In 1989, a sixth category was presented: Arts documentary, the winner that first year was ''Gwen-A Juliet Remembered'', produced by Saffron Productions for [[BBC]].<ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/><ref>{{cite news |title=UK productions dominate International Emmy nominations|last=|first= |date=17 October 2000 |work=|publisher=broadcastnow.com/|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/uk-productions-dominate-international-emmy-nominations/1203279.article|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref>

Until 2007, the International Emmy only rewarded art program, children's program, actor, actress, comedy, documentary, current affairs program, news, drama series, reality show and miniseries. In 2008 was created the category of best [[telenovela]], recognized by the institution as "a universal phenomenon."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2008/01/368161-emmy-internacional-premiara-telenovela.shtml |publisher=thefreelibrary.com/ |author= |work=[[Folha de São Paulo]] |title=Emmy Internacional premiara telenovela|date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> The International Academy also recognizes US primetime programming produced 50% or more in non-English languages, with a new category added to the [[42nd International Emmy Awards|2014 International Emmy Awards competition]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Spanglish Series Dominate Bilingual Category at Intl.

By regulation of the award, a television station or their representatives may never vote in the categories in which they are competing. The Academy does not participate in the trial. Who evaluates the registered programs are about 600 television professionals from 40 countries. The whole process is audited by [[Ernst & Young]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2008/09/441941-globo-refuta-acusacoes-da-record-sobre-emmy-internacional.shtml |author= |title=Globo refuta acusações da Record sobre Emmy Internacional |work=[[Folha de São Paulo]] |language= |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>
 
Currently, the awards are presented at the International Emmy Awards Gala.

The three Interactive categories are awarded in a separate ceremony held during [[MIPTV]] in [[Cannes]].

There are twenty one program categories for the [[International Emmy Award]]s:<ref>{{cite web|title=Awards – Nominees (International Emmy)|url=http://www.iemmys.tv/awards_nominees.aspx|publisher=|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}</ref>
