'''James Maitland "Jimmy" Stewart'''{{#tag:ref|Although commonly known as "Jimmy" by the media and public, Stewart always used "James".|group=N}} (May 20, 1908{{spaced ndash}}July 2, 1997) was an American film and stage actor, known for his distinctive drawl voice and down-to-earth persona. Over the course of his career, he starred in many films widely considered classics. He was known for portraying the American middle class man with everyday life struggles.

Stewart was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], winning one in competition and receiving one [[Academy Honorary Award|Lifetime Achievement]] award. Stewart was named the third greatest male screen legend in cinema history by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name="Stars">[http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx "AFI's 100 YEARS ... 100 STARS."] ''American Film Institute (Afi.com)'', June 16, 1999.

He also had a noted military career and was a [[World War II]] and [[Vietnam War]] [[veteran]], who rose to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|United States Air Force Reserve]].

The actor [[Cary Grant]] said of Stewart's acting technique:<blockquote>He had the ability to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people ''do'' often interrupt one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an ''enormous'' impact. And then, some years later, [[Marlon Brando|Marlon]] came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-07-06/entertainment/9707031555_1_jimmy-stewart-james-stewart-george-bailey|title=Jimmy Stewart: The Biggest Little Man|work=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref></blockquote>

==Early life and career==
[[File:James Stewart in After the Thin Man trailer.jpg|left|thumb|''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936)]]

James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], the son of Elizabeth Ruth Jackson (1875–1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (1871–1961), who owned a hardware store.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/James-Stewart.html "James Stewart profile."] ''FilmReference.com.''

His mother was an excellent pianist but his father discouraged Stewart's request for lessons. When his father accepted a gift of an accordion from a guest, young Stewart quickly learned to play the instrument, which became a fixture offstage during his acting career. As the family grew, music continued to be an important part of family life.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 15.</ref>

Stewart attended [[Mercersburg Academy]] prep school, graduating in 1928. He was active in a variety of activities. He played on the football and track teams, was art editor of the ''KARUX'' yearbook, and a member of the choir club, [[glee club]], and John Marshall Literary Society. During his first summer break, Stewart returned to his hometown to work as a brick loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs where he painted lines on the roads. Over the following two summers, he took a job as an assistant with a professional magician.<ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum">[http://www.jimmy.org/biography "Biography."] ''The Jimmy Stewart Museum''. Retrieved January 11, 2011.</ref> He made his first appearance onstage at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play ''The Wolves''.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 31.</ref>


A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after-school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. It was a dream greatly enhanced by the legendary 1927 flight of [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose progress 19-year-old Stewart, then stricken with scarlet fever, was himself avidly following from home; thus foreshadowing his starring movie role as Lindbergh 30 years later.<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A. Scott|title=Lindbergh|date=1999|publisher=Berkley/Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-425-17041-0|page=121}}</ref>

However, he abandoned visions of being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the [[United States Naval Academy]] he attend [[Princeton University]]. Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932. He excelled at studying [[architecture]], so impressing his professors with his thesis on an airport design that he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies;<ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum"/> but he gradually became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the [[Princeton Triangle Club]].<ref>[http://www.princeton.edu/~triangle/content_page/history.html "Princeton Triangle Club."] ''princeton.edu''. Retrieved January 11, 2011.</ref> His acting and accordion talents at Princeton led him to be invited to the [[University Players]], an intercollegiate summer stock company in [[West Falmouth, Massachusetts]], on [[Cape Cod]]. The company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with [[Joshua Logan]], [[Bretaigne Windust]] and Charles Leatherbee as directors. Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932, after he graduated.

The troupe had previously included [[Henry Fonda]], who married [[Margaret Sullavan]] on Christmas Day 1931, while the players were in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for an 18-week winter season.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 43.</ref> Sullavan, who had rejoined the Players in Baltimore in November 1931 at the close of the post-Broadway tour of ''A Modern Virgin'', left the Players for good at the end of ''[[The Trial of Mary Dugan]]'' in Baltimore in March 1932. By the time Stewart joined the University Players on Cape Cod after his graduation from Princeton in 1932, Fonda and Sullavan's brief marriage had ended.<ref>Houghton 1951, pp. 300–310.</ref> Stewart and Fonda became great friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an apartment with [[Joshua Logan]] and [[Myron McCormick]].<ref>Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 74.</ref> When Stewart came to New York at the end of the summer stock season, which had included the Broadway tryout of ''Goodbye Again'', he shared an apartment with Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan. Along with fellow University Players [[Alfred Dalrymple]] and [[Myron McCormick]], Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of ''[[Carry Nation (play)|Carry Nation]]'' and a few weeks later – again with McCormick and Dalrymple – as a chauffeur in the comedy ''Goodbye Again'', in which he had two lines. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' noted, "Mr. James Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause."<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 57.</ref>

[[File:Yellow_Jack_play_starring_James_Stewart,_drawing_from_Herald_Tribune.jpg|thumb|right|[[Al Hirschfeld]] drawing from [[Yellow Jack (Play)|Yellow Jack]] (Stewart, upper-left)]]The play was a moderate success, but times were hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the [[Great Depression|Depression]] was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934", Stewart later recalled, "I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded."<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 58.</ref> By 1934, he was given more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit ''Page Miss Glory'' and his first dramatic stage role in [[Sidney Howard]]'s ''[[Yellow Jack (Play)|Yellow Jack]]'', which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling. In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in ''[[The Farmer Takes a Wife]]'' took him to [[Hollywood]]. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of ''Divided by Three'', a glittering première with many luminaries in attendance, including [[Irving Berlin]], [[Moss Hart]] and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 65.</ref>

[[File:The Shopworn Angel trailer.JPG|thumb|left|Stewart made four features with [[Margaret Sullavan]], the second of which was ''[[The Shopworn Angel]]'' (1938)]]
Upon Stewart's arrival by train in Los Angeles, Fonda greeted him at the station and took him to Fonda's studio-supplied lodging, next door to [[Greta Garbo]]. Stewart's first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. Aside from an unbilled appearance in a [[Shemp Howard]] comedy [[short subject|short]] called ''[[Art Trouble]]'' in 1934, his first film was the poorly received [[Spencer Tracy]] vehicle, ''[[The Murder Man]]'' (1935). ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose Marie]]'' (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After having mixed success in films, he received his first intensely dramatic role in [[1936 in film|1936]]'s ''[[After the Thin Man]]'', and played [[Jean Harlow]]'s character's frustrated boyfriend in the [[Clark Gable]] vehicle ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' earlier that same year.

On the romantic front, he dated newly divorced [[Ginger Rogers]].<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 74.</ref> The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in Hollywood thanks largely to Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her [[leading man]] in the 1936 romantic comedy ''[[Next Time We Love]]''. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a week in the MGM factory.<ref>Eliot 2006, pp. 84, 87.</ref> In 1936, he acquired big-time agent [[Leland Hayward]], who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.

==Prewar success==

[[File:James Stewart in You Can't Take It with You.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Capra]]'s comedy ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]'' (1938) was one of the films that brought Stewart widespread attention]]
In 1938, Stewart had a brief, tumultuous romance with Hollywood queen [[Norma Shearer]], whose husband, [[Irving Thalberg]], head of production at MGM, had died two years earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director [[Frank Capra]] in [[1938 in film|1938]], when he was loaned out to [[Columbia Pictures]] to star in ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]''. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in ''[[Navy Blue and Gold (film)|Navy Blue and Gold]]'' (1937). The director had recently completed several popular movies, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Gary Cooper]] did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen."<ref name="Eliot p. 105">Eliot 2006, p. 105.</ref>

''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]'', starring Capra's "favorite actress", comedienne [[Jean Arthur]], won the [[1938 in film|1938]] [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The following year saw Stewart work with Capra and Arthur again in the political comedy-drama ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]''. Stewart replaced intended star [[Gary Cooper]] in the film, playing an idealist thrown into the political arena. Upon its October 1939 release, the film garnered critical praise and became a box-office success. Stewart was nominated for the first of five [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Stewart's father was still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life. Stewart took a secret trip to Europe to take a break and returned home in 1939 just as [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germany invaded Poland]].<ref name="Eliot p. 105"/>

''[[Destry Rides Again]]'', also released in 1939, became Stewart's first [[western movie|western film]], a genre with which he would become identified later in his career. In this western parody, he is a pacifist lawman and [[Marlene Dietrich]] is the dancing saloon girl who comes to love him, but doesn't get him. In the film, Dietrich sings her famous song "[[See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]". Off-screen, Dietrich did get her man, but the romance was short-lived.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 139.</ref> ''[[Made for Each Other (1939 film)|Made for Each Other]]'' (1939) had Stewart sharing the screen with irrepressible [[Carole Lombard]] in a melodrama that garnered good reviews for both stars, but did less well with the public. ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote that they were "perfectly cast in the leading roles."<ref>Jones, McClure and Twomey 1970, p. 67.</ref> Between movies, Stewart began a radio career and became a distinctive voice on the [[Lux Radio Theater]]'s ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' and other shows. So well-known had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 112.</ref>

[[File:James Stewart - Katharine Hepburn - Philadelphia Story.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''The Philadelphia Story'' (1940)]]
In 1940, Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films. The first, the [[Ernst Lubitsch]] romantic comedy, ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'', starred Stewart and Sullavan as co-workers unknowingly involved in a pen-pal romance but who cannot stand each other in real life (this was subsequently remade into the musical, ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Van Johnson]], and later as the romantic comedy ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' with [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Meg Ryan]]). It was Stewart's fifth film of the year and that rare film shot in sequence; it was completed in only 27 days.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 144.</ref> ''[[The Mortal Storm]]'', directed by [[Frank Borzage]], was one of the first blatantly anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] films to be produced in Hollywood and featured Sullavan and Stewart as friends and then lovers caught in turmoil upon [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s rise to power, literally hunted down by their own friends.

[[File:Philadelphia Story 13.jpg|right|thumb|Stewart won his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for 1940's ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]''. He is seen here with co-star [[Katharine Hepburn]]]]
Stewart also starred with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in [[George Cukor]]'s classic ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940). His performance as an intrusive, fast-talking reporter earned him his only [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] in a competitive category (Best Actor, 1941), and he beat out his good friend Henry Fonda (''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]''). Stewart thought his performance "entertaining and slick and smooth" but lacking the "guts" of "Mr. Smith."<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 167.</ref> Stewart gave the Oscar statuette to his father, who displayed it for many years in a case inside the front door of his hardware store, alongside other family awards and military medals.

During the months before he began military service, Stewart appeared in a series of [[screwball comedy|screwball comedies]] with varying levels of success. He followed the mediocre ''[[No Time for Comedy]]'' (1940) with [[Rosalind Russell]] and ''[[Come Live with Me (film)|Come Live with Me]]'' (1941) with [[Hedy Lamarr]] with the [[Judy Garland]] musical, ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'', and the [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]] romantic comedy ''[[Pot o' Gold (film)|Pot o' Gold]]'' featuring [[Paulette Goddard]]. Stewart was drafted in late 1940, a situation that coincided with the lapse in his [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] contract, marking a turning point in Stewart's career, with 28 movies to his credit at that point.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 168.</ref>

==Military service==
The Stewart and Jackson families had deep military roots as both grandfathers had fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and his father had served during both the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I]]. Stewart considered his father to be the biggest influence on his life, so it was not surprising that, when another war came, he too was eager to serve. Members of his family had previously been in the infantry, but Stewart chose to become a military flier.<ref>Smith 2005, pp. 25–26.</ref>

An early interest in flying led Stewart to gain his [[Private Pilot License|Private Pilot certificate]] in 1935 and [[Commercial Pilot Licence|Commercial Pilot certificate]] in 1938. He often flew cross-country to visit his parents in Pennsylvania, navigating by the railroad tracks.<ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum" /> Nearly two years before the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Stewart had accumulated over 400 hours of flying time.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1670 "Brigadier General James Stewart."] National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved November 2, 2011.</ref>

Considered a highly proficient pilot, he entered a cross-country race as a co-pilot in 1939.<ref>Smith 2005, p. 26.</ref> Stewart, along with musician/composer [[Hoagy Carmichael]], saw the need for trained war pilots, and joined with other Hollywood celebrities to invest in [[Thunderbird Field]], a pilot-training school built and operated by [[Southwest Airways]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. This airfield became part of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] training establishment and trained more than 10,000 pilots during World War II, and is now the home of [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110622085538/http://www.airfields-freeman.com/AZ/Airfields_AZ_Phoenix_NW.htm "Thunderbird Field."] airfields-freeman.com.

In October 1940, Stewart was drafted into the [[United States Army]] but was rejected for failing to meet height and weight requirements for new recruits—Stewart was five pounds (2.3&nbsp;kg) under the standard. To get up to 148 pounds, he sought out the help of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's muscle man and trainer Don Loomis, who was noted for his ability to add or subtract pounds in his studio gymnasium. Stewart subsequently attempted to enlist in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]], but still came in under the weight requirement, although he persuaded the enlistment officer to run new tests, this time passing the weigh-in,<ref name="Smith p. 30">Smith 2005, p. 30.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Stewart later confided that he had a 'friend' operating the weight scales.<ref name="Smith p. 30" />|group=N}} with the result that Stewart enlisted and was inducted in the Army on March 22, 1941.

Stewart enlisted as a private<ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum" /><ref name="jcs-group" /> but as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot applied for an Air Corps commission and [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|pilot rating]]. Soon to be 33, he was almost six years beyond the maximum age restriction for aviation cadet training, the normal path of commissioning for pilots. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 19, 1942, shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], while a corporal at [[Moffett Field]], California. He also received a pilot rating, although the circumstances are unclear, since he did not participate in the standard pilot training program.{{#tag:ref|Stewart, who had taken the required ground school courses as an enlisted man, likely was rated under the newly established [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge#Service Pilot|service pilot]] program for civilian pilots, although that program was restricted to noncombat flying. However with his unusual circumstances, and as one of the first to be so rated, he was awarded a standard pilot rating.<ref name="sm42" />|group=N}} Stewart's first assignment was an appearance at a [[March of Dimes]] rally in Washington, D.C., but Stewart desired assignment to an operational unit rather than serve as a recruiting symbol. He applied for and was granted advanced training in multi-engined aircraft. Stewart was posted to nearby [[Mather Field]] to instruct in both single- and twin-engined aircraft.<ref name="jcs-group">[http://www.jcs-group.com/military/allyair/stewart.html "Brigadier General James Stewart."] Something About Everything Military.

Public appearances by Stewart were limited engagements scheduled by the Army Air Forces. "Stewart appeared several times on network radio with [[Edgar Bergen]] and [[Charlie McCarthy]]. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, he performed with [[Orson Welles]], [[Edward G.

The USAAF's [[First Motion Picture Unit]] shot scenes of Lieutenant Stewart in his [[A-2 jacket|pilot's flight jacket]] and recorded his voice for narration. The short propaganda film, ''[[Winning Your Wings]]'', appeared nationwide beginning in late May and was very successful, resulting in 150,000 new recruits.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 181.</ref><ref>Biederman, Patricia Ward.

He was transferred to [[Hobbs Army Airfield]], New Mexico, for three months of transition training in the four-engine [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], then sent to the Combat Crew Processing Center in [[Salt Lake City]], where he expected to be assigned to a combat unit. Instead he was assigned in early 1943 to an operational training unit, the [[29th Flying Training Wing|29th Bombardment Group]] at [[Boise Airport#Gowen Field|Gowen Field]], [[Boise, Idaho]], as an instructor.<ref name="jcs-group" /> He was promoted to captain on July 9, 1943,<ref name="sm273" /> and appointed a squadron commander.<ref name="sm42" /> For Stewart, now 35, combat duty seemed far away and unreachable and he had no clear plans for the future.

In August 1943, Stewart was assigned to the 445th Bomb Group as operations officer of the [[703d Bombardment Squadron]], but after three weeks became its commander. On October 12, 1943, judged ready for overseas movement, the 445th Bomb Group staged to [[Lincoln Army Airfield]], Nebraska.

After several weeks of training missions, in which Stewart flew with most of his combat crews, the group flew its first combat mission on December 13, 1943, to bomb the [[U-boat]] facilities at [[Kiel]], [[Germany]], followed three days later by a mission to [[Bremen]]. Stewart led the high squadron of the group formation on the first mission, and the entire group on the second.<ref name="sm44">McGowan "From Private to Colonel", p. 44.</ref> Following a mission to [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, on January 7, 1944, Stewart was promoted to major.<ref name="sm44" />{{#tag:ref|While leading the 445th on this date, Stewart made a decision in combat to not break formation from another group that had made an error in navigation.

[[File:You Gotta Stay Happy poster.jpg|right|thumb|135px]]
''[[Magic Town]]'' (1947), a comedy film directed by [[William A. Wellman]], starring James Stewart and [[Jane Wyman]], was one of the first films about the then-new science of public opinion polling. It was poorly received. He completed ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) directed by Alfred Hitchcock and ''[[Call Northside 777]]'' (1948), and weathered two box-office disappointments with ''[[On Our Merry Way]]'' (1948), a comedic musical ensemble in which Stewart and [[Henry Fonda]] were paired as two jazz musicians named "Slim" and "Lank," and ''[[You Gotta Stay Happy]]'' (1949), for which the posters depicted Stewart being kissed on one cheek by [[Joan Fontaine]] and on the other by a [[chimpanzee]]. In the [[documentary film]] ''James Stewart: A Wonderful Life'' (1987), hosted by [[Johnny Carson]], Stewart said that he went back to [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] in 1950 in part because of a string of films that were flops.

He returned to the stage to star in [[Mary Coyle Chase]]'s ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', which had opened to nearly universal praise in November 1944,<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 214">Eliot 2006, p. 214.</ref> as Elwood P. Dowd, a wealthy eccentric living with his sister and niece, and whose best friend is an invisible rabbit as large as a man. Dowd's eccentricity, especially the friendship with the rabbit, is ruining the niece's hopes of finding a husband. While trying to have Dowd committed to a [[sanatorium]], his sister is committed herself while the play follows Dowd on an ordinary day in his not-so-ordinary life. Stewart took over the role from [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]] and gained an increased [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] following in the unconventional play.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 214"/> The play, which ran for nearly three years with Stewart as its star, was successfully adapted into a [[1950 in film|1950]] [[Harvey (film)|film]], directed by [[Henry Koster]], with Stewart as Dowd and [[Josephine Hull]] as his sister, Veta. [[Bing Crosby]] was the first choice but he declined.<ref>Eliot 2006, pp. 208, 213.</ref> Stewart reprised the role on the London stage in 1975.

Stewart received his fourth [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination for his performance in the film. After ''Harvey'', the comedic adventure film ''[[Malaya (film)|Malaya]]'' (1949) with [[Spencer Tracy]] and the conventional but highly successful biographical film ''[[The Stratton Story]]'' in [[1949 in film|1949]], Stewart's first pairing with "on-screen wife" [[June Allyson]], his career took another turn.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 237.</ref> During the 1950s, he expanded into the [[western movie|western]] and [[suspense]] genres, thanks to collaborations with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Anthony Mann]].

Other notable performances by Stewart during this time include the critically acclaimed [[1950 in film|1950]] [[Delmer Daves]] western ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', which featured Stewart as an ex-soldier and Indian agent making peace with the [[Apache]]; a troubled clown in the [[1952 in film|1952]] [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]''; and Stewart's role as Charles Lindbergh in [[Billy Wilder]]'s [[1957 in film|1957]] film ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St. Louis]]''. He also starred in the western radio show ''[[The Six Shooter]]'' for its one-season run from 1953 to 1954. During this time Stewart wore the same [[cowboy hat]] and rode the same horse, named "Pie", in most of his Westerns.<ref name="pie">[http://www.wildwestweb.net/pie.html "James Stewart's Horse."] ''Wild West net''.

==Collaborations with Hitchcock and Mann==
Stewart's collaborations with director [[Anthony Mann]] increased Stewart's popularity and sent his career into the realm of the [[western movie|western]]. Stewart's first appearance in a film directed by Mann came with the [[1950 in film|1950]] western, ''[[Winchester '73]]''. In choosing Mann (after first choice [[Fritz Lang]] declined), Stewart cemented a powerful partnership.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 248">Eliot 2006, p. 248.</ref> The film, which became a massive box-office hit upon its release, set the pattern for their future collaborations. In it, Stewart is a tough, revengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands, until the showdown between Stewart and his brother ([[Stephen McNally]]).<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 248" />

[[File:Nakedspur trailer 3.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart made eight films for director [[Anthony Mann]]. Five of them were [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], including ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953).]]

Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as ''[[Bend of the River]]'' ([[1952 in film|1952]]), ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' ([[1953 in film|1953]]), ''[[The Far Country]]'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]) and ''[[The Man from Laramie]]'' ([[1955 in film|1955]]), were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the [[American West]]. Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewart's screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 251.</ref>

Stewart and Mann also collaborated on other films outside the [[western movie|western]] genre. [[1954 in film|1954]]'s ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' was critically acclaimed, garnering Stewart a [[BAFTA Award]] nomination, and (together with ''The Spirit of St. Louis'') cemented the popularity of Stewart's portrayals of 'American heroes'. ''[[Thunder Bay (film)|Thunder Bay]]'', released the same year, transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a more contemporary setting, with Stewart as a [[Louisiana]] oil driller facing corruption. ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'', released in [[1955 in film|1955]], allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.

Stewart's starring role in ''Winchester '73'' was also a turning point in Hollywood. [[Universal Studios]], who wanted Stewart to appear in both that film and ''Harvey,'' balked at his $200,000 asking price. His agent, [[Lew Wasserman]], brokered an alternate deal, in which Stewart would appear in both films for no pay, in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 245">Eliot 2006, p. 245.</ref> Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for ''Winchester '73'' alone.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 245" /> Hollywood's other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying "[[studio system]]".<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 254.</ref>

The second collaboration to define Stewart's career in the 1950s was with acclaimed mystery and suspense director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewart's acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires. Stewart's first movie with Hitchcock was the technologically innovative [[1948 in film|1948]] film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', shot in long "real time" takes.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 220.</ref>

[[File:James Stewart in Rear Window trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) was one of four films Stewart made with [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Stewart became the highest-grossing star of 1954 as a result.]]

The two collaborated for the second of four times on the 1954 hit ''[[Rear Window]]'', widely considered one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Stewart portrays photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, loosely based on ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer [[Robert Capa]], who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg. Jeffries gets into more than he can handle, however, when he believes he has witnessed a salesman ([[Raymond Burr]]) commit a murder, and when his glamorous girlfriend ([[Grace Kelly]]), at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime, eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. It was a landmark year for Stewart, becoming the highest grossing actor of 1954 and the most popular Hollywood star in the world, displacing [[John Wayne]].<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 278.</ref> Hitchcock and Stewart formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film, which later became the subject of a [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Stewart v. Abend]]'' (1990).
[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace.jpg|thumb|With [[Kim Novak]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', 1958]]
After starring in Hitchcock's remake of the director's [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|earlier]] production, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), with [[Doris Day]], Stewart starred, with [[Kim Novak]], in what many consider Hitchcock's most personal film, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 310.</ref> The movie starred Stewart as John "Scottie" Ferguson, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing. Scottie's obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in. Though the film is widely considered a classic today, ''Vertigo'' met with very mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 321.</ref> The director reportedly blamed the film's failure on Stewart looking too old to be Kim Novak's love interest, and cast [[Cary Grant]] as Roger Thornhill in ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), a role Stewart had very much wanted. (Grant was actually four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger.) Today, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' is ranked highest in the 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics poll for the greatest films ever made, taking the title from veteran favorite ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref name="bbc">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19078948 "Vertigo is named 'greatest film of all time'."] BBC News, August 2, 2012.

===Career in the 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:James Stewart - 1959.jpg|thumb|''Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959)]]
In 1960, Stewart was awarded the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and received his fifth and final [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] nomination, for his role in the [[1959 in film|1959]] [[Otto Preminger]] film ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]''. The early [[courtroom drama]] stars Stewart as Paul Biegler, the lawyer of a hot-tempered soldier (played by [[Ben Gazzara]]) who claims [[temporary insanity]] after murdering a tavern owner who raped his wife. The film featured a career-making performance by [[George C. Scott]] as the prosecutor. The film was considered quite explicit for its time, and it was a box-office success.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 332.</ref> Stewart's nomination was one of seven for the film ([[Charlton Heston]] was the winner with ''Ben-Hur''), and saw his transition into the final decades of his career. It is ranked as one of the best [[trial film]]s of all time.<ref name="aba-list">Verone, Patric M. "The 12 Best Trial Movies." ''[[ABA Journal]]''. November 1989 reprinted in ''Nebraska Law Journal''.</ref>

On January 1, 1960, Stewart received news of the death of [[Margaret Sullavan]] (her death was later identified as apparent suicide; the county coroner, however, officially ruled the death an accident).<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 337.</ref> As a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, she had a unique influence on Stewart's life. On April 17, 1961, longtime friend [[Gary Cooper]] was too ill to attend the [[33rd Academy Awards]] ceremony, so Stewart accepted the honorary Oscar on his behalf. Stewart's emotional speech hinted that something was seriously wrong, and the next day newspapers ran the headline, "Gary Cooper has cancer." One month later, on May 13, 1961, six days after his 60th birthday, Cooper died.

In the early 1960s, Stewart took leading roles in three [[John Ford]] films, his first work with the acclaimed director. The first, ''[[Two Rode Together]]'', paired him with [[Richard Widmark]] in a Western with thematic echoes of Ford's ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. The next, [[1962 in film|1962]]'s ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'', Stewart's first picture with [[John Wayne]], is a classic "psychological" western, shot in [[black and white]] [[film noir]] style featuring powerful use of shadows in the climactic sequence, with Stewart as an Eastern attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (played by [[Lee Marvin]]) in a small frontier town. At story's end, Stewart's character — now a rising political figure — faces a difficult ethical choice as he attempts to reconcile his actions with his personal integrity. The film's billing is unusual in that Stewart was given [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] over Wayne in the trailers and on the posters but Wayne was listed above Stewart in the film itself. The complex picture garnered mixed reviews but was an instant hit at the box office and became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades.

[[File:Westwon trailer Stewart.png|thumb|<center>''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962)</center>]]
''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (which Ford co-directed, though without directing Stewart's scenes) and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' were western epics released in 1962 and [[1964 in film|1964]] respectively. One of only a handful of movies filmed in true [[Cinerama]], shot with three cameras and exhibited with three simultaneous projectors in theatres, ''How the West Was Won'' went on to win three [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and reap massive box-office figures. ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'', in which a white-suited Stewart played [[Wyatt Earp]] in a long semi-comedic sequence in the middle of the movie, failed domestically and was quickly forgotten. The historical drama was Ford's final Western and Stewart's last feature film with Ford. Stewart's entertainingly memorable middle sequence is not directly connected with the rest of the film and was often excised from the lengthy film in later theatrical exhibition prints and some television broadcasts.

Having played his last romantic lead in ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'' (1958), and silver-haired (although not all was his—he wore a partial hairpiece starting with ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and in every film thereafter), Stewart transitioned into more family-related films in the 1960s when he signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. These included the successful [[Henry Koster]] outing ''[[Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), and the less memorable films ''[[Take Her, She's Mine]]'' ([[1963 in film|1963]]) and ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]), which featured French model [[Brigitte Bardot]] as the object of Stewart's son's mash notes. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] period film ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' (1965) and the [[western movie|western]] family film ''[[The Rare Breed]]'' fared better at the box office; the Civil War movie, with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, was a smash hit in the South.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:James stewart hawkins 1973.JPG|left|upright|thumb|In 1973 TV series ''[[Hawkins (TV series)|Hawkins]]''.]]

As an aviator, Stewart was particularly interested in aviation films and had pushed to appear in several in the 1950s, including ''[[No Highway in the Sky]]'' (1951), and most notably ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Spirit of St. Louis (film)|The Spirit of St. Louis]] (1957). '' He continued in this vein in the 1960s, most notably in a role as a hard-bitten pilot in ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'' (1965). Subbing for Stewart, famed stunt pilot and air racer [[Paul Mantz]] was killed when he crashed the "[[Tallmantz Phoenix P-1]]", the specially made, single-engined movie airplane, in an abortive "touch-and-go". Stewart also narrated the film ''[[X-15 (film)|X-15]]'' in 1961.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055627/fullcredits "X-15 (film) Full credits."] ''IMDb.''

''Airport Journals'', June 2003.</ref>

After a progression of lesser western films in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stewart transitioned from cinema to television. In the 1950s he had made guest appearances on the ''[[Jack Benny]] Program''. Stewart first starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] comedy ''[[The Jimmy Stewart Show]]'', on which he played a college professor, and was the only time in his career in which he was formally billed in the credits as "Jimmy" instead of "James". He followed it with the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] ''[[Hawkins (TV series)|Hawkins]]'', in which he played a small town lawyer investigating cases, similar to his character in ''Anatomy of a Murder.'' The series garnered Stewart a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor in a Dramatic TV Series, but failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with ''[[Shaft (TV series)|Shaft]]'', another high-quality series but with a starkly conflicting demographic, and was cancelled after one season. During this time, Stewart periodically appeared on [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, ''Jimmy Stewart and His Poems'' (1989).<ref>Krier, Beth Ann. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-10/news/vw-2722_1_jimmy-stewart "The muse within Jimmy Stewart."] ''Los Angeles Times'', September 10, 1989.</ref>

Stewart returned to films after an absence of five years with a major supporting role in [[John Wayne]]'s final film, ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976) where Stewart played a doctor giving Wayne's gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis. At one point, both Wayne and Stewart were flubbing their lines repeatedly and Stewart turned to director [[Don Siegel]] and said, "You'd better get two better actors." Stewart also appeared in supporting roles in ''[[Airport '77]]'', the 1978 [[remake]] of ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' starring [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Raymond Chandler]]'s [[Philip Marlowe]], and ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'' (1978). All three movies received poor reviews, and ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'' flopped at the box office.

Following the failure of ''[[The Magic of Lassie]]'', Stewart went into semi-retirement from acting. He donated his papers, films, and other records to [[Brigham Young University]]'s [[Harold B. Lee Library]] in 1983.<ref name="giles20080522">Giles, Aly. [http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/68645 "Memories of Stewart Live at Y."] ''The Daily Universe'', May 22, 2008.</ref> Stewart had diversified investments including real estate, oil wells, a charter-plane company and membership on major corporate boards, and he became a multimillionaire. In the 1980s/90s, he did voiceover work for commercials for [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soups]].

Stewart's longtime friend [[Henry Fonda]] died in 1982, and former co-star and friend [[Grace Kelly]] was killed in a car crash shortly afterwards. A few months later, Stewart starred with [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[Right of Way (film)|Right of Way]]''. He filmed several [[television movie]]s in the 1980s, including ''[[Mr. Krueger's Christmas]]'', which allowed him to fulfill a lifelong dream to conduct the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]].<ref>"Utah-Hollywood connection runs deep." ''[[Deseret News]]'', January 26, 2009, p. B2.</ref> He made frequent visits to the Reagan White House and traveled on the lecture circuit. The re-release of his Hitchcock films gained Stewart renewed recognition. ''[[Rear Window]]'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' were particularly praised by film critics, which helped bring these pictures to the attention of younger movie-goers. He was presented an [[Academy Honorary Award]] by [[Cary Grant]] in 1985, "for his 50 years of memorable performances, for his high ideals both on and off the screen, with respect and affection of his colleagues."<ref name="Hesitant Hero"/>

In 1988, Stewart made an impassioned plea in Congressional hearings, along with, among many others, [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and film director [[Martin Scorsese]], against [[Ted Turner]]'s decision to '[[Film colorization|colorize]]' classic black and white films, including ''It's a Wonderful Life''. Stewart stated, "the coloring of black-and-white films is wrong. It's morally and artistically wrong and these profiteers should leave our film industry alone".<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 405.</ref>

In 1989, Stewart founded the [[American Spirit Foundation]] to apply entertainment industry resources to developing innovative approaches to public education and to assist the emerging democracy movements in the former [[Iron Curtain]] countries. [[Peter F. Paul]] arranged for Stewart, through the offices of President [[Boris Yeltsin]], to send a special print of ''It's a Wonderful Life'', translated by [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]], to Russia as the first American program ever to be broadcast on Russian television. On January 5, 1992, coinciding with the first day of the existence of the democratic [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and Russia, and the first free [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christmas Day, Russian TV Channel 2 broadcast ''It's a Wonderful Life'' to 200 million Russians who celebrated an American holiday tradition with the American people for the first time in Russian history.<ref name="imdb.com">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000071/bio "James Stewart profile."] ''IMDb.'' Retrieved March 7, 2012.</ref>

In association with politicians and celebrities such as President [[Ronald Reagan]], Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]], California Governor [[George Deukmejian]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Charlton Heston]], Stewart worked from 1987 to 1993 on projects that enhanced the public appreciation and understanding of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.<ref name="imdb.com"/>

In 1991, James Stewart voiced the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the movie ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was his last film role. Shortly before his 80th birthday, he was asked how he wanted to be remembered. "As someone who 'believed in hard work and love of country, love of family and love of community.'"<ref name="Hesitant Hero">[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0520.html "Obituary: James Stewart, the hesitant hero, dies at 89."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 3, 1997.</ref>

Stewart was ordained as a minister by the [[Universal Life Church]]. <ref name="Ashmore1977">{{cite book|author=Lewis Ashmore|title=The Modesto Messiah: The Famous Mail-order Minister|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jnvDAAAACAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Universal Press|isbn=978-0-918950-01-7}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Stewart was almost universally described by his collaborators as a kind, soft-spoken man and a true professional.<ref>Eliot 2006, pp. 164–68.</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] praised the actor as an "endearing perfectionist" with "a droll sense of humor and a shy way of watching you to see if you react to that humor."<ref name="Hesitant Hero"/>
[[File:J.StewartMarriage.jpg|right|thumb|Stewart was married to wife Gloria from 1949 to her death in 1994]]
When [[Henry Fonda]] moved to Hollywood in 1934, he was again a roommate with Stewart in an apartment in Brentwood,<ref>Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 106.</ref> and the two gained reputations as playboys.<ref>Fonda and Teichmann 1981, pp. 107–08.</ref> Both men's children later noted that their favorite activity when not working seemed to be quietly sharing time together while building and painting [[Model aircraft|model airplanes]], a hobby they had taken up in New York, years earlier.<ref>Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 97.</ref>

After World War II, Stewart settled down, at age 41, marrying former model Gloria Hatrick McLean (March 10, 1918 – February 16, 1994) on August 9, 1949. As Stewart loved to recount in self-mockery, "I, I, I pitched the big question to her last night and to my surprise she, she, she said yes!"<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 239.</ref> Stewart adopted her two sons, Michael and Ronald, and with Gloria he had twin daughters, Judy and Kelly, on May 7, 1951. The couple remained married until her death from lung cancer on February 16, 1994, at the age of 75. Ronald McLean was killed in action in [[Vietnam]] on June 8, 1969, at the age of 24, while serving as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.<ref name=NYT-GS-1994-02-18>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E1DD143BF93BA25751C0A962958260 "Gloria Stewart obituary."] ''[[The New York Times]],'' February 18, 1994.</ref><ref>[http://www.virtualwall.org/dm/McleanRW01a.htm "1LT Ronald Walsh McLean."] ''VirtualWall.org.''

Stewart was active in [[philanthropic]] affairs over the years. His signature charity event, "The Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon Race," held each year since 1982, has raised millions of dollars for the Child and Family Development Center at St. John's Health Center in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum"/> He was a lifelong supporter of [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]], having been a Second Class Scout when he was a youth, an adult Scout leader, and a recipient of the prestigious [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA). In later years, he made advertisements for the BSA, which led to his being sometimes incorrectly identified as an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref>Lawson, Terry C.

One of Stewart's lesser-known talents was his homespun poetry. He once read a poem that he had written about his dog, entitled "[[Beau (poem)|Beau]]," while on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]].'' By the end of this reading, Carson's eyes were welling with tears.<ref name=McMahonE-MSNBC-2006-09-12>McMahon, Ed.

He was also an avid gardener. Stewart purchased the house next door to his own home at 918 North Roxbury Drive, razed the house, and installed his garden in the lot.<ref>Nichols, Mary E.

Stewart was a staunch supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]<ref name="Political Donations">[http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Jimmy_Stewart.php "Political Donations."] ''newsmeat.com.'' Retrieved March 7, 2012.</ref> and actively campaigned for [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was a [[war hawk|hawk]] on the [[Vietnam War]], and maintained that his son, Ronald, did not die in vain. Stewart actively supported Reagan's bid to win the Republican presidential nomination in 1976.

Following the assassination of Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968, Stewart, [[Charlton Heston]], [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Gregory Peck]] issued a statement calling for support of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson's]] [[Gun Control Act of 1968]].

One of his best friends was fellow actor [[Henry Fonda]], despite the fact that the two had very different political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again.<ref>Robbins 1985, p. 99.</ref> This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other, we just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" However, [[Jane Fonda]] told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not know whether it was because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their movie ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]].''<ref>{{IMDb name|0000071|The Cheyenne Social Club}}</ref> In the last years of his life, he donated to the campaign of [[Bob Dole]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]] and to Democratic [[Florida]] governor [[Bob Graham]] in his successful run for the Senate.<ref name="Political Donations"/>
