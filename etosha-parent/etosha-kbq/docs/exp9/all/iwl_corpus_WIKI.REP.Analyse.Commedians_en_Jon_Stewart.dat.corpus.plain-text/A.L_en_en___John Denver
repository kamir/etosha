'''Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr.''' (December 31, 1943&nbsp;– October 12, 1997), known professionally as '''John Denver''', was an American singer-songwriter, actor, activist and humanitarian, whose greatest commercial success was as a solo singer, starting in the 1970s. He was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mademan.com/mm/10-best-selling-artists-70s.html |title=10 Best Selling Artists of the 1970s |author=Maphis, Susan  |publisher=mademan.com |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref> By 1974, he was firmly established as America's best-selling performer, and [[AllMusic]] has described Denver as "among the most beloved entertainers of his era".<ref name="John Denver AllMusic">{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-denver-mn0000811622/biography | title= John Denver Biography | publisher=AllMusic | first=Jason | last=Ankeny | accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family,<ref>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Ca-Fi/Denver-John.html Notable biographies.]</ref> Denver began his music career in [[folk music]] groups in the late 1960s. Throughout his life, Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed, with total sales of over 33 million.<ref>http://floridatheatre.com/event/john-denver-rocky-mountain-high-concert/</ref>

He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his enthusiasm for music, and his relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts, including [[country and western]], the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], in all earning him twelve [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] and four platinum albums with his signature songs "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", "[[Annie's Song]]", "[[Rocky Mountain High]]", and "[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]".

Denver further starred in films and several notable television specials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the following decade, he continued to record, but also focused on calling attention to environmental issues, lent his vocal support to space exploration, and testified in front of Congress to protest against censorship in music. He was known for his love of the state of [[Colorado]], which he sang about numerous times. He lived in [[Aspen, Colorado]], for much of his life. He was named [[Poet Laureate]] of the state in 1974. The [[Colorado]] state legislature also adopted "Rocky Mountain High" as one of its state songs in 2007. Denver was an avid pilot, and died in a single-fatality crash of his personal experimental aircraft at the age of 53.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr., was born in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], to Erma Louise Swope and Lt. Col. Henry John Deutschendorf, Sr.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/denver.html |title='&#39;Ancestry of John Denver'&#39; compiled by William Addams Reitwiesner |publisher=Wargs.Com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] officer (who set three speed records in the [[B-58 Hustler]] bomber and earned a place in the Air Force Hall of Fame).<ref>{{YouTube|0jN6hx0LCfA|Video of Denver's father flying a B-58.}}</ref> Henry Sr. was of [[German American|German]] ancestry, and met and married his "Oklahoma Sweetheart".<ref name="JD">[http://www.john-denver.org/default.asp?nc=1168&id=444 John-Denver.org]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Denver's Irish Catholic and German maternal grandmother was the one who imbued Denver with his love of music. In his autobiography, ''Take Me Home,'' Denver described his life as the eldest son of a family shaped by a stern father who could not show his love for his children.  He is also the nephew of singer Dave Deutschendorf of [[The New Christy Minstrels]].

Because [[Military brat|Denver's father was in the military]], the family moved often, making it difficult for Denver to make friends and fit in with people of his own age. Constantly being the new kid was agony for the introverted child, and he grew up always feeling as if he should be somewhere else, but never knowing where that "right" place was.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7733036/John-Denver.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=John Denver | date=October 14, 1997}}</ref> While living in [[Tucson, Arizona]], Denver was a member of the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus for two years. Denver was happy living in Tucson, but his father was transferred to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], then in the midst of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|Montgomery boycotts]]. The family later moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where Denver graduated from [[Arlington Heights High School]]. Attending high school in Fort Worth was a distressing experience for the disenfranchised Denver. In his third year of high school, he borrowed his father's car and ran away to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. His father flew to California in a friend's jet to retrieve him and Denver reluctantly returned to finish high school.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200301 |title=FindArticles biodata |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |year=2002}}</ref>

At the age of 11, Denver received an [[acoustic guitar]] from his grandmother.<ref name="bio"/> He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college. He adopted the surname "Denver" after the capital of his favorite state, [[Colorado]].  He decided to change his name when [[Randy Sparks]], founder of [[The New Christy Minstrels]], suggested that "Deutschendorf" wouldn't fit comfortably on a marquee.<ref name="sparks"/> Denver studied Architecture at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] and sang in a folk-music group called "The Alpine Trio" while pursuing architecture studies.<ref name="bio2">{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Ca-Fi/Denver-John.html |title=John Denver Biography – life, family, children, name, death, wife, young, son, born, college, contract, marriage, year, Raised in Military Family |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> He was also a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] Fraternity. Denver dropped out of the Texas Tech School of Engineering in 1963,<ref name="bio"/> and moved to Los Angeles, where he sang in folk clubs. In 1965, Denver joined the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]], a folk group that had been renamed "The Mitchell Trio" prior to Chad Mitchell's departure and before Denver's arrival, and then "Denver, Boise, and Johnson" (John Denver, David Boise, and [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]]).<ref name="bio"/>

In 1969, Denver abandoned the band life to pursue a solo career and released his first album for [[RCA Records]]: ''[[Rhymes & Reasons (John Denver album)|Rhymes & Reasons]]''. Two years prior, Denver had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. He included in the demo a song he had written called "Babe I Hate to Go", later renamed "Leaving on A Jet Plane". Denver made several copies and gave them out as presents for Christmas.<ref>[http://www.johndenver.com/current/current.html john denver: current events]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Producer [[Milt Okun]], who produced records for the Mitchell Trio and the high-profile folk group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], had become Denver's producer as well.  Okun brought the unreleased "Jet Plane" song to Peter, Paul and Mary. Their version of the song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ruhlman | first = William | title = Beginnings| publisher=Goldmine Magazine  | date = April 12, 1996 | url =http://www.peterpaulandmary.com/history/f-ruhlmann3.htm | accessdate =January 24, 2010}}</ref>

Although RCA did not actively promote ''Rhymes & Reasons'' with a tour, Denver himself embarked on an impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities as the fashion took him, offering to play free concerts at local venues. When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or local coffee-house to let him play, he would spend a day or so distributing posters in the town and could usually be counted upon to show up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} With his foot-in-the-door for authoring "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]", he was often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues would let him play for the "door"; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule, however, he had sold enough albums to persuade RCA to take a chance on extending his recording contract. He had also built a sizable and solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://johndenver.com/about/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=john denver |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref>

Denver recorded two more albums in 1970, ''[[Take Me to Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Whose Garden Was This]]'', including a mix of songs he had written and cover versions of other artists' compositions.

===Career peak===
His next album, ''[[Poems, Prayers, and Promises]]'' (released in 1971), was a breakthrough for him in the U.S., thanks in part to the single "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", which went to number 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten album with ''[[Rocky Mountain High (album)|Rocky Mountain High]],'' with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1973-02-17/hot-100 |title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs & The Hot 100 |work=Billboard  |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> Between 1974 and 1975, Denver experienced an impressive chart dominance, with a string of four No.1 songs ("[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]", "[[Annie's Song]]", "[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]", and "[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]") and three No.1 albums (''[[John Denver's Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[Back Home Again (John Denver album)|Back Home Again]]'', and ''[[Windsong]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrypolitan.com/bio-john-denver.php |title=Artist Biography – John Denver |publisher=Countrypolitan.com |date=October 12, 1997 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Denver's onstage appearance included long blond hair, embroidered shirts emblazoned with images commonly associated with the American West (created by designer & appliqué artist Anna Zapp), and "granny" glasses. His manager, Jerry Weintraub, insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in [[United Kingdom]], despite Denver's protests at the time, "I've had no success in Britain... I mean ''none''."<ref>''Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,'' James M. Martin, Pinnacle Books 1977</ref> Weintraub explained to Maureen Orth of ''Newsweek'' in December 1976, "I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people."

After appearing as a guest on many shows, Denver went on to host his own variety/music specials, including several concerts from [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] near [[Denver]]. His seasonal special, ''Rocky Mountain Christmas,'' was watched by more than 60 million people and was the highest-rated show for the ABC network at that time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[File:John Denver 1975.JPG|thumb|Denver performs for his 1975 television special ''An Evening With John Denver'']]
His live concert special, ''An Evening with John Denver,'' won the 1974–1975 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Outstanding Special, Comedy-Variety or Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0151551.html |title=Private Tutor |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> When Denver ended his business relationship because of Weintraub's focus on other projects, Weintraub threw Denver out of his office and called him a Nazi. Denver would later tell Arthur Tobier, when the latter transcribed his autobiography,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} "...I'd bend my principles to support something he wanted of me. And of course every time you bend your principles – whether because you don't want to worry about it, or because you're afraid to stand up for fear of what you might lose – you sell your soul to the devil."<ref>''Take Me Home: An Autobiography,'' John Denver and Arthur Tobier, Harmony Books, 1994.</ref>

Denver was also a guest star on ''[[The Muppet Show]],'' the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Denver and [[Jim Henson]] that spawned two television specials with [[The Muppets]]. He also tried acting, appearing in the ''The Colorado Cattle Caper'' episode of the ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'' television movie on February 24, 1974, and starring in the 1977 film ''[[Oh, God!]]'' opposite [[George Burns]]. Denver hosted the [[Grammy Award]]s five times in the 1970s and 1980s and guest-hosted ''The Tonight Show'' on multiple occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/john-denver |title=John Denver: Biography from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>
In 1975, Denver was awarded the [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year award. At the ceremony, the outgoing Entertainer of the Year [[Charlie Rich]] presented the award to his successor, but in protest of what he considered the inappropriateness of Denver's selection, Rich set fire to the envelope containing the official notification of the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/76893/episode_featured_copy.jhtml |title=The Greatest : Features |publisher=CMT.com |date=April 3, 1992 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> However, Denver's music was defended by country singer [[Kathy Mattea]], who told Alanna Nash of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]],'' "A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way... People forget how huge he was worldwide."

In 1977, Denver cofounded [[The Hunger Project]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]]. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. Denver was also appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger, writing the song "I Want to Live" as its theme song. In 1979, Denver performed "Rhymes & Reasons" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]]. Royalties from the concert performances were donated to [[UNICEF]].<ref>{{cite web|author=thepiperchile |url=http://www.abbaontv.com/1979/description-unicef1.html |title=ABBA on TV – Music for UNICEF – A Gift of Song Concert |publisher=Abbaontv.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> His father taught him to fly in the mid-1970s, which led to a reconciliation between father and son.<ref name="bio2"/> In 1980, Denver and his father, Lt. Col. "Dutch" Deutschendorf, co-hosted an award-winning television special, "The Higher We Fly: the History of Flight".<ref name="JD"/> It won the Osborn Award from the Aviation/Space Writers’ Association, and was honored by the Houston Film Festival.<ref name="JD"/>

====Political activism====
Denver became outspoken in politics in the mid-1970s. He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song "[[Calypso (song)|Calypso]]," which is an ode to [[Calypso (ship)|the exploration ship]] and team of environmental activist [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1976, he campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS crisis]]. He founded the charitable [[Windstar Foundation]] in 1976, to promote [[sustainable living]]. His dismay at the [[Chernobyl disaster]] led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.<ref name="bio2"/>

During the 1980s, Denver was critical of the [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan Presidential Administration]], but he remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1985.<ref name="bio2"/> Denver's criticism of the conservative politics of the 1980s was expressed in his autobiographical folk-rock ballad "[[One World (John Denver album)|Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For)]]." Denver was also critical of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-dominated [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|American Conservatism]] of the 1990s{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. He denounced the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) as a corrupt political machine that could buy off politicians{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, <!-- Source: The Windstar Foundation publishing of the letter, no longer posted at http://www.wstar.org/ --> and in an open letter to the media, he wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. Denver had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President [[Bill Clinton]] for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which he wrote in the midst of the 1996 presidential election, was one of the last he ever wrote.<ref name="bio2"/> Denver was also on the Board of Governors of the [[National Space Society]] for many years.

===Later years and humanitarian work===
[[File:John Denver at PMRC Senate Hearing.ogv|thumb|upright=1.2|Denver testifying before the US Senate, 1985]]
He had a few more U.S. Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and [[sustainability]] causes, focusing extensively on [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological-design researchers such as [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]] (about whom he wrote and composed "What One Man Can Do") and [[Amory Lovins]], from whom he said he learned much. He also founded two environmental groups; the Windstar Foundation and Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). Denver had a keen interest in solutions to [[hunger|world hunger]]. He visited Africa during the 1980s to witness first-hand the suffering caused by starvation and to work with African leaders toward solutions.

In 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual [[Grammy Award]]s. In the 1983 finale, Denver was joined on stage by folk-music legend [[Joan Baez]] with whom he led an all-star version of "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" and "[[Let The Sunshine In]]," joined by such diverse musical icons as [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[Donna Summer]], and [[Rick James]].

In 1984, [[Roone Arledge]], president of [[ABC Sports]], asked Denver to compose and sing the theme song for the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sarajevo]]. Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator. (Skiing was another avocation of Denver's.) He had written and composed "The Gold and Beyond," and he sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.<ref name="JD"/>

[[File:John Denver at PMRC Senate Hearing 2.ogv|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Testimony continued]]
In 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of "[[We Are the World]]," but he was turned down. According to [[Ken Kragen]] (who helped to produce the song), the reason Denver was turned down was that many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. "I didn't agree" with this assessment, Kragen said, but reluctantly turned Denver down anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrychapin.com/circle/winter05/behind.htm |title=Harry Chapin website |publisher=Harrychapin.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

For Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental TV program, ''In Partnership With Earth,'' with then–[[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] Administrator [[William K. Reilly]].

Due to his love of flying, he was attracted to [[NASA]] and became dedicated to America's work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the "Citizens in Space" program. Denver received the [[NASA Public Service Medal]], in 1985 for "helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world," an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. Also in 1985, Denver passed NASA's rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen's trip on the Space Shuttle in 1986, but he was not chosen. After the ''Challenger'' disaster with teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]] aboard, Denver dedicated his song "Flying for Me" to all astronauts, and he continued to support NASA.<ref name="JD"/>

Denver testified before the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee on the topic of censorship during a [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearing in 1985. Denver also toured Russia in 1985. His 11 Soviet Union concerts were the first by any American artist in more than 10 years, and they marked a very important cultural exchange that culminated in an agreement to allow other western artists to perform there.<ref name="Windstar_Russia_CD">{{cite web|url=http://www.wstar.org/windstar/OnlineStore/Products/russiacd.html |title='&#39;Windstar Foundation announcement'&#39; |publisher=Wstar.Com |date=September 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> He returned two years later to perform at a benefit concert for the victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. In October 1992, Denver undertook a multiple-city tour of the People's Republic of China. He also released a greatest-hits CD, "Homegrown," to raise money for homeless charities.

In 1994, he published his autobiography, ''Take Me Home,'' in which he candidly spoke of his [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[LSD]], and [[cocaine]] use, his marital infidelities, and his history of domestic violence.<ref name="ORL">''[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-11-06/news/9411051052_1_martell-chainsaws-annie Slice Of Life: Denver Tells Of Chainsaws, Choke Holds],'' The Orlando Sentinel, November 6, 1994, retrieved February 16, 2012</ref><ref name="DEN">Denver, John, ''Take Me Home: An Autobiography,'' Crown Archetype Press, ISBN 0-517-59537-0, ISBN 978-0-517-59537-4 (1994)</ref>  In 1996, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

In early 1997, Denver filmed an episode for the ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' series, centering on the natural wonders that inspired many of his best-loved songs. The episode contains his last song, "Yellowstone, Coming Home," which he composed while rafting along the [[Colorado River]] with his son and young daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/denver/index.html |title=PBS Nature Website, "John Denver – Let this be a voice" |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

In the summer of 1997, Denver recorded a children's train album for [[Sony Wonder]], titled ''[[All Aboard! (John Denver album)|All Aboard!]]'' This was produced by long-time friend [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8580588/Roger-Nichols.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Roger Nichols | date=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The album consisted of old-fashioned swing, [[big band]], [[Traditional music|folk]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]] styles of music woven into a theme of railroad songs. This album won a posthumous [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children|Best Musical Album For Children Grammy]] for Denver, which was his only [[Grammy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-d/johndenver_main.htm |title=John Denver |publisher=Rock on the Net |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Denver's first marriage was to Annie Martell of [[St. Peter, Minnesota]]. Annie was the subject of his hit ''[[Annie's Song]]'', which he composed in only ten minutes while on a ski lift in 1974.<ref name="bio2"/> The couple lived in [[Edina, Minnesota]], from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of "[[Rocky Mountain High]]", Denver purchased a residence in [[Aspen, Colorado]] and owned one home in Aspen continuously until his death.<ref>[http://www.midtod.com/98autumn/denver.phtml "John Denver: The Baby Boomer's Poet Laureate of Song"].</ref> The Denvers adopted a son, Zachary John, and daughter, Anna Kate, who Denver would say were "meant to be" theirs.<ref name="JD"/> Denver once said, "I'll tell you the best thing about me.

In 1993, Denver pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge, and was placed on probation.<ref name="STO"/> In August 1994, while still on probation, he was again charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence after crashing his Porsche into a tree in Aspen.<ref name="STO"/> Though a jury trial in July 1997 resulted in a hung jury on the second DUI charge, prosecutors later decided to reopen the case, which was closed only after Denver's accidental death in October 1997.<ref name="STO"/><ref name="CAS">Castro, Peter, [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123569,00.html "Peaks & Valleys"], ''People'', October 27, 1997, Vol. 49 No. 17, retrieved February 16, 2012</ref> In 1996, the FAA decided that Denver could no longer fly a plane due to medical disqualification for failure to abstain from [[alcohol]], a condition that the FAA had imposed in October 1995 after his prior drunk-driving conviction.<ref name="AVW">[http://www.avweb.com/other/ntsb9905.html "Close-up: The John Denver Crash"], AVWeb, retrieved February 16, 2012</ref><ref name="NTSB">National Transportation Safety Board, "NTSB Public Meeting of January 26, 1999: Aircraft Accident involving John Denver in Flight Collision with Terrain/Water October 12, 1997, Pacific Ocean near Pacific Grove, CA, LAX-98-FA008", Washington, D.C., January 26, 1999</ref>

Denver's talent extended beyond music. He was a painter as well, but because of his limiting schedule, he pursued photography. He once said that "photography is a way to communicate a feeling". Denver was an avid skier and golfer. His love of flying was secondary only to his love for music.<ref name="People">Castro, Peter. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123569,00.html "Peaks & Valleys"], ''People'', October 27, 1997.</ref> He collected vintage biplanes, and in 1974, he bought a [[Learjet]], which he used to fly himself to concerts. He also bought a [[Aviat Eagle II|Christen Eagle]] aerobatic plane, two [[Cessna 210]] airplanes, and in 1997, an experimental, amateur-built [[Rutan Long-EZ]].<ref name="JD"/><ref name="NTSB"/><ref name="People"/>

On October 12, 1997, Denver was killed at the age of 53 when his experimental [[Rutan Long-EZ]] plane, [[Aircraft registration|aircraft registration number]] N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near [[Pacific Grove, California]], while making a series of [[touch-and-go landing]]s at the nearby [[Monterey Regional Airport|Monterey Peninsula Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avweb.com/other/ntsb9905.html |title=Closeup: The John Denver Crash |publisher=Avweb.com |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> The [[National Transportation Safety Board]]'s (NTSB) accident ID is LAX98FA008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001208X09045 |title=LAX98FA008 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date=October 12, 1997 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Denver was the only occupant of the aircraft.  The crash badly disfigured Denver's head and body, making identification impossible by dental records, so records of his fingerprints were used to confirm that the fallen pilot was indeed the singer.<ref>Kligman, David. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4413095.html "John Denver Dies In Crash"], ''Chicago Sun Times'', October 13, 1997. reprinted at highbeam.com</ref><ref>[http://www.rockmine.com/Archive/Vault/DeaCert/Denver.html Certificate of Death], October 13, 1997; at rockmine.com</ref>

A pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience, Denver had [[Pilot licensing and certification|pilot license rating]]s for single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, glider, and instrument. He also held a [[type rating]] in his Learjet. He had recently purchased the Long-EZ aircraft and had taken a half-hour checkout flight with the aircraft the day before the accident.<ref>[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/John-Denver-N555JD.htm Check-Six.com] – John Denver's Long-Ez</ref><ref name="urlwww.ntsb.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/1999/990126.htm |title=Press release |author=National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) |accessdate=December 7, 2009}}</ref>

In 1996, nearly a year before the accident, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had learned of Denver's failure to abstain entirely from [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] after his [[drunk driving]] arrests and had previously revoked his medical certification.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> Since Denver was required by the FAA to have at least a [[Medical certifications for pilots|third-class medical certification]] to exercise the privileges of his pilot certificate, he was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the accident.  However, there was no trace of alcohol or other drugs in Denver's body at autopsy.<ref name=NTSB>National Transportation Safety Board. [http://dms.ntsb.gov/aviation/GenPDF.aspx?id=LAX98FA008&rpt=fa ''Long-EZ, N555JD, Flight History and Accident Report'', ID= LAX98FA008], October 12, 1997.</ref>

Post-accident investigation by the NTSB showed that the leading cause of the accident was Denver's inability to execute safely a switch of fuel tanks in flight.  The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's transfer to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings performed by Denver at the airport immediately prior to the final flight.  His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel selector valve handle configuration. Intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs, the fuel selector had instead been placed by the plane's builder behind the left shoulder of the pilot, with the fuel gauge also behind the pilot's seat and thus not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/>

Before the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle, using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]].<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> However, this did not solve the problem, as the pilot could still not reach the handle while strapped into his seat.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> 
NTSB investigators' post-accident investigation showed that given the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching the craft's fuel tanks required a pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, causing the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (move off course) and pitch up.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/>

According to the mechanic, after he had noted to Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant, Denver asked him about the quantity of fuel shown.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> The mechanic told Denver that he had "less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank".<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> The mechanic then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so that he could look over his shoulder at the fuel sight gauges; the mirror was later recovered in the wreckage.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> Denver told the mechanic that he would use the autopilot inflight, if necessary, to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> Denver declined an offer to take on additional fuel, telling the mechanic that he would only be flying for about one hour.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/>

The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses of Denver's last flight; six of them had observed the plane's crash into the ocean near Point Pinos.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> Four of the witnesses indicated that the airplane was originally heading west; five of them observed the airplane in a steep bank, with four of those five reporting the bank was to the right (north). Twelve witnesses saw the airplane in a steep nose-down descent.  Witnesses estimated the plane's height at 350 to 500 feet while heading toward the shoreline. Eight of the witnesses said that they heard a "pop" or "backfire", along with a reduction in the engine noise level just before the airplane descended into the water.

The NTSB determined that, in addition to Denver's failure to refuel the plane prior to takeoff and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, there were several key contributing factors. Primary among these were the pilot's inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the plane's builder's decision to locate the unmarked fuel selector handle in a hard-to-access position.<ref name="AVW"/><ref name="NTSB"/> Subsequent to its investigation, the board issued its recommendations regarding the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots engaged in operating experimental aircraft. The board also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access of all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.

Upon announcement of Denver's death, Colorado governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half staff]] in his honor.  Funeral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in [[Aurora, Colorado]], on October 17, 1997, officiated by Pastor Les Felker, a retired Air Force chaplain, following which Denver's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Rocky Mountains.  Further tributes were made at the following Grammys and [[Country Music Association|Country Music Association Awards]]. On September 23, 2007, nearly ten years after Denver's death, his brother Ron witnessed the dedication of a plaque placed near the crash site in Pacific Grove, California, commemorating the singer.

In 2000, CBS presented the television movie ''Take Me Home: The John Denver Story'' loosely based on his memoirs, starring [[Chad Lowe]]. The ''New York Post'' observed, "An overachiever like John Denver couldn't have been this boring."<ref>Buckman, Adam. "Home Movie Disses Denver", ''[[New York Post]]'', April 29, 2000.</ref>

Denver's music remains popular around the world. Previously unreleased and unnoticed recordings are now sought-after collectibles in pop, folk and country genres.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Also in demand are copies of Denver's many television appearances, especially his one-hour specials from the 1970s and his six-part series for Britain's BBC, ''The John Denver Show''. Despite strong interest in these programs, no sign of "official" release is evident for the vast majority of this material.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} An anthology musical featuring Denver's music, ''Back Home Again: A John Denver Holiday'', premiered at the Rubicon Theatre Company in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shellworld.net/~emily/jdfriend.html |title=John Denver and Friends Rocky Mountain High WWW Page |publisher=Shellworld.net |date=April 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

On March 12, 2007, the [[Colorado Senate]] passed a resolution to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit "[[Rocky Mountain High]]" one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, "[[Where the Columbines Grow]]".<ref>http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm Accessed April 16, 2009</ref> The resolution passed 50–11 in the House, defeating an objection by Rep. [[Debbie Stafford]] (R-[[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]]) that the song reflected drug use, most specifically the line, "friends around the campfire and everybody's high". Sen. [[Bob Hagedorn]], the Aurora Democrat who sponsored the proposal, defended the song as nothing to do with drugs, but everything to do with sharing with friends the euphoria of experiencing the beauty of Colorado's mountain vistas. Nancy Todd (D-Aurora) said that "John Denver to me is an icon of what Colorado is."<ref>Denver Post, March 13, 2007</ref>

On September 24, 2007, the California Friends of John Denver and The Windstar Foundation unveiled a bronze plaque near the spot where his plane went down near Pacific Grove. The site had been marked by a driftwood log carved (by Jeffrey Pine of Colorado) with the singer's name, but fears that the memorial could be washed out to sea sparked the campaign for a more permanent memorial. Initially the Pacific Grove Council denied permission for the memorial, fearing the place would attract ghoulish curiosity from extreme fans. Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of the singer's family. Eventually, over 100 friends and family attended the dedication of the plaque, which features a [[bas-relief]] of the singer's face and lines from his song "Windsong": "So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers. Follow her summons when she calls again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johndenverclub.org/JohnDenverPlaque/johndenvermemorialplaquepacificgrove.html |title=John Denver Memorial Plaque Pacific Grove |publisher=Johndenverclub.org |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>

To mark the 10th anniversary of Denver's death, his family released a set of previously unreleased recordings of Denver's 1985 concert performances in the [[Soviet Union]]. This two-CD set, ''John Denver – Live in the USSR'', was produced by Denver's friend [[Roger Nichols (recording engineer)|Roger Nichols]], and released by AAO Music. These digital recordings were made during 11 concerts, and then rediscovered in 2002. Included in this set is a previously unpublished rendition of "[[Annie's Song]]" in Russian. The collection was released November 6, 2007.<ref name="Windstar_Russia_CD" />

On October 13, 2009, a DVD box set of previously unreleased concerts recorded throughout Denver's career was released by [[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]. ''Around the World Live'' is a 5-disc DVD set featuring three complete live performances with full band from Australia in 1977, Japan in 1981, and England in 1986. These are complemented by a solo acoustic performance from Japan in 1984, and performances at [[Farm Aid]] from 1985, 1987 and 1990. The final disc has two-hour-long documentaries made by Denver.

On April 21, 2011, Denver became the first inductee into the [[Colorado Music Hall of Fame]]. A benefit concert was held at Broomfield's [[1stBank Center]] and hosted by [[Olivia Newton-John]]. Other performers participating in the event included [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Lee Ann Womack]] and [[John Oates]]. Both of his ex-wives were in attendance, and the award was presented to his three children.

The [[John Denver "Spirit" statue]] is a 2002 bronze sculpture statue that was financed by Denver's fans.

On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make "Take Me Home, Country Roads" the official state song of West Virginia. Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed the resolution into law on March 8.<ref>http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/140307_23786.shtml</ref> Denver thus shares the distinction with the father of American music, [[Stephen Foster]] as the composer of two state songs.<ref>http://inmozartsfootsteps.com/983/john-denver-composer-of-two-state-songs/</ref>

The band's albums were released on Denver's Windsong Records (later known as [[Windstar Records]]) label.
