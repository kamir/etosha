===Joint Chiefs of Staff===
On June 8, 2007, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert M. Gates]] announced that he would advise President [[George W. Bush]] to nominate Mullen to succeed General [[Peter Pace]] as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]];<ref name=CNN_20070608>{{cite news

On August 3, 2007, the U.S. Senate confirmed Mullen as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<ref name=senateconf1>{{cite news

|title= Senate confirms Mullen as new military chief
|date=August 4, 2007
|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> Mullen was sworn in on October 1, 2007. Upon taking office, Mullen became the first naval officer to hold the Chairman's position since Admiral [[William J. Crowe|William Crowe]], who served as Chairman prior to the enactment of the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] in 1986, and who was the immediate predecessor to Army [[General (United States)|general]] and later [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]].

On March 18, 2009, Gates recommended to President [[Barack Obama]] that Mullen be re-nominated for a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs.<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=53539 Gates Recommends New Terms, Positions for Senior Officers]</ref> He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on September 25, 2009<ref name=senateconf2>{{cite news

|title= Mullen Confirmed to Second Term as Joint Chiefs Chairman
|date=September 25, 2009
|publisher=SENATUS}}</ref> and began his second term on October 1, 2009.

On February 2, 2010, Mullen and Gates said that they fully supported President Obama’s decision to end the "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" law, which prevented openly gay people from serving in the military. “It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do,” Mullen said at a [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] hearing. “No matter how I look at the issue...I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens...For me, it comes down to integrity&nbsp;– theirs as individuals and ours as an institution.”

===2007 Senate testimony regarding the Iraq War===
During Mullen's Senate confirmation hearings for his first term nomination as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mullen identified political progress in Iraq as a critical component of Iraq policy.<ref name=Iraqviews>{{cite news
|accessdate=August 4, 2007
|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-30-us-iraq_N.htm?csp=34
|title= Nominee Mullen: Little political progress in Iraq
|date=August 1, 2007
|work=USA Today}}</ref> He noted that, "there does not appear to be much political progress" in Iraq.<ref name=Iraqviews/> He also said, "If [the Iraqis] aren't making progress in [the political] realm, the prospects for movement in a positive direction are not very good. Failure to achieve tangible progress toward [political] reconciliation requires a strategic reassessment."<ref name=Iraqviews/> Mullen further told the Senate that the United States needs to "bring as much pressure on [Iraq's political leaders] as [the U.S.] possibly can."<ref name=Iraqviews/>

Regarding the length and scope of the U.S. involvement in Iraq, Mullen told the Senate that while he does not envision permanent U.S. bases in Iraq, "vital interests in the region and in Iraq require a pragmatic, long-term commitment that will be measured in years, not months."<ref name=Iraqviews/>

===Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010===

President Obama, Secretary of Defense Panetta and Admiral Mullen provided the certification required by the Act to Congress on July 22, 2011. Implementation of repeal was completed 60 days later, so that [[DADT]] was no longer policy as of September 20, 2011.

===Views on use of military force===
In a speech at Kansas State University,<ref>Mullen, Mike. [http://www.jcs.mil/speech.aspx?ID=1336# Landon Lecture Series Remarks], March 3, 2010, Kansas State University.</ref> Mullen outlined his views about the best application of military force in present times. He characterized most wars, such as World War II, as wars of attrition, where the reduction or elimination of enemy forces signaled victory. He characterized the Cold War as an issue of containment. In characterizing the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he described them as "a fight against a syndicate of Islamic extremists led by al-Qaeda and supported by a host of both state and non-state actors", citing the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan as their "epicenter".

Mullen outlined three principles about the "proper use of modern military forces":

* '''Military power should not be the last resort of the state:''' Mullen pointed to the readiness and capacity of military forces to respond to crises as reason to deploy them sooner, rather than later, in response. "We can, merely by our presence, help alter certain behavior."

* '''Force should be applied in a precise and principled way:''' Mullen cites the sacrifice involved in deployment as requiring extreme care. Secondly, Mullen argues that "the battlefield isn’t necessarily a field anymore.  It’s in the minds of the people." He cites General McChrystal's restriction of night raids as an example of this 2nd principle in action.

* '''Policy and strategy should constantly engage with one another:''' Given that current engagements are open-ended, Mullen posits that military strategy must be more constantly engaged with policy. "...war has never been a set-piece affair.  The enemy adapts to your strategy and you adapt to his." He cites the review process which led to the current Afghanistan escalation as a model of engagement between military leaders and policy makers.

==Retirement==
President [[Barack Obama]] nominated General [[Martin Dempsey|Martin E. Dempsey]] as the next chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] on [[Memorial Day]]. Dempsey had been sworn in as Army chief of staff the previous month. On September 30, 2011, Mullen officially retired from the military when his term as Chairman ended.

In December 2012, one year into his retirement, the Admiral was in the news again, for having been the target of a [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]], a situation that led to subsequent [[FBI]] investigations.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323316804578161571035393836.html ''Hackers Hit Ex-Military Head''] December 5, 2012</ref> In 2013, Mullen joined the [[Board of directors|board]] of [[General Motors]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Former Joint Chiefs chair Mullen joins GM board |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/01/ap-former-joint-chiefs-chair-joins-gm-board-013113 |newspaper=Army Times |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>

On July 11, 2013 the Admiral was put on the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel Corp (NYSE:S) directly after a buyout from SoftBank, one of Japan's largest cellular companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/news-releases/sprint-and-softbank-announce-completion-of-merger.htm |title=Sprint and SoftBank Announce Completion of Merger |publisher=Sprint.com |date=July 10, 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}</ref>
