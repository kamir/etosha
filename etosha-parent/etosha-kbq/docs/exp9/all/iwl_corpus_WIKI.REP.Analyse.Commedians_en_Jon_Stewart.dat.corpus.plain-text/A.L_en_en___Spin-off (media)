In [[Mass media|media]], a '''spin-off''' is a [[radio program]], [[television program]], [[video game]], film, or any narrative work, derived from one or more already existing works, that focuses, in particular, in more detail on one aspect of that original work (e.g. a particular topic, character, or event). A spin-off may be called a '''sidequel''' when it exists in the same chronological frame of time as its predecessor work.<ref>{{cite web|author=December 4, 2006 |url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/sidequel_1/ |title=sidequel |publisher=Doubletongued.org |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> One of the earliest spin-offs of the modern media era, if not the first, happened in 1941 when the supporting character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve from the [[old time radio]] comedy show ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' became the star of his own program ''[[The Great Gildersleeve]]'' (1941–1957).<ref>Dunning, John R (1998).

In [[genre fiction]], the term parallels the usage in television; it is usually meant to indicate a substantial ''change in narrative viewpoint and activity'' from that (previous) [[Narrative thread|storyline]] based on the activities of the series' principal protagonist(s) and so is a shift to that action and overall [[narrative thread]] of some other protagonist(s), which now becomes the central or main thread (storyline) of the new sub-series. The ''new protagonist'' generally appears first as a minor or supporting character in the main story line within a given milieu, and it is very common for the previous protagonist to have a supporting or cameo role, at the least as a historical mention, in the new sub-series. Spin offs, sometimes generate their own spin-offs, leaving the new show only vaguely connected to the original series.

==Examples of notable spin-offs==

===Name changes or retoolings===
* The main character from ''[[All in the Family]]'', Archie Bunker, continued in a retooled version of the series called ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'', which then spun off ''[[Gloria (TV series)|Gloria]]'', the story of the Bunker's now-divorced daughter.
* After ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' ended its run, due to star [[Beatrice Arthur|Bea Arthur]]'s decision to leave the show, the other three stars—[[Rue McClanahan]], [[Betty White]] and [[Estelle Getty]]—reprised their characters in a follow-up series entitled ''[[The Golden Palace]]''. It lasted 24 episodes.
* After the seventh year of ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]'', most of the main characters returned the next season for ''[[Da Vinci's City Hall]]''. The new series carries over some of the same plot threads, the difference being a slight shift in themes that began in the last season of the original series. ''City Hall'' is sometimes even referred to as the eighth season of ''Inquest''.
* Before the 11th season of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' the seven principal cast members voted whether that season would be the series' last.  Following the series' conclusion, the three actors to vote for continuation, [[William Christopher]], [[Jamie Farr]], and [[Harry Morgan]], appeared in the post-war series ''[[AfterMASH]]'', which lasted less than two complete seasons.
* The popular cartoon ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' was brought back after cancellation with a new name and a new smoother animation style. ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' only lasted 24 episodes. It is later replaced by another spin-off ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', lasted 52 episodes.
* The characters played by [[Lynda Bellingham]] and [[Julia Sawalha]] in the UK TV series ''[[Second Thoughts (series)|Second Thoughts]]'' later reappeared in the series ''[[Faith in the Future]]''.
* Six years after the British sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' ended, a new series started up featuring five of the six cast members from the final season of the original show. The new show was entitled ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' (aired in the United States as ''Are You Being Served? Again!'') and featured the characters from the original show transplanted into a new setting.
* After three series of the prison-based sit-com ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'', the main character of Norman Stanley Fletcher was released from prison and the show was retooled as ''[[Going Straight]]''. It sees Fletcher trying to re-emerge as a valued member of society, having vowed to stay away from crime on his release.
* At the end of its seventh season, ''[[Three's Company]]'' became ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' following the marriage of Janet ([[Joyce DeWitt]]) and the departure of Terri ([[Priscilla Barnes]]).  Jack ([[John Ritter]]) moves in with his girlfriend Vicky ([[Mary Cadorette]]) in an apartment above his restaurant, located in a building subsequently bought by her disapproving father ([[Robert Mandan]]).  This development ended the gay ruse, with Mr. Furley ([[Don Knotts]]) taking credit for Jack's "conversion".
* The cult Nickelodeon hit cartoon franchise ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' was retooled as ''[[Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon]]'' which aired on [[Spike TV]] and lasted only seven episodes.
* After ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'' ended, the series was retooled as ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]''. It involves [[Zack Martin]], [[Cody Martin]], [[London Tipton]] and [[Mr. Moseby]] staying on a cruise ship. <!--- ''The Suite Life on Deck'' being listed under "Name changes or retoolings" is extremely suspect and likely invalid as that series also features both the two lead and two of the supporting actors/characters from the original series. --->
* Having succeeded with ''[[Isa TKM]]'', the original [[telenovela]]-like teen program from [[Nickelodeon Latin America]], it has a spin-off named ''[[Isa TK+]]'', with some of the same and new main characters, and new support characters.
* After ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' ended with the [[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers|miniseries]], the show was retooled as ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'', which involved five of the six Rangers [[Tommy Oliver]], [[Rocky DeSantos]], [[Adam Park]], [[Billy Cranston]] and [[Katherine Hillard]] entering into the rebuilt Command Center, with the four Rangers alongside with new Ranger [[Tanya Sloan]] becoming the Zeo Rangers and Billy retiring as a Ranger by becoming the technical advisor to the team.
* [[Girl Meets World]] is a spin-off of [[Boy Meets World]] where the shows revolves around Cory and Topanga's daughter Riley and her best friend Maya.
* Crash fom [[Crash and Bernstein]] is getting a spin-off called Commando Crash

===Support character getting own show (during run)===

* ''[[All in the Family]]'' is responsible for several spin-offs. ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' both featured characters that began on ''All in the Family''. ''[[Good Times]]'' was later spun off from ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', making it the first spin-off of a spin-off.
* ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' spun off ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'', based on supporting characters, as well as several unsuccessful series pilots and one TV movie.
* ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' spun off  ''[[Young Hercules]]'', which relates the adventures of Hercules during his teenage years. And more notably, sister show ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' emerged from ''Hercules'', eventually outlasting and out-rating its parent programme.

In an unusual turn of events, even though Bonet was written out of ''A Different World'' after the first season and returned to ''The Cosby Show'', ''A Different World'' continued &ndash; and thrived &ndash; for another five seasons without her.
* The only two daytime [[soap opera]]s to spin off a primetime soap are  ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and ''[[General Hospital]]''. In 1965, the producers capitalized on the popularity of the character [[Lisa Grimaldi|Lisa Miller Hughes]] and created a limited-run show for her character, called ''[[Our Private World]]''. A year after the nighttime show ended, [[Eileen Fulton]], Lisa's portrayer, returned to ''ATWT'', where she remained until the soap's cancellation in 2010. ''General Hospital'', from 1997 to 2003, had the spin-off soap, ''[[Port Charles]]'' that included the ''GH'' characters [[Lucy Coe]], [[Kevin Collins (General Hospital)|Kevin Collins]], and [[Scott Baldwin]].

* ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]'' was another spin-off from the movie ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''.  When sued by the makers of the series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', the makers of ''Trapper John'' demonstrated in court that it was derived from the movie rather than the series.

The first, in 1981, was an unsuccessful pilot featuring [[Sarah Jane Smith]], called ''[[K-9 and Company]]''.  ''[[Wartime (Doctor Who)|Wartime]]'' (1987) is about the adventures of some of the UNIT personnel. The 1995 film ''[[Shakedown: Return of the Sontarans]]'' features one of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s antagonist races, but for licensing reasons not the Doctor himself. In the 1990s, [[Reeltime Pictures|Reeltime]] distributed ''[[PROBE]]'', a series of five made-for-video movies featuring [[Caroline John]] as her [[Jon Pertwee|Pertwee]]-era character, Dr. [[Liz Shaw|Elizabeth Shaw]]. BBC, on their part, produced and released a series of movies based on one of Dr. Who's villains: ''Auton'', ''Auton 2: Sentinel'' and ''Auton 3''. In 2006 the BBC launched another spin-off, ''[[Torchwood]]'', aimed at a more adult audience and featuring Captain [[Jack Harkness]] from the newer series. ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' and ''[[K-9 (TV show)|K-9]]'' are more child-oriented than ''Doctor Who''.  There is also an animated serial ''[[The Infinite Quest]]''.
* Even reality shows can have spin-offs. ''[[Trauma: Life in the E.R.]]'' spawned two additional reality shows in the early 2000s from a set of ''Trauma'' episodes shot at [[New Orleans]]' [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]], ''[[Paramedics (TV show)|Paramedics]]'' and ''[[Code Blue New Orleans]]''.

* ''[[Family Guy]]'' supporting character [[Cleveland Brown]] was given his own show called ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.
* ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' is an example of several different types of spin-offs.

When ''The Andy Griffith Show'' proved successful, the supporting character of [[Gomer Pyle]] ([[Jim Nabors]]) was spun off into ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' Finally, when Griffith left the show in 1967, it was re-tooled for three more seasons as ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]''
* When [[Lauren Conrad]] left the reality series ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]'', she began a new reality series ''[[The Hills]]'', which in turn spawned ''[[The City (MTV series)|The City]]'' when [[Whitney Port]] moved to New York.
* ''[[Family Matters]]'' is a spinoff of ''[[Perfect Strangers (U.S. TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]''.  Carl Winslow, the main character of ''Family Matters'', was featured in an episode of ''Perfect Strangers''.

**Many of the other sketches and guest appearances of popular Mexican comedians would evolve into ''[[Humor es...los comediantes]]'' (1999-2001).  For the entirety of both programs' runs there was a certain interplay between those shows, with cast members of one series appearing on another (Ortiz de Pinedo, [[Carlos Espejel]], and [[Shamila]] were regular cast members on both series, and [[Maria Alicia Delgado]], [[Teo Gonzalez]] and [[Aida Pierce]] were regulars on one series and guests on another), and guest comedians on the latter series also guesting on the former.
***''Cero en conducta'''s sequel series was ''[[La Escuelita VIP]]'' (2005)
****Ortiz de Pinedo invited back many of the same comedians who guested on the aforementioned series for ''[[Festival del humor]]'' (2002-05) and ''[[Fabrica de risas]]'' (2006-09).
****Frequent ''Humor es...los Comediantes'' guest [[Mara Escalante]] starred in her own series ''[[Maria de todos los angeles]] (2009-present), playing several of the same characters she had portrayed on the former series, including the title character.

===Crossovers===
{{main|Fictional crossover}}

Sometimes even where a show is not a spin-off from another, there will nevertheless be [[fictional crossover|crossovers]], where a character from one show makes an appearance on another. A notable example of this is [[Ursula Buffay|Ursula]] and [[Phoebe Buffay]], twin sisters played by [[Lisa Kudrow]] who normally are on different shows, ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'' respectively, but sometimes meet. This is also done by [[Ray Romano]] and [[Kevin James (actor)|Kevin James]] with ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[King of Queens]]''. Additionally, Romano appeared on an episode of ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'' where it was revealed that the characters Ray and Fran attended the same high school. [[Steve Urkel]] from ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' was also shown to be the cousin of one of [[D.J. Tanner|D.J.'s]] friends on ''[[Full House]]''. The title character from ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' appeared in episodes of ''[[The Practice]]'', both David E. Kelley shows. [[Steven Harper (Boston Public)|Steven Harper]], the main character from ''[[Boston Public]]'' who played the principal of a Boston high school, appeared as a client in ''[[Boston Legal]]'' a year after ''Boston Public'' was taken off the air.  These two were also David E. Kelley shows. Harper also was represented by Young, Frutt and Berlutti in ''[[The Practice]]'', the show that preceded ''[[Boston Legal]]''. Therefore, all four shows were in the same universe.

Sometimes (often in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', which also have a comic series named ''Crossover Crisis'') characters will appear in the background, often as part of a crowd.

Sometimes crossovers are created in an attempt to provide closure to fans of another failed series. For example, ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]''’s characters Frank & Jordan Black (played by [[Lance Henriksen]] and [[Brittany Tiplady]]) appeared alongside [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] in ''[[The X-Files]]'' 1999 episode "Millennium" (episode #7.05). This allowed the fans to have some closure, as none was given when ''Millennium'' was abruptly canceled prior to the 1999 season.

Sometimes show producers will re-introduce a character from an older series into a later one as a way of providing a connectivity of that particular producer's television "universe". Television producer [[Glen A. Larson]] is particularly known for this; for example, the character of Jonathan Chase (played by [[Simon MacCorkindale]]) from Glen A. Larson's failed 1980s series ''[[Manimal]]'' appeared in an episode of Larson's syndicated 1990s series ''[[Night Man]]''.
