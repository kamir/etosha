'''''The O'Reilly Factor''''', originally titled '''''The O'Reilly Report''''' from 1996 to 1998<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/6417561/mad_dog/] Cloapinto, John. (2004-08-11). "Mad Dog", ''Rolling Stone''{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> and often called '''''The Factor''''', is an [[United States cable news|American cable television news]] and [[talk show]] on the [[Fox News Channel]] hosted by [[pundit (politics)|political commentator]] [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], who often discusses current controversial political issues with guests.  As of 2015, ''The O'Reilly Factor'' was the most-watched cable news program in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Q1 2015 Ratings: CNN Makes Big Demo Gains, MSNBC Hits Record Lows, Fox Continues Victories|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/q1-2015-ratings-cnn-makes-big-demo-gains-msnbc-hits-record-lows-fox-continues-victories/|website=Mediaite|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>

''The O'Reilly Factor'' is generally prerecorded, though on rare occasions it airs live if breaking news or special events are being covered (e.g. [[Oval Office Address|presidential addresses]] that occur during prime-time). It is usually taped between 5:00 and 7:00 PM [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] and airs weekdays at 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM.  The show is recorded "live to tape", meaning that the recording breaks for commercials as if the show was actually on the air while being recorded.  Some guests are interviewed before the "live to tape" period and are slotted in the program as appropriate.<ref>{{cite web

For each show, O'Reilly, with the assistance of his staff, will produce a script with the words for the "Talking Points Memo" and "Tip of the Day" segments, and points of discussion and questions for the guests that will appear on the program.

On February 2, 2009, the show launched in high definition and moved to the studio previously used by the ''[[Fox Report]]''.

Radio talk show host [[Laura Ingraham]] is the current{{When|date = April 2015}} regular guest host, though [[Mike Huckabee]], [[Juan Williams]], [[Monica Crowley]], [[Eric Bolling]], and [[Greg Gutfeld]] have also filled in.

==Segments==
The show is divided into titled segments, appearing in the following general order. Not all segments appear in all programs, and occasionally segments will repeat.
* '''Truth Serum:''' A segment in which O'Reilly evaluates a statement made by a politician for truthfulness.
* '''Talking Points Memo:''' O'Reilly's commentary on a current event or the state of the country.
* '''Top Story:''' O'Reilly covers one of the important news stories of the day, with interviews with newsmakers, noted analysts, or Fox News Channel reporters. If there is nothing breaking, the ''Top Story'' will often expand on the subject covered in the ''Talking Points Memo'' with a guest that either rebuts or concurs with the memo.
* '''Impact:''' O'Reilly focuses on issues of crime and the law in this segment. Updates on criminal investigations, trials, and lawsuits are highlighted. Other times, issues relating to government relations and agencies are featured, as are stories about the Iraq War.
* '''Unresolved Problem:''' O'Reilly focuses on an issue that he feels is not sufficiently covered by other media.
* '''Personal Story:''' O'Reilly invites an author of a best selling book, a newsmaker thrust into the spotlight, someone who has experienced an event currently in the news, or someone who has interviewed a newsmaker.
* '''Factor Follow-Up:''' O'Reilly revisits an issue discussed in a previous edition of the ''Factor''.
* '''Back of the Book:''' Various topics will be placed in this segment, which is one of the last segments (hence the name). Two examples are "Reality Check" and the "Great American Culture Quiz", in which O'Reilly quizzes two Fox News colleagues (usually [[Steve Doocy]] and [[Martha MacCallum]]) on [[pop culture]].
* '''Factor Mail:''' O'Reilly reads brief snippets of [[Email]] sent to him. He frequently puts together letters that have opposite viewpoints on a particular segment. For instance, one letter will say O'Reilly was excessively lenient toward a guest while the next will say he was excessively hard on him. He will also frequently read out a short verse, usually a [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]].
* '''Pinheads and Patriots:''' A segment where O'Reilly praises someone he feels has done good things for the country or the culture, while chastising someone else he feels is committing specific harm or has simply made some sort of embarrassing blunder.  In an experimental version of the segment, during early 2011, O'Reilly would roll a clip and the viewers would vote on whether the people in clip were "Patriotic" or "Pinheaded"; the new format was eventually scrapped and O'Reilly returned to declaring his "Pinheads" and "Patriots" unilaterally. The segment was retired in July 2012 and replaced with Tip of the Day. (Although "Pinheads of the Week" has since become a semi-regular segment on the show, somewhat replacing the daily segment.)
* '''What the Heck Just Happened?:''' Bill talks with comedian [[Greg Gutfeld]] and talk-radio personality [[Bernard McGuirk]] about odd news stories of the week, or just to get their unique perspective on current events. Usually airs at the bottom of the hour each Friday, often accompanied with a bonus segment called "Pinheads of the Week."
* '''Tip of the Day:''' At the end of each broadcast O'Reilly shares words of wisdom on daily living.
* '''Word of the Day:''' When providing the email address for viewers to write, O'Reilly will state that when writing, "don't be" followed by a lesser-known word (i.e., "[[wiktionary:jejune|jejune]]", "[[wiktionary:morose|morose]]", "a [[wiktionary:blooter|blooter]]"), implicitly challenging his viewers to discover the word's meaning.

Occasionally, the following segments appear:

* '''Barack and a Hard Place:''' A weekly segment where the best and worst things that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] has done during the week are talked about with [[Alan Colmes]] and [[Monica Crowley]].
* '''Children at Risk:''' O'Reilly covers issues relating to the health and well-being of children and adolescents.
* '''Charles in Charge:''' A regular segment where O'Reilly seeks commentary from [[Charles Krauthammer]] about the week's political events.
* '''Culture War:''' This segment which O'Reilly debates social issues that divide the country.
* '''Culture Warriors''' O'Reilly talks to [[Jeanine Pirro]] and [[Gretchen Carlson]] about various subjects. ([[Margaret Hoover]] initially took Pirro's spot on the panel, until 2011.)
* '''Did You See That?:''' Video clips are shown and discussed with [[Dagen McDowell]].
* '''Pinheads of the Week:''' Friday segment where the dumbest people of the week are nominated and discussed with [[Bernard McGuirk]] and [[Greg Gutfeld]]. Formerly called ''Dumbest Things of the Week'', which featured [[Arthel Neville]], and not McGuirk, as the second panelist.
* '''Factor Investigation:''' O'Reilly invites guests who have investigated a person or organization that O'Reilly has criticized.
* '''Fridays with Geraldo:''' [[Geraldo Rivera]], of the Fox News-produced and syndicated ''[[Geraldo At Large]]'', discusses a topic of interest to O'Reilly. Sometimes its own segment; other times rolled into one of the above segments.
* '''Kelly File:''' A segment where O'Reilly talks to [[Megyn Kelly]]. (It is not known whether this segment will continue, now that Kelly is hosting her own primetime show by the same name.)
* '''Great American News Quiz:''' Trivia questions are answered by [[Steve Doocy]] and [[Martha MacCallum]].
* '''The Ingraham Angle:''' A segment where O'Reilly talks to [[Laura Ingraham]].
* '''Is It Legal:''' [[Lis Wiehl]] and [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]] talk about legal matters.
* '''Miller Time:'''  A Wednesday segment where O'Reilly talks to [[Dennis Miller]].
* '''Policing the ...:''' A segment where O'Reilly reviews several sources for normally outlandish content. The "the" in the name is usually followed up by "net" (Internet), or Media.
* '''The Most R!d!culous Item of the Day:''' Replaced by "Pinheads & Patriots," it was a brief segment highlighting an offbeat news item.
* '''Factor Flashback:''' Normally aired during episodes in which someone fills in for O'Reilly; a replay of a previously aired segment.
* ''' Weekdays with Bernie:''' A segment where [[Bernard Goldberg]] discusses topics with O'Reilly (generally this segment will appear on Mondays).
* ''' Lou's the Boss:''' Business and economic issues are discussed with [[Lou Dobbs]]
* ''' Watters' World:''' A segment that airs every two weeks on Monday, in which Factor producer [[Jesse Watters]] talks to the younger generation about a broad range of issues.
* '''Rollin' With Carolla:''' A weekly segment with outspoken comedian and radio personality [[Adam Carolla]] that deals with various social, political and religious issues.

==Parodies==
In 2005, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' premiered on [[Comedy Central]]. The show, hosted by [[Stephen Colbert]], is a [[satirical]] [[Parody|spoof]] of pundit shows like ''The O'Reilly Factor'', spoofing its format and the mannerisms and ideology of O'Reilly, whom Colbert calls "Papa Bear." Colbert makes no secret of his spoofing O'Reilly: upon hearing the news that O'Reilly approved of ''The Colbert Report'', he declared on-air that "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist."<ref name="NYTIMES25Q">{{cite news|first=Deborah|last=Solomon|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25questions.html|title=Funny About the News|work=New York Times Magazine|date=2005-09-25|accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>  On January 18, 2007, Colbert appeared on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and O'Reilly appeared on '' The Colbert Report''.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,,00.html Stephen Colbert Enters the No Spin Zone].

''The O'Reilly Factor'' has also been spoofed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', first by [[Jeff Richards (comedian)|Jeff Richards]] and later on by [[Darrell Hammond]]. On ''[[MADtv]]'' it was [[Michael McDonald (actor)|Michael McDonald]] doing the honors. O'Reilly himself has appeared on ''MADtv''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639195/fullcredits |title="MADtv" Episode #9.17 (2004) - Full cast and crew |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> Richards also played O'Reilly in an episode of [[Mind of Mencia]] where O'Reilly is a senator in the year 2016.

The show was also spoofed by the TV series ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]''; first in the episode "[[The Trial of R. Kelly]]" where O'Reilly is shown talking about [[R. Kelly|R. Kelly's]] latest legal trouble. Later in "[[Return of the King (The Boondocks)|Return of the King]]", O'Reilly is shown attacking [[Martin Luther King Jr|Martin Luther King]] for saying that America should "love thy enemy" and "turn the other cheek", even in respects to the [[9/11 attacks]].

[[CNNNN]], an Australian comedy show which satirized cable news, featured a recurring segment entitled ''The Firth Factor''. These segments typically showed [[Charles Firth (comedian)|Charles Firth]], a member of [[the Chaser]] comedy team, presenting his opinion on topical issues, often through use of over-the-top comparisons (such as dipping a paper heart in a can of black paint and claiming: "This is how black [[Saddam Hussein]]'s heart is") and outrageous statements in a parody of O'Reilly and Australian current affairs personalities.  The [[Chaser's War on Everything]] also featured a segment in its second season where it poked fun at the O'Reilly factor.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
