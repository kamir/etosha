'''Inner Mongolia''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: <small>[[Mongolian script|s]]</small> {{MongolUnicode|ᠦᠪᠦᠷ<br />ᠮᠤᠩᠭᠤᠯ}} ''{{Unicode|Öbür Monggol}}'' and <small>[[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|c]]</small> {{linktext|Өвөр}} {{linktext|Монгол}}, ''Övör Mongol''; {{zh|s={{linktext|内蒙古}}|p=Nèi Měnggǔ}}), officially '''Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region''' or '''Nei Mongol Autonomous Region''', is an [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous region]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], located in the north of the country, containing most of China's border with [[Mongolia]] (the rest of the China-Mongolia border is taken up by the [[Xinjang]] and Gansu provinces) and a small section of the border with [[Russia]]. Its capital is [[Hohhot]], and other major cities include [[Baotou]], [[Chifeng]], and [[Ordos City|Ordos]].

The Autonomous Region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] provinces of [[Suiyuan]], [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Rehe Province|Rehe]], [[Liaobei Province|Liaobei]] and [[Xing'an Province|Xing'an]], along with the northern parts of [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]].
It is the third largest subdivision of China, spanning approximately {{convert|1,200,000|km2|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} or 12% of China's total land area. It had a population of 24,706,321 at the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 census]], accounting for 1.84% of [[Mainland China]]'s total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's [[List of People's Republic of China administrative divisions by population|23rd]] most populous [[Provinces of China|province-level division]].<ref name="Census2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/statisticaldata/censusdata/rkpc2010/indexch.htm|title=TABULATION ON THE 2010 POPULATION CENSUS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA|work=stats.gov.cn}}</ref> The majority of the population in the region are [[Han Chinese]], with a substantial [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] minority. The official languages are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the latter written in the [[Mongolian script|traditional Mongolian script]], as opposed to the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]] used in the state of Mongolia.

==Name==
In Chinese, the region is known as "Inner Mongolia", where the terms of "Inner/Outer" are derived from [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''dorgi''/''tulergi'' (cf. [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''dotugadu''/''gadagadu''). Inner Mongolia is distinct from [[Outer Mongolia]], which was a term used by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent [[sovereign state|state]] of [[Mongolia]] plus the Republic of [[Tuva]] in [[Russia]]. In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the region was called ''Dotugadu monggol'' during [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Qing rule]] and was renamed into ''Öbür Monggol'' in 1947, ''öbür'' meaning the southern side of a mountain, while the Chinese term ''nei menggu'' was retained. In recent years, some Mongols began to call Inner Mongolia ''Nan Menggu'' and with it came the change of English translation from Inner Mongolia to Southern Mongolia.<ref>Huhbator Borjigin. 2004. The history and political character of the name of 'Nei Menggu' (Inner Mongolia). Inner Asia 6: 61-80.</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of Mongolia}}
Much of what is known about the history of Greater Mongolia, including Inner Mongolia, is known through Chinese chronicles and historians. Before the rise of the Mongols in the 13th century, what is now central and western Inner Mongolia, especially the [[Hetao]] region, alternated in control between [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] agriculturalists in the south and [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], [[Khitan people|Khitan]], [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], [[Tujue]], and nomadic [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] of the north. The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese agriculturalists.

===Early History===
[[Slab Grave Culture|Slab Grave cultural]] monuments are found in northern, central and eastern [[Mongolia]], Inner Mongolia, north-western China, southern, central-eastern and southern [[Baikal Lake|Baikal]] territory. Mongolian scholars prove that this culture related to the Proto-Mongols.<ref>History of Mongolia, Volume I, 2003</ref>

During the [[Zhou Dynasty]], central and western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the [[Loufan (people)|Loufan]], Linhu, and [[Beidi|Dí]], while eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the [[Donghu people|Donghu]]. During the [[Warring States period]], [[King Wuling of Zhao|King Wuling]] (340–295 BC) of the [[state of Zhao]] based in what is now [[Hebei]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the [[Beidi|Dí]] [[state of Zhongshan]] in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and [[Loufan (people)|Loufan]] and created the [[Datong|commandery of Yunzhong]] near modern [[Hohhot]]. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After [[Qin Shihuang]] created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to [[Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu|drive the Xiongnu from the region]], and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin Dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: [[Commandery of Jiuyuan|Jiuyuan]] and Yunzhong, and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin Dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.<ref>Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian</ref>

During the [[Western Han Dynasty]], [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] sent the general [[Wei Qing]] to [[Han–Xiongnu War|reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu]] in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year he established the commanderies of [[commandery of Shuofang|Shuofang]] and [[commandery of Wuyuan|Wuyuan]] in Hetao. At the same time, what is now eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the [[Xianbei]], who would later on eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence.

During the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25–220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han Dynasty began to be settled in Hetao, and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on during the [[Western Jin Dynasty]], it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]], who established the [[Han Zhao]] kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes.

The [[Sui Dynasty]] (581–618) and [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) re-established a unified Chinese empire, and like their predecessors they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the [[Khitan Empire]] (Liao Dynasty), founded by the [[Khitans]], a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the [[Western Xia]] of the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]s, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including western Hetao) . The Khitans were later replaced by the [[Jurchens]], precursors to the modern [[Manchus]], who established the [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]] over Manchuria and northern China.

===Mongol Period===
{{Main|Mongol Empire|Post-Imperial Mongolia}}
[[File:Siège de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|left|[[Genghis Khan]] entering [[Beijing]].]]
[[File:Mongolia XVI.png|thumb|Mongol states, XIV-XVII : 1. [[Post-Imperial Mongolia|Mongolian Khaganate]] 2. [[Oirat Khanate]] 3. [[Moghulistan]] 4. [[Qara Del]]]]
After [[Genghis Khan]] unified the [[Mongol]] tribes in 1206 and founded the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Tanguts|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] empire was ultimately conquered in 1227, and the [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]] fell in 1234. In 1271, Genghis Khan's grandson [[Khubilai Khan|Khubilai]] established the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Khubilai's summer capital [[Shangdu]] (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day [[Duolun County|Dolonnor]]. During that time [[Ongud]] and [[Khunggirad]] peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan Dynasty was defeated by the Han-led [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1368, the Ming rebuilt the [[Great Wall of China]] at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the [[Tumu incident]] in 1449, when the Oirat ruler [[Esen taishi]] captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Northern Mongolia to Southern Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the [[Post-Imperial Mongolia]].<ref>CPAtwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.246</ref>

===Qing Period===
{{Main|Mongolia during the Manchu Qing rule}}
The eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the [[Khorchin]] and Southern [[Khalkha]] in today's Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes until [[Nurhaci]], the founder of the new Jin Dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.<ref>Atwood, Christopher. Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.449</ref> The [[Manchus]] gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when [[Ligden Khan]]'s son surrendered the [[Chahar Mongols|Chakhar]] Mongol tribes to the [[Manchus]]. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established [[Qing Dynasty]]. Under the Qing Dynasty (1636–1912), [[Mongolian plateau|Greater Mongolia]] was [[Mongolia during Qing rule|administered]] in a different way for each region:

* "Outer Mongolia": This region corresponds to the modern state of [[Mongolia]], plus the Russian-administered region of [[Tannu Uriankhai]], and a part of northern [[Xinjiang]]. It included the four leagues (''aimag'') of the [[Khalkha Mongols]] north of the [[Gobi desert|Gobi]], as well as the [[Tannu Uriankhai]] and [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] regions in northwestern Mongolia, which were overseen by the [[General of Uliastai]] from the city of [[Uliastai]].
* "Inner Mongolia": This region corresponded to most of modern Inner Mongolia and some neighbouring areas in [[Liaoning]] and [[Jilin]] provinces. The [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|banners]] and tribes in this region came under six [[Leagues of China|leagues]] (''chuulghan''): [[Tongliao|Jirim]], [[Juuuda]], [[Josutu]], [[Xilingol]], [[Ulanqab]], and [[Yekejuu]].
* "Taoxi Mongolia": The [[Alashan Öölüd]] and [[Ejine Torghuud]] banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia. This territory is equivalent to modern-day [[Alxa League]], the westernmost part of what is now Inner Mongolia.
* The Chahar [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|Banners]] were controlled by the military commander of Chahar (now [[Zhangjiakou]]). Their extent corresponded to southern Ulanqab and [[Bayannur]] in modern Inner Mongolia, plus the region around [[Zhangjiakou]] in [[Hebei]] province. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces also belonged to this region.
* The [[Guihua Tümed]] banner was controlled by the military commander of Suiyuan (now [[Hohhot]]). This corresponds to the vicinities of the modern city of [[Hohhot]]. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of modern [[Shanxi]] province also belonged to this region.
* The [[Hulunbuir]] region in what is now northeastern Inner Mongolia was part of the jurisdiction of the General of [[Heilongjiang]], one of the three generals of [[Manchuria]].

The Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] leader [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, 親王), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.

Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3985584|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3985584?seq=4|title=Land Use and Society in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia during the Qing Dynasty|last=Reardon-Anderson|first=James|date=Oct 2000|volume= 5|number=No. 4|journal=Environmental History|page=506|publisher=Forest History Society and American Society for Environmental History}}</ref>

Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of [[Han Chinese]] settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791 there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the [[Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County|Front Gorlos Banner]] that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalize the status of the peasants who had already settled there.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of China |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |volume=10 |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= |page=356 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

During the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicized, and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers. The [[Jindandao Incident]], a rebellion by an ethnic Chinese secret society called Jindandao occurred in Inner Mongolia in November 1891 and massacred 150,000 Mongols before being suppressed by government troops in late December.

===Republic of China period===
{{Further|Mongolia (1911–24)|Inner Mongolian People's Party}}
Outer Mongolia gained independence from the Qing Dynasty in 1911, when the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu of the Khalkha was declared the [[Bogd Khan]] of Mongolia. Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognized the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernizing objectives for Mongolia.<ref>Atwood, Christopher. The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.454</ref> Eventually, the newly formed [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] promised a new nation of five races ([[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Manchu]], [[Mongols in China|Mongol]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]),<ref>Atwood, Christopher. The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.91</ref> and suppressed the Mongol rebellions in the area,<ref>Belov, E.A. Anti-Chinese rebellion led by Babujav in Inner Mongolia, 1915-1916. - Annaly (Moscow), no. 2, 1996.</ref><ref>Belov, E.A. Rossiya i Mongoliya (1911–1919). Moscow: Vost. Lit.Publ.</ref> forcing the Inner Mongolian princes to recognize the Republic of China.

The Republic of China reorganized Inner Mongolia into provinces:
* [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the [[Chengde]] area in what is now northern [[Hebei]].
* [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]] province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.
* [[Suiyuan]] province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).
* Hulunbuir stayed within [[Heilongjiang]] in Manchuria, which had become a province.
* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of [[Liaoning|Fengtian]] in southern Manchuria.
* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e. Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring [[Gansu]] province. Later on [[Ningxia]] province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.

Some [[Republic of China]] maps still show this structure.

===Mengjiang period===
{{Main|Mengjiang}}
[[Mengjiang]] was an autonomous area of [[Reorganized National Government of China]], which was a puppet regime of Japan.

In  1931 Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state [[Manchukuo]], taking the Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e. Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were administered by Manchukuo until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945.

In 1937, open war broke out between the [[Republic of China]] and the [[Empire of Japan]]. On December 8, 1937, Mongolian Prince [[De Wang]] declared the independence of the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e. the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as [[Mengjiang|Mengkiang]] or Mengkukuo, and signed close agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. The capital was established at [[Zhangbei Town|Zhangbei]] (now in [[Hebei]] province), with the puppet government's control extending as far west as the [[Hohhot]] region. In August 1945, Mengkiang was taken by Soviet and Outer Mongolian troops during [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]]. Despite a considerable movement among Inner Mongolia's Mongols(who comprised then around 15% of Inner Mongolia's population, while Han Chinese around 83%) for unification with Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia remained part of China.

===Communist era===
{{npov-section|date=March 2015}}
The Communist movement gradually gained momentum as part of the Third Communist International in Inner Mongolia during the Japanese period. By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia, and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support, and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the [[People's Republic of China]] and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in [[Liaoning]] province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in [[Hebei]] province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, near all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was [[Ulanhu]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.<ref>David Sneath, "The Impact of the Cultural Revolution in China on the Mongolians of Inner Mongolia", in ''Modern Asian Studies'', Vol. 28, No. 2 (May, 1994), pp. 409-430</ref> In 1969 much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Jilin]], Jirim going to [[Jilin]], Juu Uda to [[Liaoning]], and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]]. This was reversed in 1979.

Inner Mongolia has seen considerable development since [[Deng Xiaoping]] instituted [[Chinese economic reform]] in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with [[Guangdong]]) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the [[Wolf Economy]] to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/19/world/asia/china-mongolians-culture/|title=Ethnic Mongolians in China concerned about cultural threat|author=Chi Chi Zhang, CNN|date=19 April 2012|work=CNN}}</ref> Attempts to attract [[ethnic Chinese]] to migrate from other regions, as well as ubranise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and  waste in public spending, such as [[Ordos City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1975397,00.html|title=Ordos, China: A Modern Ghost Town|work=TIME.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17390729|title=Ordos: The biggest ghost town in China|work=BBC News}}</ref> Acute uneven [[wealth distribution]] has further exacerbated etnhic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to [[2011 Inner Mongolia unrest|riots in 2011]] and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2012/04/18/atsr-china-inner-mongolian-culture-clash.cnn|title=Inner Mongolians culture clash|date=18 April 2012|work=CNN}}</ref><ref>http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/launches-09052013110502.html</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|thumb|Grasslands in the region]]
Officially Inner Mongolia is classified as one of the provincial-level divisions of [[North China]], but its great stretch means that parts of it belong to [[Northeast China]] and [[Northwest China]] as well. It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions ([[Heilongjiang]], [[Jilin]], [[Liaoning]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Ningxia]], and [[Gansu]]), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia, which, in Chinese, is sometimes called “Outer Mongolia” (外蒙古), while a small portion is with Russia.

[[File:昭君墓-青冢牌楼.JPG|thumb|Weeping willows (''Salix Babylonica'') grow tall at the [[Zhaojun Tomb]] in [[Hohhot]], reflecting the milder climate there.]]
Inner Mongolia largely consists of the northern side of the [[North China Craton]], a tilted and sedimented [[Precambrian]] block. In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region’s highest peak, [[Main Peak, Helan Mountains|Main Peak]] in the [[Helan Mountains]] reaches {{convert|3556|m|ft|-1}}, and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.<ref name="quaternary">Wei Zhang, Mingyue He, Yonghua Li, Zhijiu Cui, Zhilin Wang and Yang Yu; [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-012-5283-z?LI=true “Quaternary glacier development and the relationship between the climate change and tectonic uplift in the Helan Mountains”]; in ''Chinese Science Bulletin''; December 2012, Volume 57, Issue 34, pp 4491-4504</ref> Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}} in altitude and covered by extensive [[loess]] and [[sand]] deposits. The northern part consists of the [[Mesozoic]] era [[Khingan Mountains]], and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with [[Ulmus laciniata|Manchurian elm]], [[Ash (Fraxinus)|ash]], [[birch]], [[Quercus mongolica|Mongolian oak]] and a number of [[Pinus|pine]] and [[Picea|spruce]] species. Where [[discontinuous permafrost]] is present north of [[Hailar District]], forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.

Owing to the ancient, weathered rocks lying under its deep sedimentary cover, Inner Mongolia is a major mining district, possessing large reserves of [[coal]], [[iron ore]] and [[lanthanide|rare earth]] minerals, which have made it a major industrial region today.

===Climate===
Due to its elongated shape, Inner Mongolia has a wide variety of regional climates. Throughout the province, the climate is based off a four-season, [[monsoon]] climate. The winters in Inner Mongolia are very long, cold, and dry with frequent blizzards, though snowfall is so light that Inner Mongolia has no modern glaciers<ref name="quaternary"/> even on the highest Helan peaks. The spring is short, mild and arid, with large, dangerous [[sandstorms]], whilst the summer is very warm to hot and relatively humid except in the west where it remains dry. Autumn is brief and sees a steady cooling, with temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} reached in October in the north and November in the south.

Officially, most of Inner Mongolia is classified as either a [[cold arid]] or [[Steppe climate|steppe]] regime ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk, BSk'', respectively). The small portion besides these are classified as [[humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dwb'') in the northeast, or [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] (Köppen ''Dwc'') in the far north near [[Hulunbuir]].<ref>Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png "Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification"]. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 11: 1633-1644.</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia|List of township-level divisions of Inner Mongolia}}
Inner Mongolia is divided into twelve [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]]. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as ''[[Leagues of China|Leagues]]'' ({{zh|c=盟}}), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as ''Banners'' ({{zh|c=旗}}). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]], although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: [[Hailar District|Hailar]], [[Jining District|Jining]] and [[Dongsheng]]). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their [[primate city]] ([[Chifeng]], [[Tongliao]]), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself [[Ordos City|Ordos]]. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.

Many of the [[prefecture-level cities]] were converted very recently from [[Leagues of China|leagues]].

The twelve [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture-level divisions]] of Inner Mongolia are subdivided into 101 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including twenty-one [[District of China|district]]s, eleven [[county-level cities]], seventeen [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], forty-nine [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|banners]], and three [[autonomous banner]]s. Those are in turn divided into 1425 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]], including 532 [[town of China|town]]s, 407 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]s, 277 [[sumu (Inner Mongolia)|sumu]], eighteen [[ethnic township]]s, one [[ethnic sumu]], and 190 [[subdistrict]]s.

==Economy==
Farming of crops such as [[wheat]] takes precedence along the river valleys. In the more arid grasslands, herding of [[goat]]s, [[sheep]] and so on is a traditional method of subsistence. [[Forestry]] and [[hunting]] are somewhat important in the [[Greater Khingan]] ranges in the east. [[Reindeer]] herding is carried out by [[Evenks]] in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing [[grapes]] and [[winemaking]] have become an economic factor in the [[Wuhai]] area.
[[File:InnerMongolianTheater.jpg|right|thumb|Theater in [[Hohhot]]]]
Inner Mongolia has abundance of resources especially coal, [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], natural gas, [[rare earth element]]s, and has more deposits of naturally occurring [[niobium]], [[zirconium]] and [[beryllium]] than any other [[province]]-level region in China. However in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/inner-mongolia-autonomous-region/|title=China Economy @ China Perspective|work=thechinaperspective.com}}</ref> It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200512/27/eng20051227_231175.html|title=People's Daily Online  -- Inner Mongolia to double annual coal output by 2010|work=people.com.cn}}</ref>
[[File:InnerMengolianGym.jpg|right|thumb|Inner Mongolia Gymnasium]]
Industry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, [[power generation]], forestry-related industries, and related industries.
Inner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including [[dairy]]) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as [[ERDOS]], [[Yili Group|Yili]], and [[Mengniu]].

The nominal GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2010 was 1.16 trillion yuan (US$172.1 billion), a growth of 16.9% from 2008, with an average annual increase of 20% from the period 2003-2007. Its per capita GDP reached 37,287 yuan (US$5,460) in 2009. In 2008, Inner Mongolia's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 90.7 billion yuan, 427.1 billion yuan, and 258.4 billion yuan respectively. The urban per capita [[disposable income]] and rural per capita net income were 14,431 yuan and 4,656 yuan, up 16.6% and 17.8% respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200602/05/eng20060205_240396.html|title=People's Daily Online  -- Inner Mongolia's economy maintains a rapid growth momentum|work=people.com.cn}}</ref>

As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.

In addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China<ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/> thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up [[Wind power in China|wind parks]] in parts of Inner Mongolia such as [[Bail Miao|Bailingmiao]], Hutengliang and Zhouzi.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Inner Mongolia|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], articles 112-122, [[autonomous region]]s have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena.  Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. The current party secretary is [[Wang Jun (PRC politician)|Wang Jun]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/40664.htm|title=Who's Who in China's Leadership|work=china.org.cn}}</ref> The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased [[Chinese federalism|federalism]] characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Southern Mongols|Mongols in China|List of Chinese ethnic groups}}
[[File:Hohhot Muslim Quarter.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Muslim]]-themed Street in [[Hohhot]]]]

When the autonomous region was established in 1947, Han Chinese comprised 83.6% of the population, while the Mongols comprised 14.8% of the population.<ref>[[Myron Weiner]], Sharon Stanton Russell(2001). Demography and national security. page 276, table 9.4.</ref> By 2000, the percentage of Han Chinese had fallen to 79.2%. While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent episode of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the [[Qing Dynasty]], and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory ([[Hinggan League]], and prefectures [[Tongliao]] and [[Chifeng]]).

Mongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising  17.11% of the population. They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the [[Buryats]] and the [[Oirats]] are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. Many of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivized during the Maoist Era.

Other ethnic groups include the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Evenks]], the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], the [[Hui people|Hui]], the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s, and the [[Koreans in China|Koreans]].

The [[Han Chinese]] of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. The eastern parts tend to speak [[Northeastern Mandarin]], which belongs to the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the [[Huang He]] valley, speak varieties of [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the [[Shanxi]] province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the [[Zhangjiakou–Hohhot dialect]] which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as [[Hailar District|Hailar]].

[[Mongols]] in Inner Mongolia speak [[Mongolian language|Mongolian dialects]] such as [[Chakhar Mongolian|Chakhar]], Xilingol, [[Baarin Mongolian|Baarin]], [[Khorchin Mongolian|Khorchin]] and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects<ref>e.g. {{unicode|Sečenbaγatur, Qasgerel, Tuyaγ-a, B. ǰirannige, U Ying ǰe.}} 2005. ''{{unicode|Mongγul kelen-ü nutuγ-un ayalγun-u sinǰilel-ün uduridqal}}''. Kökeqota: ÖMAKQ.</ref> or closely related independent Central [[Mongolic languages]]<ref>e.g. [[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]]. 2006. Mongolic languages. In: Brown, K. (ed.): ''The encyclopedia of language & linguistics''. Amsterdam: Elsevier: 231-234.</ref> such as [[Ordos Mongolian|Ordos]], [[Khamnigan Mongol|Khamnigan]], Barghu [[Buryat language|Buryat]] and the arguably [[Oirat language|Oirat]] dialect [[Alasha dialect|Alasha]]. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the [[Plain Blue Banner, Inner Mongolia|Plain Blue Banner]], located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all [[Southern Mongolian|Southern Mongolian dialects]].<ref>{{unicode|Sečenbaγatur}} et al. 2005: 85</ref> This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related [[Khalkha]] dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in [[Hulunbuir]] such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language [[Daur language|Dagur]] and the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic language]] [[Evenki language|Evenki]]. Officially, even the Evenki dialect [[Oroqen language|Oroqin]] is considered a language.<ref>Janhunen, Juha. 1997. The languages of Manchuria in today’s China. In: Northern Minority languages: Problems of survival. ''Senri ethnological studies'', 44: 123-146. See pages 130-133</ref>

By law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual. Many ethnic Mongols, especially the young, speak fluent Chinese; Mongolian use is receding in urban areas. But rural ethnic Mongols have kept more of their traditions. In terms of written language, Inner Mongolia has retained the [[Mongolian script|classic Mongol written script]] as opposed to Mongolia's adoption of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

The vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasizes Mongolian nomadic traditions. The [[Mongols in China|Mongol]]s of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of [[dairy]]-related products and ''hand-held lamb'' (手扒肉). In recent years, franchises based on [[Hot pot]] have appeared Inner Mongolia, the best known of which is ''[[Xiaofeiyang]]'' (小肥羊). Notable Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include [[Mengniu]] and [[Yili Group|Yili]], both of which began as dairy product and [[ice cream]] producers.

Among the [[Han Chinese]] of Inner Mongolia, Jinju (晉劇) or [[Shanxi Opera]] is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: [[Shanxi]].

A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The internationally known Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus.

[[File:The White Sulde Temple.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Temple of the [[Sülde Tngri|White Sulde]] in the town of [[Uxin Banner|Uxin]], in the [[Ordos Desert|Mu Us Desert]].<ref group="nb">The White Sulde is one of the two spirits of [[Genghis Khan]] (the other being the Black Sulde), represented either as his white or yellow horse or as a fierce warrior riding this horse. In its interior, the temple enshrines a statue of Genghis Khan (at the center) and four of his men on each side (the total making nine, a symbolic number in Mongolian culture), there is an altar where offerings to the godly men are made, and three white suldes made with white horse hair. From the central sulde there are strings which hold tied light blue pieces of cloth with a few white ones. The wall is covered with all the names of the Mongol kins. No photos are allowed inside the temple.</ref>]]
{{Main|Religion in Inner Mongolia}}
According to researches conducted by the Religious Studies Department of Minzu University of China, adherents of the five officially recognised religions of the state ([[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Islam]]) constitute only 3.7% of the population of Inner Mongolia.<ref name="Yang-Lang">Fenggang Yang, Graeme Lang. ''Social Scientific Studies of Religion in China''. BRILL, 2012. ISBN 9004182462. pp. 184-185, reporting the results of surveys held in 2004 by the [[Minzu University of China]]. Quote from page 185: «[...] ''the registered adherents of the five official religions comprise only 3.7% of those [populations] in Inner Mongolia. When we compare this final statistic with Minzu University research team's finding that '''80% of the inhabitants of Inner Mongolia''' worship ''Tian'' (loosely translated "Heaven") and ''aobao'' (traditional stone structures that serve as altars for sacrifice), it is evident that the official calculations of registered religious believers are markedly low, and the policy decisions based on these numbers lack the necessary grounding in reality.'' [...] ''Foreign religions can be transformed into indigenous ethnic religions, and the traditional folk religions of China's ethnic minorities can integrate and neutralize non-native religions. Thus, China's ethnic religions should not be regarded as social burdens or challenges, but rather as valuable cultural assets.''»</ref>

At the same time, 80% of the inhabitants of the region declare to worship ''[[Tian]]'' and ''[[ovoo|aobao]]'', features of both [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Mongolian shamanism]].<ref name="Yang-Lang"/>

The [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Genghis Khan]], present in the form of various Genghis Khan temples, is a tradition of Mongolian shamanism, in which he is considered a [[cultural hero]] and divine ancestor, an embodiment of the ''[[Tengri|Tenger]]'' (Heaven, God of Heaven).<ref>John Man. ''Genghis Khan: Life, Death and Resurrection''. Bantam Press, London, 2004. ISBN 9780553814989. pp. 402-404</ref> His worship in special temples, greatly developed in Inner Mongolia since the 1980s, is also shared by the [[Han Chinese]], claiming his spirit as the founding principle of the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>John Man. ''Genghis Khan''. Bantam, 2005. ISBN 0553814982. p. 23</ref>

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolian Buddhism]]) is the dominant form of Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, also practiced by many [[Han Chinese]], and its influence may be far larger than what the official adherents statistics would testify. Another form of Buddhism, practiced by the Chinese, are the schools of [[Chinese Buddhism]].

==Chinese space program==
One of China's space vehicle launch facilities, [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] (JSLC) ({{zh|s=酒泉卫星发射中心}}), is located in the extreme west of Inner Mongolia, in the [[Alxa League]]'s [[Ejin Banner]]. It was founded in 1958, making it the PRC's first launch facility. More Chinese launches have occurred at Jiuquan than anywhere else. As with all Chinese launch facilities, it is remote and generally closed to the public. It is named as such since Jiuquan is the nearest urban center, although Jiuquan is in the nearby province of Gansu. Many space vehicles have also made their touchdowns in Inner Mongolia. For example, the crew of [[Shenzhou 6]] landed in [[Siziwang Banner]], near [[Hohhot]].
