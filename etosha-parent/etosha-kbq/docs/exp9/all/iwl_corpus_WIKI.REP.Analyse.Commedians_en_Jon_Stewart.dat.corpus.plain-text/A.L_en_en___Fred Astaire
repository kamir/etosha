His stage and subsequent film and television careers spanned a total of 76 years, during which he made 31 [[musical film]]s and several award-winning television specials and issued numerous recordings. He was named the fifth [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|Greatest Male Star of All Time]] by the [[American Film Institute]]. He is best known as the dancing partner and on-screen romantic interest of [[Ginger Rogers]], with whom he co-starred in a series of ten Hollywood musicals which transformed the genre.

[[Gene Kelly]], another major innovator in filmed dance, said that "the history of dance on film begins with Astaire." Beyond film and television, many noted dancers and choreographers, including [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins]], and [[Madhuri Dixit]], also acknowledged his importance and influence. Astaire ranks #5 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars]], a list of greatest screen legends in American film history.

After arriving in New York City at age 24 on October 26, 1892, and being inspected at [[Ellis Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org/search/passRecord.asp?pID=604917050856|title=The Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island|publisher=}}</ref> Astaire's father, hoping to find work in his brewing trade, moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and landed a job with the [[Storz Brewing Company]]. Astaire's mother dreamed of escaping Omaha by virtue of her children's talents, after Astaire's sister, [[Adele Astaire]], early on revealed herself to be an instinctive dancer and singer. She planned a "brother and sister act," which was common in [[vaudeville]] at the time. Although Astaire refused dance lessons at first, he easily mimicked his older sister's steps and took up piano, [[accordion]], and [[clarinet]].

When their father suddenly lost his job, the family moved to New York City in 1905 to launch the show business career of the children, who began training at the Alviene Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |last=Bentley |first=Toni |title=Two-Step: ‘The Astaires,’ by Kathleen Riley |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/the-astaires-by-kathleen-riley.html?_r=1&nl=books&emc=booksupdateema4_20120601&pagewanted=all |newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=June 3, 2012 |page=BR32}}</ref>

Despite Adele and Fred's teasing rivalry, they quickly acknowledged their individual strengths, his durability and her greater talent. Fred and Adele's mother suggested they change their name to "Astaire," as she felt "Austerlitz" sounded reminiscent of [[Battle of Austerlitz|the name of a battle]].  Family legend attributes the name to an uncle surnamed "L'Astaire."<ref>Thomas p. 17</ref>  They were taught dance, speaking, and singing in preparation for developing an act.  Their first act was called ''Juvenile Artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty''. Fred wore a top hat and tails in the first half and a lobster outfit in the second. In an interview, Astaire's daughter, Ava Astaire McKenzie, observed that they often put Fred in a top hat to make him look taller.<ref>''A Couple of Song and Dance Men'', 1975</ref> The goofy act debuted in [[Keyport, New Jersey]], in a "tryout theater." The local paper wrote, "the Astaires are the greatest child act in vaudeville."<ref>Bill Adler, ''Fred Astaire: A Wonderful Life'', Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1987, p. 13, ISBN 0-88184-376-8</ref>

As a result of their father's salesmanship, Fred and Adele rapidly landed a major contract and played the famed [[Orpheum Circuit]] in the Midwest, Western and some Southern cities in the United States. Soon Adele grew to at least three inches taller than Fred and the pair began to look incongruous. The family decided to take a two-year break from show business to let time take its course and to avoid trouble from the [[Gerry Society]] and the child labor laws of the time.  In 1912, Fred became an  [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]].<ref name="Astaire">{{cite book

Astaire's dancing was inspired by [[Bill Robinson|Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]] and [[John W.

By age 14, Fred had taken on the musical responsibilities for their act.<ref name="nyt"/> He first met [[George Gershwin]], who was working as a [[song plugger]] for [[Jerome H. Remick]]'s music publishing company, in 1916.<ref>Astaire p. 65: "We struck up a friendship at once. He was amused by my piano playing and often made me play for him."</ref> Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists. Astaire was always on the lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection. The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with ''Over the Top'', a patriotic revue. The Astaires performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time too.

===1917–1933: Stage career in Broadway and London===
[[File:AdeleFred1921.jpg|right|thumb|Fred and Adele Astaire in 1921]]
They followed up with several more shows, and of their work in "[[The Passing Show of 1918]]," [[Heywood Broun]] wrote: "In an evening in which there was an abundance of good dancing, Fred Astaire stood out&nbsp;... He and his partner, Adele Astaire, made the show pause early in the evening with a beautiful loose-limbed dance."<ref>Bill Adler, ''Fred Astaire: A Wonderful Life'', Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1987, p. 35, ISBN 0-88184-376-8</ref>

By this time, Astaire's dancing skill was beginning to outshine his sister's, though she still set the tone of their act and her sparkle and humor drew much of the attention, owing in part to Fred's careful preparation and strong supporting choreography.

During the 1920s, Fred and Adele appeared on Broadway and on the [[London]] stage in shows such as [[Jerome Kern]]'s [[The Bunch and Judy]] (1922), [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]'s ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]'' (1924), and ''[[Funny Face (musical)|Funny Face]]'' (1927) and later in ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]]'' (1931), winning popular acclaim with the theater crowd on both sides of the Atlantic. By then, Astaire's tap dancing was recognized as among the best, as [[Robert Benchley]] wrote in 1930, "I don't think that I will plunge the nation into war by stating that Fred is the greatest tap-dancer in the world."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|5}}

After the close of ''Funny Face'', the Astaires went to [[Hollywood]] for a screen test (now lost) at [[Paramount Pictures]] but were not considered suitable for films.

They split in 1932 when Adele married her first husband, [[Lord Charles Arthur Francis Cavendish]], a son of the [[Duke of Devonshire]]. Fred Astaire went on to achieve success on his own on Broadway and in London with ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'', while considering offers from Hollywood. The end of the partnership was traumatic for Astaire but stimulated him to expand his range. Free of the brother-sister constraints of the former pairing and with a new partner ([[Claire Luce]]), he created a romantic partnered dance to [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]," which had been written for ''The Gay Divorcee''. Luce stated that she had to encourage him to take a more romantic approach: "Come on, Fred, I'm not your sister, you know."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|6}} The success of the stage play was credited to this number and, when recreated in the film version of the play ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), it ushered in a new era in filmed dance.<ref name="Mueller">{{cite book

===1933–1939: Astaire and Rogers at RKO===
[[File:Flying Down to Rio Astaire and Rogers.jpg|thumb|Promotional photo with [[Ginger Rogers]]]]
According to Hollywood folklore, a screen test report on Astaire for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], now lost along with the test, is reported to have read: "Can't sing. Can't act. Balding. Can dance a little." The producer of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, [[Pandro S. Berman]], claimed he had never heard the story in the 1930s and that it only emerged years later.<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|7}} Astaire later insisted that the report had actually read: "Can't act. Slightly bald. ''Also dances''".<ref>Astaire made the comment in a 1980 interview on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' with [[Barbara Walters]].  Astaire was balding at the time he began his movie career and thus wore a toupee in all of his films.</ref> In any case, the test was clearly disappointing, and [[David&nbsp;O. Selznick]], who had signed Astaire to RKO and commissioned the test, stated in a memo, "I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|7}} However, this did not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending him for a few days to [[MGM]] in 1933 for his Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with [[Joan Crawford]] in the successful musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]''.

On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed [[Ginger Rogers]] in the 1933 [[Dolores del Río]] vehicle ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]''. In a review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:<blockquote>The main point of ''Flying Down to Rio'' is the screen promise of Fred Astaire&nbsp;...  He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains in a class by himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|7}}</blockquote>

Having already been linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was initially very reluctant to become part of another dance team. He wrote his agent, "I don't mind making another picture with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!' I've just managed to live down one partnership and I don't want to be bothered with any more."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|8}} He was persuaded by the obvious public appeal of the Astaire-Rogers pairing. The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood [[musical film|film musical]]. Astaire and Rogers made ten films together, including ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'', ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[Swing Time (1936 film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), and ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938). Six out of the nine Astaire-Rogers musicals became the biggest moneymakers for RKO; all of the films brought a certain prestige and artistry that all studios coveted at the time. Their partnership elevated them both to stardom; as [[Katharine Hepburn]] reportedly said, "He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal."<ref name="Croce">{{cite book

Astaire received a percentage of the films' profits, something extremely rare in actors' contracts at that time, and complete autonomy over how the dances would be presented, allowing him to revolutionize dance on film.<ref>The only other entertainer to receive this treatment at the time was [[Greta Garbo]].</ref>

Astaire is credited with two important innovations in early film musicals.<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|23,26}} First, he insisted that the (almost stationary) camera film a dance routine in a single shot, if possible, while holding the dancers in full view at all times. Astaire famously quipped: "Either the camera will dance, or I will."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|420}} Astaire maintained this policy from ''The Gay Divorcee'' (1934) onwards (until overruled by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who directed  ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968), Astaire's last film musical).<ref>Coppola also fired Hermes Pan from the film. cf. Mueller p. 403</ref> Astaire's style of dance sequences thus contrasted with the [[Busby Berkeley]] musicals, which were known for dance sequences filled with extravagant aerial shots, quick takes, and zooms on certain areas of the body, such as the arms or legs. Second, Astaire was adamant that all song and dance routines be seamlessly integrated into the plotlines of the film. Instead of using dance as spectacle as Busby Berkeley did, Astaire used it to move the plot along. Typically, an Astaire picture would include a solo performance by Astaire—which he termed his "sock solo"—a partnered comedy dance routine, and a partnered romantic dance routine.

Mueller sums up Rogers's abilities as follows: "Rogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began&nbsp;... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable." According to Astaire, "Ginger had never danced with a partner before ''Flying Down to Rio''. She faked it an awful lot. She couldn't tap and she couldn't do this and that&nbsp;... but Ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along. She got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong."<ref name="Satchell1">{{cite book |last=Satchell |first=Tim |date=1987 |title=Astaire: The Definitive Biography |publisher=Hutchinson |page=127 |isbn=9780091737368 |access-date= 2015}}</ref> In his book "Ginger: Salute to a Star" author Dick Richards quotes Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator of the New York Gallery of Modern Art, "Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and deserves most of the credit for our success."

For her part, Rogers described Astaire's uncompromising standards extending to the whole production, "Sometimes he'll think of a new line of dialogue or a new angle for the story&nbsp;... they never know what time of night he'll call up and start ranting enthusiastically about a fresh idea&nbsp;... No loafing on the job on an Astaire picture, and no cutting corners."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|16}}

Astaire was still unwilling to have his career tied exclusively to any partnership, however. He negotiated with RKO to strike out on his own with ''[[A Damsel in Distress (RKO)|A Damsel in Distress]]'' in 1937 with an inexperienced, non-dancing [[Joan Fontaine]], unsuccessfully as it turned out. He returned to make two more films with Rogers, ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle]]'' (1939). While both films earned respectable gross incomes, they both lost money because of increased production costs<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|410}} and Astaire left RKO, after being labeled "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]" by the ''Independent Film Journal''. Astaire was reunited with Rogers in 1949 at MGM for their final outing, ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'', the only one of their films together to be shot in [[Technicolor]].

===1940–1947: Drifting to an early retirement===
[[File:BroadwayMelody1940.JPG|thumb|With [[Eleanor Powell]] in ''Broadway Melody of 1940'']]
In 1939, Astaire left RKO to freelance and pursue new film opportunities, with mixed though generally successful outcomes. Throughout this period, Astaire continued to value the input of choreographic collaborators and, unlike the 1930s when he worked almost exclusively with Hermes Pan, he tapped the talents of other choreographers in an effort to continually innovate. His first post-Ginger dance partner was the redoubtable [[Eleanor Powell]]—considered the finest female tap-dancer of her generation—in ''[[Broadway Melody of 1940]]'' where they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Begin the Beguine]]." In his autobiography ''Steps in Time'', Astaire remarked, "She 'put 'em down like a man,' no ricky-ticky-sissy stuff with Ellie. She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself."

He played alongside [[Bing Crosby]] in ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942) and later ''[[Blue Skies (film)|Blue Skies]]'' (1946) but, in spite of the enormous financial success of both, was reportedly dissatisfied with roles where he lost the girl to Crosby. The former film is particularly remembered for his virtuoso solo dance to "Let's Say it with Firecrackers" while the latter film featured an innovative song and dance routine to a song indelibly associated with him: "[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]." Other partners during this period included [[Paulette Goddard]] in ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940), in which he dance-conducted the [[Artie Shaw]] orchestra.

[[File:Astaire-Hayworth-dancing.JPG|thumb|left|With [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''You Were Never Lovelier'' (1942)]]
He made two pictures with [[Rita Hayworth]], the daughter of his former vaudeville dance idols, the Cansinos. The first, ''[[You'll Never Get Rich]]'' (1941), catapulted Hayworth to stardom and provided Astaire his third on-screen opportunity to integrate Latin American dance idioms into his style (the first being with Ginger Rogers in "The Carioca" number from "Flying Down to Rio" (1933). The second, again with Rogers, was the "Dengozo" dance from "The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle" (1939)), taking advantage of Hayworth's professional Latin dance pedigree. His second film with Hayworth, ''[[You Were Never Lovelier]]'' (1942), was equally successful and featured a duet to Kern's "[[I'm Old Fashioned]]," which became the centerpiece of [[Jerome Robbins]]'s 1983 [[New York City Ballet]] tribute to Astaire. He next appeared opposite the seventeen-year-old [[Joan Leslie]] in the wartime drama ''[[The Sky's the Limit (1943 film)|The Sky's the Limit]]'' (1943), where he introduced [[Harold Arlen|Arlen]] and [[Johnny Mercer|Mercer]]'s "[[One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)|One for My Baby]]" while dancing on a bar counter in a dark and troubled routine. This film, which was choreographed by Astaire alone and achieved modest box office success, represented an important departure for Astaire from his usual charming happy-go-lucky screen persona and confused contemporary critics.

His next partner, [[Lucille Bremer]], was featured in two lavish vehicles, both directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]]: the fantasy ''[[Yolanda and the Thief]]'', which featured an avant-garde surrealistic ballet, and the musical revue ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946), which featured a memorable teaming of Astaire with [[Gene Kelly]] to "The Babbit and the Bromide," a Gershwin song Astaire had introduced with his sister Adele back in 1927. While ''Follies'' was a hit, ''Yolanda'' bombed at the box office and Astaire, ever insecure and believing his career was beginning to falter, surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of ''Blue Skies'' (1946), nominating "Puttin' on the Ritz" as his farewell dance.

After announcing his retirement in 1946, Astaire concentrated on his horse-racing interests and in 1947 founded the [[Fred Astaire Dance Studios]], which he subsequently sold in 1966.

===1948–1957: Productive years with MGM and second retirement===
[[File:Astaire, Fred - Daddy.jpg|thumb|In ''Daddy Long Legs'' (1955)]]
However, he soon returned to the big screen to replace the injured Kelly in ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948) opposite [[Judy Garland]], [[Ann Miller]], and [[Peter Lawford]] and for a final reunion with Rogers (replacing [[Judy Garland]]) in ''The Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals - one for M-G-M - ''[[Three Little Words (film)|Three Little Words]]'' with [[Vera-Ellen]] and [[Red Skelton]] and one on loan-out to Paramount - ''[[Let's Dance (1950 film)|Let's Dance]]'' with [[Betty Hutton]]. While ''Three Little Words'' did quite well at the box office, ''Let's Dance'' was a financial disappointment.  ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' (1951) with  [[Jane Powell]] proved to be very successful, but ''[[The Belle of New York]]'' (1952)  with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953), which is considered to be one of the finest musicals ever made, received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. But because of its excessive cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release. Soon after, Astaire, along with all the other remaining stars at M-G-M, was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, ''[[Daddy Long Legs (1955 film)|Daddy Long Legs]]'' (1955) with [[Leslie Caron]] at ''[[20th Century Fox]],'' when his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer. Astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, [[Johnny Mercer]] (the film's composer) and Fox studio executives convinced him that work would be the best thing for him at that time. When ''Daddy Long Legs'' was released in 1955, it did only moderately well at the box office. His next film for Paramount, ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957), teamed him with [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Kay Thompson]] and despite the sumptuousness of the production and the songs by the Gershwins, it failed to make back its cost. Similarly, Astaire's next project - his final musical at M-G-M,  ''[[Silk Stockings (film)|Silk Stockings]]'' (1957), in which he co-starred with [[Cyd Charisse]], also lost money at the box office. As a result, Astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years.

During 1952, Astaire recorded ''[[The Astaire Story]]'', a four-volume album with a quintet led by [[Oscar Peterson]]. The album, produced by [[Norman Granz]], provided a musical overview of Astaire's career. ''The Astaire Story'' later won the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in 1999, a special Grammy award to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and that have "qualitative or historical significance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame|title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame|work=The GRAMMYs}}</ref>

His legacy at this point was 30 musical films in 25 years. Afterwards, Astaire announced that he was retiring from dancing in film to concentrate on dramatic acting, scoring rave reviews for the nuclear war drama ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959).

===1957–1981: Branching out into televised dance and straight acting===
Astaire did not retire from dancing completely. He made a series of four highly rated [[Emmy Award]]-winning musical specials for television in 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1968, each featuring [[Barrie Chase]], with whom Astaire enjoyed an Indian summer of dance creativity. The first of these programs, 1958's ''[[An Evening with Fred Astaire]]'', won nine Emmy Awards, including "Best Single Performance by an Actor" and "Most Outstanding Single Program of the Year." It was also noteworthy for being the first major broadcast to be prerecorded on color videotape and has recently been restored. The restoration won a technical Emmy in 1988 for Ed Reitan, Don Kent, and Dan Einstein, who restored the original videotape, transferring its contents to a modern format and filling in gaps where the tape had deteriorated with kinescope footage. Astaire personally won the Emmy for Best Single Performance by an Actor but the choice had a controversial backlash because many felt that his dancing in the special was not the type of "acting" for which the award was designed. At one point Astaire even offered to return the award, but the Television Academy refused to consider it.<ref>"Emmys" by Thomas O'Neil; Perigee Trade; 3 edition 2000; pp. 61-62</ref>

Astaire played the role of Julian Osborne, a non-dancing acting role, in the 1959 movie ''On the Beach'' and was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor award for his performance, losing to [[Stephen Boyd]] in ''[[Ben Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]''. Astaire appeared in non-dancing roles in three additional films and several television series from 1957 to 1969.

Astaire's last major musical film was ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968), directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. He shed his white tie and tails to play an Irish rogue who believes if he buries a crock of gold in the shadows of [[Fort Knox]] it will multiply. His dance partner was [[Petula Clark]], who portrayed his skeptical daughter. He admitted to being as nervous about singing with her as she confessed to being apprehensive about dancing with him. Unfortunately, the film was a box-office failure, though it has gained a strong reputation over the years since its release.

Astaire continued to act into the 1970s, appearing on television as the father of [[Robert Wagner]]'s character of Alexander Mundy in ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' and in films such as ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974), in which he danced with [[Jennifer Jones]] and for which he received his only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. He voiced the mailman narrator in the 1970s animated television specials ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (TV special)|Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]'' and ''[[The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town]]''. He appeared in the first two ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' documentaries in the mid 1970s. In the second, aged seventy-six, he performed a number of very brief song-and-dance routines with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film. In the summer of 1975, he made three albums in London, ''[[Attitude Dancing (album)|Attitude Dancing]]'', ''[[They Can't Take These Away From Me]]'', and ''[[A Couple of Song and Dance Men]]'', the last an album of duets with [[Bing Crosby]]. In 1976, he played a supporting role as a dog owner in the cult movie ''[[The Amazing Dobermans]]'', co-starring [[Barbara Eden]] and [[James Franciscus]]. Fred Astaire played Dr. Seamus Scully in the [[France|French]] [[film]] ''[[The Purple Taxi]]'' (1977).

In 1978, he co-starred with [[Helen Hayes]] in a well received television film, ''A Family Upside Down,'' in which they played an elderly couple coping with failing health. Astaire won an Emmy Award for his performance. He made a well publicized guest appearance on the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' in 1979, as Chameleon, the possible father of [[Lieutenant Starbuck|Starbuck]], in "[[The Man with Nine Lives (Battlestar Galactica)|The Man with Nine Lives]]," a role written for him by [[Donald P. Bellisario]]. Astaire asked his agent to obtain a role for him on ''Galactica'' because of his grandchildren's interest in the series. This episode marked the final time that he danced on screen. His final film role was the 1981 adaptation of [[Peter Straub]]'s novel ''[[Ghost Story (film)|Ghost Story]].'' This horror film was also the last for two of his most prominent castmates, [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]]

==Working methods and influence on filmed dance==
{{Further|Fred Astaire's solo and partnered dances}}

[[File:Astaire - You're All the World to Me.jpg|left|thumb|Astaire dancing on the walls and ceiling for "You're All the World to Me"<ref>"You're All the World to Me" originated (with different lyrics) as "I Want to Be a Minstrel Man" in the [[Eddie Cantor]] musical ''[[Kid Millions]]'' (1934).</ref> from ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' (1951)]]
Astaire was a virtuoso dancer, able to convey light-hearted venturesomeness or deep emotion when called for. His technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing. Long after the photography for the solo dance number "I Want to Be a Dancin' Man" was completed for the 1952 feature ''[[The Belle of New York]]'', it was decided that Astaire's humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was reshot. The 1994 documentary ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]'' shows the two performances side-by-side in split screen. Frame for frame, the two performances are absolutely identical, down to the subtlest gesture.

Astaire's execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew from a variety of influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance, and the elevated style of [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the [[American Smooth]] style of [[ballroom dance]] and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach his "outlaw style," an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced. As [[Jerome Robbins]] stated, "Astaire's dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way he sets the steps on, over or against the music, is so surprising and inventive."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|18}} Astaire further observed:

{{quote|Working out the steps is a very complicated process—something like writing music. You have to think of some step that flows into the next one, and the whole dance must have an integrated pattern. If the dance is right, there shouldn't be a single superfluous movement. It should build to a climax and stop!<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|15}}}}

With very few exceptions, Astaire created his routines in collaboration with other choreographers, primarily [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]]. They would often start with a blank slate:

{{quote|For maybe a couple of days we wouldn't get anywhere—just stand in front of the mirror and fool around... Then suddenly I'd get an idea or one of them would get an idea... So then we'd get started... You might get practically the whole idea of the routine done that day, but then you'd work on it, edit it, scramble it, and so forth. It might take sometimes as long as two, three weeks to get something going.<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|15}}}}

Frequently, a dance sequence was built around two or three principal ideas, sometimes inspired by his own steps or by the music itself, suggesting a particular mood or action.<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|20}} Many of his dances were built around a "gimmick," such as dancing on the walls in "Royal Wedding" or dancing with his shadows in ''[[Swing Time]]'', that he or his collaborator had thought up earlier and saved for the right situation. They would spend weeks creating all the dance sequences in a secluded rehearsal space before filming would begin, working with a rehearsal pianist (often the composer [[Hal Borne]]) who in turn would communicate modifications to the musical orchestrators.

His perfectionism was legendary; however, his relentless insistence on rehearsals and retakes was a burden to some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As [[Vincente Minnelli]] stated, "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree of all the people in the world. He will not even go to see his rushes... He always thinks he is no good."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|16}} As Astaire himself observed, "I've never yet got anything 100% right. Still it's never as bad as I think it is."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|16}}

[[Michael Kidd]], who choreographed the 1953 film ''[[The Band Wagon]]'', found that his own concern about the emotional motivation behind the dance was not shared by Astaire. Kidd later recounted: "Technique was important to him. He'd say, 'Let's do the steps. Let's add the looks later.' "<ref name="Kisselgoff">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/movies/dance-view-for-michael-kidd-real-life-is-where-the-dance-begins.html| title=For Michael Kidd, Real Life Is Where The Dance Begins | work=New York Times | date=March 13, 1994 | accessdate=21 February 2014 | author=Kisselgoff, Anna | pages=H10}}</ref>

Although he viewed himself as an entertainer first and foremost, his consummate artistry won him the admiration of such twentieth century dance legends as [[Gene Kelly]], [[George Balanchine]], the [[Nicholas Brothers]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Margot Fonteyn]], [[Bob Fosse]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Bill Robinson]]. [[George Balanchine|Balanchine]] compared him to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], describing him as "[[q:Fred Astaire#Classical dancers and choreographers on Astaire|the most interesting, the most inventive, the most elegant dancer of our times]]," while for Baryshnikov he was "[[q:Fred Astaire#Classical dancers and choreographers on Astaire|a genius... a classical dancer like I never saw in my life]]."

==Influence on popular song==
{{Further|List of songs introduced by Fred Astaire}}
Extremely modest about his singing abilities (he frequently claimed that he could not sing,<ref>e.g. Satchell, p. 144</ref> but the critics rated him as among the finest), Astaire introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the [[Great American Songbook]], in particular, [[Cole Porter]]'s: "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" in ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1932), [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[Isn't This a Lovely Day?]]", "[[Cheek to Cheek]]" and "[[Top Hat, White Tie and Tails]]" in ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), "[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]" in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936) and "[[Change Partners]]" in ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938). He first presented [[Jerome Kern]]'s "[[The Way You Look Tonight]]" in ''[[Swing Time (1936 film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936); [[George Gershwin|the Gershwins']] "[[They Can't Take That Away From Me]]" in ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), "[[A Foggy Day]]" and "[[Nice Work If You Can Get It (song)|Nice Work if You Can Get it]]" in ''[[A Damsel in Distress (film)|A Damsel in Distress]]'' (1937); [[Johnny Mercer]]'s "[[One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)|One for My Baby]]" from ''[[The Sky's the Limit (1943 film)|The Sky's the Limit]]'' (1943) and "[[Something's Gotta Give (song)|Something's Gotta Give]]" from ''[[Daddy Long Legs (1955 film)|Daddy Long Legs]]'' (1955); and [[Harry Warren]] and [[Arthur Freed]]'s "This Heart of Mine" from ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946).

[[File:Astaire singing in Second Chorus.jpg|right|thumb|Astaire singing in ''[[Second Chorus]]'' (1940)]]
Astaire also co-introduced a number of song classics via song duets with his partners. For example, with his sister Adele, he co-introduced the Gershwins' "I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise" from ''Stop Flirting'' (1923), "[[Fascinating Rhythm]]" in ''Lady, Be Good'' (1924), "[[Funny Face (1927 song)|Funny Face]]" in ''Funny Face'' (1927); and, in duets with Ginger Rogers, he presented Irving Berlin's "[[I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket]]" in ''Follow the Fleet'' (1936), Jerome Kern's "[[Pick Yourself Up]]" and "[[A Fine Romance (song)|A Fine Romance]]" in ''[[Swing Time (1936 film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), along with The Gershwins' "[[Let's Call The Whole Thing Off]]" from ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937). With [[Judy Garland]], he sang Irving Berlin's "A Couple of Swells" from ''Easter Parade'' (1948); and, with [[Jack Buchanan]], [[Oscar Levant]], and [[Nanette Fabray]] he delivered [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]]'s "That's Entertainment" from ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953).

Although he possessed a light voice, he was admired for his lyricism, diction, and phrasing<ref>Thomas p. 118</ref>—the grace and elegance so prized in his dancing seemed to be reflected in his singing, a capacity for synthesis which led [[Burton Lane]] to describe him as "the world's greatest musical performer."<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|21}} Irving Berlin considered Astaire the equal of any male interpreter of his songs—"as good as [[Al Jolson|Jolson]], [[Bing Crosby|Crosby]] or [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]], not necessarily because of his voice, but for his conception of projecting a song."<ref name="en.wikiquote.org">[[q:Fred Astaire#Singers and songwriters on Astaire]]</ref> Jerome Kern considered him the supreme male interpreter of his  songs<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|21}} and Cole Porter and Johnny Mercer also admired his unique treatment of their work. And while George Gershwin was somewhat critical of Astaire's singing abilities, he wrote many of his most memorable songs for him.<ref name="Mueller"/>{{rp|123,128}} In his heyday, Astaire was referenced<ref name="en.wikiquote.org"/> in lyrics of songwriters Cole Porter, [[Lorenz Hart]] and [[Eric Maschwitz]] and continues to inspire modern songwriters.<ref>''e.g.'', the songs "I Am Fred Astaire" by [[Taking Back Sunday]], "No Myth" by [[Michael Penn]], "Take You on a Cruise" by [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], "Fred Astaire" by [[Lucky Boys Confusion]], "Long Tall Glasses" by [[Leo Sayer]], "[[Just Like Fred Astaire]]" by [[James (band)|James]], "After Hours" by "The Bluetones", "Fred Astaire" by Pips, Chips and Videoclips, "Decadence Dance" by Extreme, and appeared on the cover of [[The Beatles]]’ ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album.</ref>

Astaire was a songwriter of note himself, with "I'm Building Up to an Awful Letdown"  (written with lyricist [[Johnny Mercer]]) reaching number four in the Hit Parade of 1936.<ref>Billman, p. 287.</ref> He recorded his own "It's Just Like Taking Candy from a Baby" with [[Benny Goodman]] in 1940 and nurtured a lifelong ambition to be a successful popular song composer.<ref>Thomas, p. 135: "I'd love to have been able to do more with my music, but I never had the time. I was always working on dance numbers. Year after year I kept doing that. Somehow or other I always blame myself, because I say, 'Well, I could have found the time; why the hell didn't I do it?'"</ref>

==Personal life==
Politically, Astaire was a [[conservative]] and a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] supporter,<ref>Satchell, p.156</ref> though he never made his political views publicly known.<ref name= al.>Fred Astaire (Icons of America), Joseph Epstein, Yale University Press, 2008, pg. 75</ref> Along with [[Bing Crosby]], [[George Murphy]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and others, he was a charter (founding) member of the Hollywood Republican Committee.<ref>Billman, p.341</ref>  He was churchgoing, supportive of American military action, and dismissive of the increasing open sexuality in movies of the 1970s.<ref name= al. />

Always immaculately turned out, he and [[Cary Grant]] were called "the best dressed actor[s] in American movies".<ref name="schwarz20070102">{{cite news|last=Schwarz|first=Benjamin|title=Becoming Cary Grant |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/01/becoming-cary-grant/5548/ |accessdate=2011-01-18|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=January–February 2007}}</ref> Astaire remained a male fashion icon even into his later years, eschewing his trademark top hat, white tie, and tails (for which he never really cared)<ref>Astaire, Steps in Time, p. 8: "At the risk of disillusionment, I must admit that I don't like top hats, white ties and tails.</ref> in favor of a breezy casual style of tailored sports jackets, colored shirts, [[cravats]], and slacks—the latter usually held up by the idiosyncratic use of an old tie in place of a belt.

Astaire was married for the first time in 1933, to the 25-year-old Phyllis Potter (née Phyllis Livingston Baker; born 1908, died September 13, 1954), a [[Boston]]-born New York socialite and former wife of Eliphalet Nott Potter III (1906–1981), after pursuing her ardently for roughly two years, and despite the objections of his mother and sister.<ref name="nyt"/>  Phyllis's death from lung cancer, at the age of 46, ended 21 years of a blissful marriage and left Astaire devastated.<ref>Niven, David: ''Bring on the Empty Horses'', G. Putnam 1975, p. 248, 255: "The combination of Fred and Phyllis was a joy to behold&nbsp;... Theirs was the prototype of a gloriously happy marriage."</ref> Astaire attempted to drop out of the film ''[[Daddy Long Legs (1955 film)|Daddy Long Legs]]'' (1955), which he was in the process of filming, offering to pay the production costs to date, but was persuaded to stay.<ref>Billman, p. 22: "Astaire's intense professionalism—and the memory that Phyllis had wanted him to make the film—made him report back for work.  The first few weeks were difficult, with most of the time being spent on Leslie's ballets and requiring as little as possible from the grieving man. Caron remembered, "Fred used to sit down during a rehearsal and put his face in his towel and just cry."</ref>

In addition to Phyllis Potter's son, Eliphalet IV (known as Peter), the Astaires had two children. Fred, Jr. (born January 21, 1936), appeared with his father in the movie ''[[Midas Run]]'' but became a charter pilot and rancher instead of an actor. Their daughter Ava Astaire (born March 19, 1942; married Richard McKenzie) remains actively involved in promoting her late father's heritage.

His friend, [[David Niven]], described him as "a pixie—timid, always warm-hearted, with a penchant for schoolboy jokes." Astaire was a lifelong golf and [[Thoroughbred]] horse racing enthusiast. In 1946 his horse [[Triplicate]] won the prestigious [[Hollywood Gold Cup]] and [[San Juan Capistrano Handicap]]. He remained physically active well into his eighties. At age seventy-eight, he broke his left wrist while riding his grandson's skateboard.<ref>(Thomas p. 301) Astaire was awarded a life membership in the National Skateboard Society (Satchell p. 221). He remarked "Gene Kelly warned me not to be a damned fool, but I'd seen the things those kids got up to on television doing all sorts of tricks. What a routine I could have worked up for a film sequence if they had existed a few years ago. Anyway I was practicing in my driveway." (Satchell p. 221)</ref>

On June 24, 1980, he was married again, to Robyn Smith (born August 14, 1944), a jockey 45 years his junior, who rode for [[Alfred G. Vanderbilt II]] and was herself on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on July 31, 1972.

Astaire died from pneumonia on June 22, 1987, at the age of 88. Shortly before his death, Astaire said: "I didn't want to leave this world without knowing who my descendant was, thank you Michael" - referring to [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNP0ExKsp3UC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=I+didn%27t+want+to+leave+this+world+without+knowing+who+my+descendant+was,+thank+you+Michael&source=bl&ots=FR6ed4HrmQ&sig=dOtz2k9-JER5fHetqzw_UQt8cog&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QmlSVYrWDcbVoASGhYEY&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=I%20didn%27t%20want%20to%20leave%20this%20world%20without%20knowing%20who%20my%20descendant%20was%2C%20thank%20you%20Michael&f=false |title=Michael Jackson: The Golden Book of Condolence |author=Eugene, Michelle |publisher=Rose Dog Books |year=2011 |location=Pittsburgh |isbn=978-1-4349-8367-1 |page=41 |accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref> He was interred in the [[Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Chatsworth, California]].<ref>[[Ginger Rogers]], who died April 25, 1995, is interred in the same cemetery.</ref> One last request of his was to thank his fans for their years of support.

Astaire's life has never been portrayed on film.<ref>In 1986, [[Federico Fellini]] released ''[[Ginger and Fred]],'' which, although inspired by Astaire and Rogers, portrays an Italian ballroom dancing couple. In 1996, his widow allowed footage of him to be used in a commercial for [[Dirt Devil]] vacuum cleaners in which he dances with a vacuum. His daughter stated that she was "saddened that after his wonderful career he was sold to the devil." cf ''[[Royal Wedding]]''</ref>  He always refused permission for such portrayals, saying, "However much they offer me—and offers come in all the time—I shall not sell."<ref>Satchell p. 253</ref> Astaire's will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, "It is there because I have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be."<ref>Satchell p. 254. Billman (p. 26) believes Astaire couldn't countenance the portrayal of his first wife, who suffered from a [[speech impediment]].</ref>
