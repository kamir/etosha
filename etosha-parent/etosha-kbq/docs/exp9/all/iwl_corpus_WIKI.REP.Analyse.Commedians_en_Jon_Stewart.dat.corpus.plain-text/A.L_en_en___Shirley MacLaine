'''Shirley MacLean Beaty'''<!-- spelling of Beaty here is correct --> (born April 24, 1934), known professionally as '''Shirley MacLaine''', is an American film, television and theater actress, singer, dancer, activist and author.  She has won one [[Academy Award]], five [[Golden Globe Awards]], including the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]], one [[Emmy Award]] and two [[BAFTA Awards]].

In 2012, she received the 40th [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] from the [[American Film Institute]], and in 2013 received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] for lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts.  She is known for her [[New Age]] beliefs and interest in spirituality and [[reincarnation]].  She has written a series of [[autobiography|autobiographical work]]s, many dealing with her spiritual beliefs as well as her [[Hollywood]] career.

==Early life==
Named after [[Shirley Temple]] (who was 6 years old at the time), Shirley MacLean Beaty<!-- spelling of Beaty here is correct --> was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Her father, Ira Owens Beaty,<!-- spelling of Beaty here is correct --><ref>[http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_gbr83.asp New England Historic Genealogical Society]</ref> was a professor of psychology, public school administrator, and real estate agent, and her mother, Kathlyn Corinne ([[married and maiden names|née]] MacLean), was a drama teacher, originally from [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia]], Canada. Shirley's younger brother is the actor, writer and director [[Warren Beatty]]; he changed the spelling of his surname when he became an actor.<ref name="60mins">{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/shirley-maclaines-recent-lives/|title=Shirley MacLaine's Recent Lives|last=Kohn|first=David|author2=Mike Wallace |date=May 16, 2000|work=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate= January 4, 2014}}</ref> Their parents raised them as [[Baptist beliefs|Baptists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Warren_Beatty.html |title=The religion of Warren Beatty, actor, director|publisher=Adherents.com|date= August 30, 2005|accessdate= March 6, 2010}}</ref> Her uncle (her mother's brother-in-law) was [[A.

Shirley played baseball on an all-boys team, holding the record for most home runs which earned her the nickname "Powerhouse".  During the 1950s, the family resided in the [[Dominion Hills Historic District|Dominion Hills]] section of Arlington.<ref name=VAnom>{{cite web|url= http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/ons/hp/file84027.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Dominion Hills Historic District|author=Laura Trieschmann, Paul Weishar, and Anna Stillner|date= May 2011}}</ref>

She had weak ankles as a toddler, so her mother decided to enroll her in ballet class at the age of three.<ref name="Denis1980">{{cite book|last=Denis|first=Christopher |title=The films of Shirley MacLaine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PwEvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=April 11, 2011|year=1980|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=978-0-8065-0693-7|page=14}}</ref> This was the beginning of her interest in performing. Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]''; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but proceeded to dance the role all the way through. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique. She explained that she didn't have the ideal body type, lacking the requisite "beautifully constructed feet" of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle.<ref name="MacLaine1996">{{cite book|last=MacLaine|first=Shirley| title=My Lucky Stars: A Hollywood Memoir |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kSKjB8WWKoIC |accessdate=April 11, 2011|date=November 1, 1996|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-553-57233-9}}</ref> Also slowly realising ballet's propensity to be too all-consuming, and ultimately limiting, she moved on to other forms of dancing, acting and musical theatre.

She attended [[Washington-Lee High School]], where she was on the cheerleading squad and acted in school theatrical productions. The summer before her senior year, she came to New York City to try acting on Broadway, and had some success. After she graduated, she returned and within a year became an understudy to actress [[Carol Haney]] in ''[[The Pajama Game]]''; Haney broke her ankle, and Shirley replaced her. A few months after, with Haney still injured, film producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] saw Shirley's performance, and signed her to work for [[Paramount Pictures]]. She later sued Wallis over a contractual dispute, a suit that has been credited with ending the old-style studio [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] of actor management.<ref>''Hanrihan v. Parker'', 19 Misc. 2d 467, 469 (N.Y. Misc. 1959).</ref>

==Career==
[[Image:Shirley MacLaine in The Trouble With Harry trailer.jpg|thumb|left|MacLaine in her debut film ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955)]]
MacLaine made her film debut in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), for which she won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]]. Quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film "[[Artists and Models]]" (1955). In 1956, she had roles in ''[[Hot Spell (film)|Hot Spell]]'' and ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. At the same time she starred in ''[[Some Came Running (1958 film)|Some Came Running]]'', the film in which she garnered her first Academy Award nomination – one of five that the film received – and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for ''[[The Apartment]]'', starring with [[Jack Lemmon]]. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for [[Billy Wilder]]. She later said, "I thought I would win for ''The Apartment'', but then [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had a tracheotomy." She starred in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961) also starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[James Garner]], based on the play by [[Lillian Hellman]] and directed by [[William Wyler]]. She was again nominated, this time for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon. [[Don Siegel]], her director on ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970) said of her: "It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine and has too much balls. She's very, very hard."<ref>Patrick McGilligan, ''Clint: The Life and Legend'' (1999), p. 182</ref>

[[File:Shirley MacLaine - 1976.jpg|thumb|in "Shirley MacLaine - Live at the Palace Theatre," 1976]]
In 1975, she received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] for her documentary film ''[[The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir]]''. Two years later, she was once again nominated for an Oscar for ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' co-starring [[Anne Bancroft]], in which she portrayed a retired ballerina much like herself. In 1978, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.<ref>http://wif.org/past-recipients</ref> In 1980, she starred in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' alongside [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The pair famously didn't get along, with Hopkins saying of MacLaine: "[S]he was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with."<ref name="Films and filming">{{cite book|title=Films and filming|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0kEbAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 June 2011|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Hansom Books}}</ref> In 1983, she won an Oscar for ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', playing [[Debra Winger]]'s mother. The film won another four Oscars; one for [[Jack Nicholson]] and three for director-screenwriter-producer [[James L. Brooks]]. In 1988, MacLaine won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe for Best Actress (Drama)]] for ''[[Madame Sousatzka]]''.

She continued to star in major films, such as ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' with [[Julia Roberts]] and other stars. In 2000 she made her feature-film directorial debut and starred in ''[[Bruno (2000 film)|Bruno]]'', which was released to video as ''[[The Dress Code]].''  Other notable films in which MacLaine has starred include ''[[Sweet Charity]]'' (1968); ''[[Being There]]'' (1979) with [[Peter Sellers]]; ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]'' (1990) with [[Meryl Streep]], playing a fictionalized version of [[Debbie Reynolds]] with a screenplay by Reynolds's daughter, [[Carrie Fisher]]; ''[[Used People]]'' (1992) with [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Kathy Bates]]; ''[[Guarding Tess]]'' (1994) with [[Nicolas Cage]]; ''[[Mrs. Winterbourne]]'' (1996), with [[Ricki Lake]] and  [[Brendan Fraser]]; ''[[Rumor Has It…]]'' (2005) with [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]]; ''[[In Her Shoes (2005 film)|In Her Shoes]]'' with [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Toni Collette]]; and ''[[Closing the Ring]]'' (2007) directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] and starring [[Christopher Plummer]].

MacLaine has also appeared in numerous television projects including an autobiographical miniseries based upon the book ''[[Out on a Limb (book)|Out on a Limb]]''; ''The Salem Witch Trials''; ''[[These Old Broads]]'' written by [[Carrie Fisher]] and co-starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], and [[Joan Collins]]; and ''Coco'', a [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] production based on the life of [[Coco Chanel]]. She had a short-lived television sitcom called ''[[Shirley's World]]''. She appeared in the third and fourth seasons of the British drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' as [[List of Downton Abbey characters#Martha Levinson|Martha Levinson]], mother to Cora, Countess of Grantham (played by [[Elizabeth McGovern]]) and Harold Levinson (played by [[Paul Giamatti]]) in 2012&ndash;2013.<ref name=hollywoodreporter>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/downton-abbey-shirley-maclaine-elizabeth-mcgovern-285812|title='Downton Abbey' Adds Shirley MacLaine for Season 3|date=January 30, 2012|accessdate=January 31, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Michael|last=O'Connell}}</ref><ref name=nytimes>{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/shirley-maclaine-will-return-to-downton-abbey-but-others-are-leaving-the-series/?_r=0|title=Shirley MacLaine to Return to 'Downton Abbey,' but Others Are Leaving the Series|date=March 3, 2013|accessdate=January 1, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff}}</ref>

MacLaine was married to businessman Steve Parker from 1954 until their divorce in 1982; they have a daughter, [[Sachi Parker|Sachi]]. In April 2011, while promoting her new book, ''I'm Over All That'', she revealed to [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she had an [[open relationship]] with her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestsyndication.com/?q=20110411_shirley_maclaine_oprah_interview_new_book_i_am_all_over_that_ufo_2012_end_of_the_world.htm| title=Shirley MacLaine interviewed on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show{{'-}}| publisher=BestSyndication.com |date= April 11, 2011}}</ref>  MacLaine also told Winfrey that she often fell for the leading men she worked with, with the exceptions of [[Jack Lemmon]] (''[[The Apartment]]'') and [[Jack Nicholson]] (''[[Terms of Endearment]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Shirley MacLaine admits she slept with three people in one day|date=13 April 2011|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8447194/Shirley-MacLaine-admits-she-slept-with-three-people-in-one-day.html|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>

MacLaine has claimed that, in a previous life in [[Atlantis]], she was the brother to a 35,000 year old spirit named Ramtha channeled by American mystic teacher and author [[J. Z. Knight]].<ref name="Ramtha 1">{{cite book|last=Farha|first=Bryan|title=A Critical Analysis; Paranormal Claims|year=2007|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-7618-3772-5|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tzEdpR4gizsC&pg=PA2&dq=shirley+maclaine+ramtha&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZhbHUt-CLJfCoASo3IDgCQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=shirley%20maclaine%20ramtha&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Ramtha 2">{{cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George D.|title=The A to Z of New Religious Movements|year=2001|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8108-5588-5|page=191|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Hq988pEebSAC&pg=PA191&dq=shirley+maclaine+ramtha&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZhbHUt-CLJfCoASo3IDgCQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=shirley%20maclaine%20ramtha&f=false}}</ref>

She has a strong interest in spirituality and [[metaphysics]], the central theme of some of her best-selling books including ''[[Out on a Limb (book)|Out on a Limb]]'' and ''[[Dancing in the Light]]''. She has undertaken such forms of spiritual exploration as walking the [[Way of St. James]], working with [[Chris Griscom]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Haederle|first=Michael|title=School Founder Listened to That Little Voice|date=6 February 1992|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-06/news/vw-1977_1_summer-school|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> and practicing [[Transcendental Meditation]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-maharishi6feb06,1,1158944.story |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|date= February 6, 2008 |accessdate= March 6, 2010}}</ref>

Her well-known interest in [[New Age]] spirituality has also made its way into several of her films. In [[Albert Brooks]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991), the recently deceased lead characters, played by Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]], are astonished to find MacLaine introducing their past lives in the "Past Lives Pavilion". In ''[[Postcards from the Edge]]'' (1990), MacLaine sings a version of "I'm Still Here", with customized lyrics created for her by composer [[Stephen Sondheim]]. One of the lyrics was changed to "I'm feeling transcendental – am I here?" In the television movie ''[[These Old Broads]]'', MacLaine's character is a devotee of New Age spirituality.

She has an interest in [[UFOs]], and gave numerous interviews on [[CNN]], [[NBC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] news channels on the subject during 2007–2008. In her book ''Sage-ing While Age-ing'' (2007), she described alien encounters and witnessing of Washington DC UFO incidents in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/21655677/ns/today-books/t/shirley-maclaine-older-much-wiser|title=NBC, Today show: Shirley MacLaine: Older and much wiser|publisher=today.msnbc.msn.com|date= November 7, 2007}}</ref> In the April 2011 edition of the [[Oprah show]] MacLaine stated that she and her neighbor observed numerous UFO incidents at her New Mexico ranch for extended periods of time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Hollywood-Legend-Shirley-MacLaine/7|title=Hollywood Legend Shirley MacLaine| publisher= oprah.com| date= April 11, 2011}}</ref>

Along with her brother, Warren Beatty, MacLaine used her celebrity status in instrumental roles as a [[Celebrity activists in George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign|fundraiser and organizer]] for [[George McGovern]]'s [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|campaign for president in 1972]].<ref name="MacLaine, Shirley 1972">MacLaine, Shirley, ''McGovern: The Man and His Beliefs'', New York: [[W.
