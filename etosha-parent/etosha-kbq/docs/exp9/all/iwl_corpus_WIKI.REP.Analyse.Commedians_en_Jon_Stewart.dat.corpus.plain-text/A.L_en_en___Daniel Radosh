'''Daniel Radosh''' (born 23 March 1969) is an [[United States|American]] journalist and [[blog]]ger. Radosh is a [[staff writer]] for ''[[The Daily Show]] with [[Jon Stewart]]''. He was previously a contributing editor at ''[[The Week]].'' He writes occasionally for ''[[The New Yorker]]''. His writing has also appeared in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|McSweeney's Quarterly Concern]]'', ''[[Might magazine|Might]]'', ''[[New York Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Radar]]'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', and other publications. From 2000 to 2001, he was a senior editor for ''[[Modern Humorist]]''. In the 1990s he was a writer and editor at ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]''. Radosh began his writing career at [[Youth Communication]] in 1985, where as a high school student he published more than a dozen stories in ''New Youth Connections'' (now ''YCteen''), a magazine by and for New York City teens.<ref>http://youthcomm.org/who_we_are/alumni/alumni_R-S.html#R</ref>

His blog, Radosh.net, was named one of the "top 25 blogs" by Time.com in 2008.<ref name="Time.com's First Annual Blog Index">"[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1725323_1725329_1725404,00.html/ Time.com's First Annual Blog Index ]," ''Time.com'', 2007</ref> As a blogger, he is probably best known for his public dispute with journalist [[Peter Landesman]], who wrote an article about [[sexual slavery]] in the Jan. 25 2004 issue of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' titled "The Girls Next Door." When Radosh challenged the facts of the article, Landesman threatened legal action against Radosh. A series of articles about the dispute by [[Jack Shafer]] in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' turned the issue of the article's accuracy — and of the legal rights and responsibilities of blogs — into one of the most controversial topics in journalism during the first half of 2004.<ref>"[http://www.slate.com/id/2094646/fr/nyt/ Assessing Landsman]," ''Slate'', June 9, 2005</ref>

Much of Radosh's journalism is on lighter topics, however: the description for his blog is "Pop. Politics. Sex. So On." In pop-culture circles, Radosh is known for his obsession with tracing [[Huckapoo]]'s attempts to infiltrate popular consciousness. He also runs on his blog the New Yorker Cartoon Anti-Caption Contest, a spoof of the New Yorker's weekly cartoon caption contest.<ref name="Time.com's First Annual Blog Index" />

His first book, ''Rapture Ready! Adventures in the Parallel Universe of Christian Pop Culture'', was published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 2008.

Radosh is the son of historian [[Ronald Radosh]]. He graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1991, and currently resides in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]].
