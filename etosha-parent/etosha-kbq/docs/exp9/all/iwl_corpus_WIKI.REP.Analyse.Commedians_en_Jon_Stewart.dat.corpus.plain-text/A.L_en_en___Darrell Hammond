In the late 1980s, Hammond worked briefly as a stand-up comedian on Premier Cruise Line ships.<ref name="ll97">llarchive.com page for ''[[Loveline]]'' episode: "[http://files.llarchive.com/1997/Loveline%20-%201997-1x-xx%20(Guest%20-%20Darrell%20Hammond).mp3 1997-1x-xx, Guest - Darrell Hammond]."</ref><ref name="ll00">llarchive.com page for ''[[Loveline]]'' episode: "[http://files.llarchive.com/2000/Loveline%20-%202000-05-31%20(Guest%20-%20Darrell%20Hammond).mp3 2000-05-31, Guest - Darrell Hammond]."</ref>

One evening, while the boat was docked in [[the Bahamas]], Hammond visited a restaurant, where he consumed the equivalent of 16 shots of [[rum]].<ref name="ll04">mediafire.com page for ''[[Loveline]]'' episode: "[http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?joojon4ynmw 2004-06-07, Guest - Darrell Hammond]."</ref> He claimed that a man repeatedly pestered him throughout the evening to take a dollar bill with trace amounts of [[cocaine]] on it.<ref name="ll97" /> When the comedian left the bar to use the restroom, the man followed him into the stall and told him, "I think you should take this with you."<ref name="ll97" /> Believing he was about to be [[Robbery|mugged]], he relented, and the man placed the bill inside Hammond's pocket.<ref name="ll97" /> Local [[police]] were waiting outside the restroom and quickly arrested him. The United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] later told Hammond that the episode had been a setup, and that local authorities regularly entrapped American tourists;<ref name="ll97" /> he spent a weekend in a crude jail cell. Hammond was released after his father traveled to the Bahamas and paid $5,000 for his son's release.<ref name="ll97" />
