The writers, especially Green, also provide many of the voices. Senreich, Goldstein, and Root were formerly writers for the popular [[action figure]] hobbyist magazine ''[[ToyFare]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://actionfigures.about.com/b/2011/01/26/r-i-p-toyfare-magazine-1997-2011.htm |title=R.I.P.

==Background==
''Robot Chicken'' is based on "[[Twisted ToyFare Theater]]", a humorous photo [[comic-strip]] appearing in ''[[ToyFare|ToyFare: The Toy Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2012/09/09/before-robot-chicken-twisted-toyfare-theatre-takes-on-dc-comics/ |title=Before Robot Chicken: Twisted ToyFare Theatre Takes on DC Comics |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref> It is a [[sketch comedy]] that [[Parody|parodies]] a number of [[Popular culture|pop culture]] conventions using [[stop motion]] animation of [[toy]]s, [[action figure]]s, [[Clay animation|claymation]], and various other objects, such as tongue depressors, [[The Game of Life]] pegs, and popsicle sticks during a joke about a loss of budget.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/episodes/3902/Robot_Chicken_Constantine_Dark_Tip.html |title=Video Games, Game Reviews & News |publisher=G4tv.com |date=2005-02-16 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref> The show's name was inspired by a dish on the menu at a [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] restaurant, Kung Pao Bistro, where Green and Senreich had dined; the series originally was intended to be called ''[[Junk in the Trunk]]''.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The series first appeared as ''Sweet J Presents'' on the [[Sony]] website Screenblast.com in 2001.<ref name="nytimes2006">[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/arts/television/17itzk.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0 The New York Times]</ref> The show was created, written, and produced by Green and Senreich. ''Sweet J Presents'' ended after 12 episodes and moved to [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] in 2005 as ''Robot Chicken''. In the first episode ("Conan's Big Fun"), [[Conan O'Brien]] was a featured character, voiced by ''[[Family Guy]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] (2005–present).<ref name="tvcom1">[http://www.tv.com/robot-chicken/sweet-j-presents/episode/751164/summary.html Robot Chicken: Sweet J Presents (Summary)]</ref>

''Robot Chicken'' premiered on Sunday, February 20, 2005.<ref name="nytimes2006"/> It is produced by Stoopid Buddy Stoodios ([[ShadowMachine Films]] Seasons 1-5) in association with [[Stoop!d Monkey]], [[Williams Street]], [[Sony Pictures Digital]], and [[Sony Pictures Television]].<ref name="nytimes2006"/> It also airs in the United Kingdom and Ireland as part of [[Fox (UK and Ireland)|FX]]'s [[Adult Swim UK|Adult Swim]] block, in Canada on [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]]'s [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)#The Detour on Teletoon and F-Night|TELETOON at Night]] block, in [[Australia]] on [[The Comedy Channel]]'s Adult Swim block, in Russia on 2x2's Adult Swim block, in Germany on TNT Series' Adult Swim block, and in [[Latin America]] on the [[I.Sat]] Adult Swim block (after the Adult Swim block was cancelled from [[Cartoon Network (Latin America)|Cartoon Network]] Latin America in 2008). The show is rated TV-14 and TV-MA, and many of the sketches from ''Sweet J Presents'' were redone for ''Robot Chicken''.<ref name="nytimes2006"/>

The series was renewed for a 20-episode third season, which ran from August 1, 2007, to September 28, 2008.<ref name="nytimes2006"/> After an eight month hiatus during the third season, the show returned on August 31, 2008, to air the remaining 5 episodes.<ref name="nytimes2006"/> The series was renewed for a fourth season which premiered on December 7, 2008, and ended September 20, 2009.<ref name="nytimes2006"/> In early 2010, the show was renewed for a fifth and sixth season (40 more episodes total).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/21/robot-chicken-gets-unprecedented-two-season-40-episode-pick-up/39625 |title=Robot Chicken Gets Unprecedented Two-Season, 40 Episode Pick-Up - TV Ratings, Nielsen Ratings, Television Show Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> Season 5 premiered on December 12, 2010.<ref name="nytimes2006"/> The second group of episodes began broadcasting on October 23, 2011.

==Opening sequence==
{{original research|section|date=September 2013}}
On a stormy night, a [[mad scientist]] finds a [[roadkill|road-killed]] [[chicken]], which he takes back to his laboratory to re-fashion into a [[cyborg]]. Midway through the opening sequence, the titular chicken turns his laser eye towards the camera, and the title appears amidst the "laser effects" as [[Les Claypool]] of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] can be heard screaming "It's alive!" ''à la'' ''[[Frankenstein]]''. Claypool also composed and performed the show's theme song. The mad scientist then straps the re-animated Robot Chicken into a chair, uses [[calipers]] to hold his eyes open, and forces him to watch a bank of television monitors (an allusion to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''); this scene [[segue]]s into the body of the show, which resembles someone frequently changing TV channels.

In the episode "[[1987 (Robot Chicken episode)|1987]]", [[Michael Ian Black]] claims that this sequence tells the viewer that they (the audience) are the robot chicken(s), being forced to watch the skits. As a result, the show does not actually focus on the robot chicken until the 100th episode when he finally makes his escape and later kills the mad scientist when he kidnaps a hen who is the chicken's girlfriend.

Beginning in the sixth season, a new opening sequence has been featured with a role reversal. The chicken comes upon the body of the scientist, which has been decapitated. He decides to do to the scientist what the scientist did to him: add robotic parts to him, turn him into a cyborg, and give him a laser eye (although he gives the scientist a blue eye instead of a red one, which necessitates a change in the title's background color), then strap him to the same chair he was strapped to and force him to watch the same TV monitors while the chicken and his girlfriend share a kiss.<ref name="adultswim1">{{cite web|url=http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/robot-chicken-opening.html |title=Robot Chicken Opening - Robot Chicken - Adult Swim Video |publisher=Video.adultswim.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref>

==Overview==
The show mocks popular culture, referencing [[toy]]s, [[Film|movie]]s, [[television]], [[game]]s, popular fads, and more obscure references like anime cartoons and older television programs, much in the same vein as comedy sketch shows like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name="askmeninterview">{{cite web | url=http://ie.askmen.com/celebs/interview_300/328_seth-green-interview.html| title= Seth Green Interview | publisher= askmen.com| accessdate= 2013-05-02}}</ref> One particular motif involves the idea of fantastical characters being placed in a more realistic world or situation (such as [[Stretch Armstrong]] requiring a corn syrup transplant after losing his abilities because of aging, [[Optimus Prime]] performing a prostate cancer [[Public service announcement|PSA]] for the humans, and [[Godzilla]] having problems in the bedroom).<ref name="askmeninterview"/> The program even had a 30-minute episode dedicated to ''[[Star Wars]]'' which premiered June 17, 2007, in the US featuring the voices of ''Star Wars'' notables [[George Lucas]], [[Mark Hamill]] (from a [[Vegetable Funfest (Robot Chicken episode)|previous episode]]), [[Billy Dee Williams]], and [[Ahmed Best]].<ref name=usa>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-06-12-robot-chicken_N.htm|title='Robot Chicken' digs its satirical talons into 'Star Wars'|accessdate=2008-11-02|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Mike Snider|date=June 13, 2007}}</ref> The ''Star Wars'' episode was nominated for a 2008 [[Emmy]] Award as Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour).

==Recurring sketches==
{{refimprove|date=June 2014}}
The show features several recurring sketches. Some of the more predominant ones include:

* '''Bloopers''' - A parody of the [[Bob Saget]]-era of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', featuring a host with exaggerated spastic mannerisms who commits [[suicide]] at the end of each show.

* '''The Nerd''' - The Nerd is an awkward middle school student with broken glasses who lisps.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|last=Seijas |first=Casey |url=http://www.ugo.com/the-goods/robot-chicken-san-diego-comic-con-exclusive-figure-revealed |title=Robot Chicken SDCC 2010 Exclusive 'Convention Nerd' |publisher=UGO.com |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> Although his name was mentioned as "Gary" in an early episode, later episodes give his name as "Arthur Kensington, Jr.". The Nerd imagines what it would be like to live in various well-known fantasy worlds.

* '''Where Are They Now?''' - A sketch in which [[Michael Moore]] investigates past media celebrities (often stars of old television programs that produced toylines) who have fallen into obscurity.

* '''''Robot Chicken'' has been cancelled''' - Four of the six season finales of ''Robot Chicken'' perpetuated a running gag in which [[Mike Lazzo]], the head of Adult Swim, announces that ''Robot Chicken'' has been cancelled.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>
