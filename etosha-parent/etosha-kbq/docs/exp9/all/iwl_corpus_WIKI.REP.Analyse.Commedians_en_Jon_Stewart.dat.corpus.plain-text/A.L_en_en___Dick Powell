'''Richard Ewing "Dick" Powell''' (November 14, 1904 – January 2, 1963) was an American singer, actor, film producer, film director and studio head.  Though he came to stardom as a musical comedy performer, he showed versatility and successfully transformed into a hardbitten leading man starring in projects of a more dramatic nature.

==Biography==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Powell was born in [[Mountain View, Arkansas|Mountain View]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/154687%7C38687/Dick-Powell/|title= Dick Powell|publisher= Turner Classic Movies|accessdate= September 12, 2012}}</ref> the seat of [[Stone County, Arkansas|Stone County]] in northern [[Arkansas]]. The family moved to Little Rock in 1914, where Powell sang in church choirs and with a local orchestras and started his own band.<ref name=gale/> Powell attended the former [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock|Little Rock College]], before he started his entertainment career as a [[singer]] with the  Royal Peacock Band which toured throughout the Midwest. During this time, he married Mildred Maund, a model, but she found being married to an entertainer not to her liking and they soon divorced.<ref name=gale/> Later, he joined the Charlie Davis Orchestra, based in [[Indianapolis]].<ref name=gale>"Richard Ewing Powell." ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1981) Charles Scribner's Sons,  New York</ref> He recorded a number of records with Davis and on his own, for the [[Vocalion]] label in the late 1920s.

Powell moved to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], where he found great local success as the Master of Ceremonies at the Enright Theater and the Stanley Theater.<ref name=gale/> In April 1930, [[Warner Bros.]] bought [[Brunswick Records]], which at that time owned Vocalion. Warner Bros. was sufficiently impressed by Powell's singing and stage presence to offer him a film contract in 1932. He made his film debut as a singing bandleader in ''Blessed Event''.<ref name=dict>"Dick Powell." ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers'' Vol. 3. (2000) Gale, Detroit</ref> He went on to star as a boyish crooner in movie musicals such as ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[Footlight Parade]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Flirtation Walk]]'', and ''[[On the Avenue]]'', often appearing opposite [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Joan Blondell]].<ref name=gale/>

Powell desperately wanted to expand his range, but Warner Bros. would not allow him to do so. As a result, he bought his release from Warner Bros. in 1940.<ref name=gale/> They did cast him in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935), but as Lysander, another youthful romantic character. This was to be Powell's only Shakespearean role and one he did not want to play, feeling that he was completely wrong for the part.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} By 1944, Powell felt he was too old to play romantic leading men anymore,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}, so he lobbied to play the lead in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]''. He lost out to [[Fred MacMurray]], another Hollywood nice guy. MacMurray’s success, however, fueled Powell’s resolve to pursue projects with greater range.

In 1944, Powell's career changed dramatically when he was cast in the first of a series of [[film noir|films noir]], as private detective [[Philip Marlowe]] in ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'', directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]]. The film was a big hit, and Powell had successfully reinvented himself as a dramatic actor. He was the first actor to play Marlowe — by name — in motion pictures. (Hollywood had previously adapted some Marlowe novels, but with the lead character changed.) Later, Powell was the first actor to play Marlowe on radio, in 1944 and 1945, and on television, in a 1954 episode of ''[[Climax!]]'' Powell also played the slightly less hard-boiled detective Richard Rogue in the radio series "Rogue's Gallery", beginning in 1945.

In 1945, Dmytryk and Powell reteamed to make the film ''[[Cornered (1945 film)|Cornered]]'', a gripping, post-WWII thriller that helped define the film noir style. He became a popular "tough guy" lead appearing in movies such as ''[[Johnny O'Clock]]'' and ''[[Cry Danger]]''. But in 1948, he stepped out of the brutish type when he starred in ''[[Pitfall (1948 film)|Pitfall]]'', a film noir in which a bored insurance company worker falls for an innocent but dangerous woman, played by [[Lizabeth Scott]]. Even when he appeared in lighter fare such as ''[[The Reformer and the Redhead]]'' and ''[[Susan Slept Here]]'' (1954), he never sang in his later roles.  The latter, his final onscreen appearance in a feature film, did include a dance number with costar [[Debbie Reynolds]].

From 1949–1953, Powell played the lead role in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] radio theater production ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''. His character in the 30-minute weekly was a likable private detective with a quick wit. Many episodes ended with Detective Diamond having an excuse to sing a little song to his date, showcasing Powell's vocal abilities. Many of the episodes were written by [[Blake Edwards]]. When ''Richard Diamond'' came to television in 1957, the lead role was portrayed by [[David Janssen]], who did no singing in the series.

In the 1950s, Powell was one of the founders of [[Four Star Television]],<ref name="obit"/> along with [[Charles Boyer]], [[David Niven]], and [[Ida Lupino]]. He appeared in and supervised several shows for that company. Powell played the role of Willie Dante in ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', in episodes entitled "Dante's Inferno" (1952), "The Squeeze" (1953), "The Hard Way" (1953), and "The House Always Wins" (1955). In 1961, [[Howard Duff]], husband of Ida Lupino, assumed the Dante role in a short-lived NBC adventure series ''[[Dante (TV series)|Dante]]'', set at a [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] nightclub called "Dante's Inferno".

Powell guest-starred in numerous Four Star programs, including a 1958 appearance on the Duff-Lupino sitcom ''[[Mr. Adams and Eve]]''. He appeared in 1961 on [[James Whitmore]]'s [[legal drama]] ''[[The Law and Mr. Jones]]'' on ABC. In the episode "Everybody Versus Timmy Drayton", Powell played a colonel having problems with his son. Shortly before his death, Powell sang on camera for the final time in a guest-star appearance on Four Star's ''[[Ensign O'Toole]]'', singing ''[[The Song of the Marines]]'', which he first sang in his [[1937]] film ''[[The Singing Marine]].''  He hosted and occasionally starred in his ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]'' on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] from 1956–1961, and his final anthology series, ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]'' on NBC from 1961 through 1963; after his death, the series continued through the end of its second season (as ''The Dick Powell Theater''), with guest hosts.

Powell's film ''[[The Enemy Below]]'' ([[1957 in film|1957]]), based on the novel by [[Denys Rayner]], won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Special Effects]].

Powell also directed ''[[The Conqueror (film)|The Conqueror]]'' (1956), starring [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]]. The exterior scenes were filmed in [[St. George, Utah]], downwind of U.S. above-ground atomic tests. The cast and crew totaled 220, and of that number, 91 had developed some form of cancer by 1981, and 46 had died of cancer by then, including Powell and Wayne. This cancer rate is about three times higher than one would expect in a group of this size, and many have argued that radioactive fallout was the cause.<ref>Olson, James (2002) ''Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer and History'', Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland ISBN 0-8018-6936-6</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Joan Blondell in Broadway Gondolier trailer.jpg|right|thumb]]
Powell was the son of Ewing Powell and Sallie Rowena Thompson.

He was married three times:
* Mildred Maund (1925–1927) — although most biographies say they were divorced in 1927, strong sources indicate this is not true. They appear on the 1930 census in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he is working in a theater, and they appear on a 1931 passenger list, where they are returning from [[Havana, Cuba]], aboard the [[SS Oriente|SS ''Oriente'']].
* [[Joan Blondell]] (married September 19, 1936, divorced 1944), with whom he had two children, Ellen and adopted son Norman
* [[June Allyson]] (August 19, 1945, until his death), with whom he had two children, Pamela (adopted) and Richard Powell, Jr.

Powell's [[ranch-style house]] was used for exterior filming on the ABC television series, ''[[Hart to Hart]]''. Powell was a friend of both ''Hart to Hart'' actor [[Robert Wagner]] and producer [[Aaron Spelling]]. The actual estate, known as Amber Hills, is situated on 48 acres in the [[Mandeville Canyon]] section of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]], [[Los Angeles]]. Dick Powell was a major television executive himself with his production company, Four Star Television, which owned several network shows.

Powell also enjoyed general aviation as a private pilot.<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|title=A Plane Crazy America|page=79|date=May 2014}}</ref>

==Illness and death==

On September 27, 1962, Powell acknowledged rumors that he was undergoing treatment for cancer. The disease was originally diagnosed as an allergy, with Powell first experiencing symptoms while traveling East to promote his program. Upon his return to California, Powell's personal physician conducted tests and found malignant growths on his neck and chest.<ref>{{cite journal |magazine=[[Broadcasting]] |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1962/1962-10-01-BC.pdf|format=PDF|title=Powell acknowledges cancer treatments|date=October 1, 1962|page=9}}</ref>

Powell died at the age of 58 on January 2, 1963. His body was [[cremation|cremated]] and his remains were interred in the Columbarium of Honor at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]]. In a 2001 interview with [[Larry King]], Powell's widow [[June Allyson]] confirmed his cause of death was [[lung cancer]] due to his [[chain smoking]].<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0107/04/lkl.00.html</ref>

Dick Powell has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6915 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodusa.co.uk/walkoffamestarlocations.htm#P. Hollywood Walk of Fame]</ref>

==Popular culture references==
[[Frank Tashlin]]'s [[cartoon]] satire ''[[The Woods Are Full Of Cuckoos|The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos]]'' (1937) features a caricature of Powell, a bird named "Dick Fowl".

The Travel Channel series ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]'' (2013) featured a segment about the fallout from the filming of ''[[The Conqueror (film)|The Conqueror]]'' with American actor Paul Meltzer as director Powell.
