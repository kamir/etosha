==Early life==
The eldest of three children, Forsythe was born as '''Jacob Lincoln Freund''' on January 29, 1918, in [[Penns Grove, New Jersey]], to Blanche Materson (née Blohm) and Samuel Jeremiah Freund. Blanche was born in Pennsylvania, to David Hyat Blohm, a Russian Jewish immigrant, and to Mary S. Materson, who was born in Maryland, to Jewish immigrants from Prussia. Samuel was a stockbroker born in New York to Polish Jewish immigrants.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/John-Forsythe.html "John Forsythe Biography"] Film Reference</ref> 

He was raised in [[Brooklyn]], where his father worked as a Wall Street businessman during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. He graduated from [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in Brooklyn at the age of 16, and began attending the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].<ref>Staff.

==Movie career and Army service==
[[Image:Forsythe.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The handprints of John Forsythe in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park.]]

Despite showing initial reluctance, Forsythe began an acting career at the suggestion of his father. He met actress Parker McCormick (December 1918 &ndash; July 1980), and the couple married in 1939; they had a son, Dall (born February 14, 1941), and divorced in 1943. As a bit player for [[Warner Brothers]], Forsythe successfully appeared in several small parts. As a result he was given a small role in ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' (1943). Leaving his movie career for service in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in [[World War II]], he appeared in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] play and film ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]'', then worked with injured soldiers who had developed speech problems.

Also in 1943, Forsythe met Julie Warren, initially a theatre companion, but later a successful actress in her own right, landing a role on Broadway in ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]''. Warren became Forsythe's second wife and in the early 1950s the marriage produced two daughters &ndash; Page<ref>{{IMDb name|0287110|Page Forsythe}}</ref> and Brooke.<ref>{{IMDb name|0287087|Brooke Forsythe}}</ref>
In 1947, Forsythe joined the initial class of the soon-to-be prestigious [[Actors Studio]], where he met other promising young actors including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Julie Harris]]. During this time he appeared on Broadway in ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'' and ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (play)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]''.

In 1955 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] cast Forsythe in the movie ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'', with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her first movie appearance, for which she won a [[Golden Globe]].

==Television work==
[[File:Bachelor Father, 1961.jpg|thumb|right|With Noreen Corcoran in ''Bachelor Father'' (1957-1962)]]
Throughout the 1950s, Forsythe successfully appeared in the new medium and worked regularly on all the networks, especially as a guest star. For example, during this period, he appeared on the popular anthology ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' in an episode titled "Premonition" opposite [[Cloris Leachman]]. Forsythe also starred in an episode of the [[CBS]] Western anthology series ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre|Zane Grey Theatre]]'' titled ''Decision at Wilson's Creek'', which premiered May 17, 1957. Outdoor location sequences for the episode were shot on the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth, Calif.]], where a number of scenes took place in a group of oak trees on the Upper Iverson that later came to be known as the Midway Oaks. One of those oak trees, a distinctive multi-trunked tree with a characteristic lean, became known as the Forsythe Oak, commemorating John Forsythe's appearance at the fabled movie ranch, considered the most widely filmed outdoor location in movie and television history. The Forsythe Oak remains in place today, located on a private estate on the former Upper Iverson.

===''Bachelor Father''===
In 1957, he took a leading role in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' for [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] as Bentley Gregg, a playboy lawyer who has to become a father to his niece Kelly (played by [[Noreen Corcoran]]), upon the death of her biological parents. The show was an immediate ratings hit and moved to [[NBC]] the following season and to ABC in the fall of 1961. On various episodes Forsythe worked with such up-and-coming actresses as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Barbara Eden]], [[Donna Douglas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Sue Ane Langdon]], and a teenaged [[Linda Evans]]. During the 1961 season, ''Bachelor Father'' moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], but was cancelled that season due to declining ratings.

===After ''Bachelor Father''===
In the early 1960s, Forsythe returned to acting in movies including ''[[Kitten with a Whip]]'' (1964), ''[[Madame X (1966 film)|Madame X]]'' (1966) and ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'' (1967). In 1964 he starred in the made for [[TV Movie]] ''[[See How They Run (1964 film)|See How They Run]]'' which is notable for being the first movie made for television. He also attempted two new television programs: ''[[The John Forsythe Show]]'' on NBC with [[Guy Marks]], [[Elsa Lanchester]], [[Ann B. Davis]], [[Peggy Lipton]], and Forsythe's two young daughters, Page and Brooke (1965–1966), and ''[[To Rome with Love (TV series)|To Rome with Love]]'' on CBS (1969–1971) with co-star [[Walter Brennan]]. Between 1971 and 1977, Forsythe served as narrator on the syndicated nature series, ''The World of Survival''. He was also the announcer for [[Michelob]] beer commercials from the 70s through about 1985, notably during the "Weekends were made for Michelob" era.

===''Charlie's Angels''===
Forsythe began a 13-year association with [[Aaron Spelling]] in 1976, cast in the role of mysterious unseen millionaire private investigator Charles Townsend in the crime drama ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976–1981). The show starred [[Kate Jackson]], [[Jaclyn Smith]], and [[Farrah Fawcett]], making stars of all three but catapulting Fawcett to iconic status. Forsythe introduces the series' concept during its opening credits:
{{cquote|Once upon a time, three little girls went to the police academy, where they were each assigned very hazardous duties. But I took them away from all that, and now they work for me. My name is Charlie.}}

On every episode, Forsythe, as Townsend, is heard over a speaker phone, instructing the eponymous Angels on their mission for the episode. Character actor [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] played Charlie's on-screen liaison to the Angels, who in later seasons included [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Shelley Hack]], and [[Tanya Roberts]]. ''Charlie's Angels'' was a huge success, and was shown in more than 90 countries.

Forsythe became the highest paid actor on television on a per-hour basis: while the show's on-camera stars often worked 15-hour days five days a week, with a couple of hours just for hair and makeup, Forsythe's lines for an entire episode would be recorded in a sound studio in a matter of minutes, after which he would have lunch in the network's commissary and then head for the track. During this period, Forsythe invested a lot of money in [[thoroughbred]] racing, a personal hobby. Gaining respect with the celebrity thoroughbred circuit, he served on the Board of Directors at the [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]] starting in 1972, and was on the committee for more than 25 years. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Following heart problems, Forsythe underwent quadruple [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] in 1979. This was so successful that he not only returned to work on ''Charlie's Angels'', he also appeared in the two-time [[Academy Award]]-nominated motion picture ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'' later that year as Judge Henry T. Fleming, the film's main antagonist, an evil corrupt judge who despises [[Al Pacino]]'s lawyer character.

===''Dynasty''===
In 1981, nearing the end of ''Charlie's Angels'', Forsythe was selected as a last-minute replacement for [[George Peppard]] in the role of conniving patriarch [[Blake Carrington]] in ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Another Aaron Spelling production, ''Dynasty'' was ABC's answer to the highly successful [[CBS]] series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. Between 1985 and 1987, Forsythe also appeared as Blake Carrington in the short-lived spinoff series ''[[The Colbys]]''. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The series reunited Forsythe with one-time ''Bachelor Father'' guest star [[Linda Evans]], who would play Blake's wife, Krystle. During the run of the series, Forsythe, Evans and another co-star [[Joan Collins]], who played Blake's ex-wife Alexis, promoted the ''Dynasty'' line of fragrances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/perfumes_forever.htm|title=TVAcres.com}}</ref> ''Dynasty'' came to an end in 1989, after a total of nine seasons. Forsythe was the only actor to appear in all 220 episodes.

Forsythe was nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s three times between 1982 and 1984 for "Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series" but did not win. He was also nominated six times for [[Golden Globe Award]]s, winning twice. He was nominated five times for the [[Soap Opera Digest|''Soap Opera Digest'' Awards]], also winning twice.

Linda Evans who said in a 2012 interview with Halli Casser Jayne, about Forsythe, if he had a pretty good memory off- the ''Dynasty'' set: "When I did meet him in ''Bachelor Father'' it was a show called 'Crush on Bentley,' and his niece that was 'The Bachelor Father,' of and I were the same age, 15 years old ([[Noreen Corcoran]]). We did the show and I had a crush on Bentley, and in the end, he fixes me up with these football players, and it was so sweet getting to know him, then, and he signed my script, because it was my first speaking part and he put on it, 'Linda, you're going to be somebody someday and I found it when I was doing ''Dynasty,''' and brought on the set and say, 'See John, you were psychic, you knew this was going to happen.' It was so easy when I saw him when I walked on the set of ''Dynasty.'' He looked at me and he said, 'Mine Linda Evans, did how you're grown and how's your mother, Arlene?' And he remembered my mother's name. He remembered my real name - which is Evanstad. MGM Studios later changed it to Evans. I said, 'Oh John, it's going to be so easy to love you in this part and it was Heaven to work with him, absolute Heaven, he had the most delicious sense of humor. He would make me laugh, all day long and we had so much drama, and on the script of ''Dynasty,'' and fights and things that we had to do with people, and he would constantly just joking/laughing, saying, 'Come on, you can do this?,' And we have to go out to get some awards and I was afraid to get up and in-front of people, when I was in junior high school - from that day, I was so shy and get up to do a book report, and he would encourage me and take my hand and walk up with me, he was extraordinary. We remained friends until he died, I talked to him like 3 weeks before he passed, and we talked all the time."<ref>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/thehallicasserjayneshow/2012/08/01/linda-evans-marsha-mason-gil-garcetti-second-acts</ref>

===''The Powers That Be''===
In 1992, after a three-year absence, Forsythe returned to series television starring in [[Norman Lear]]'s [[situation comedy]], ''[[The Powers That Be (TV series)|The Powers That Be]]'' for NBC, co-starring [[Holland Taylor]], [[Peter MacNicol]], [[Valerie Mahaffey]] and [[David Hyde-Pierce]]. He was reunited with one-time co-star [[Cloris Leachman]], who, although eight years his junior, played his mother in one episode. The show was canceled after only one year.
