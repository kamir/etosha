Colbert had originally planned to run for both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominations in his home state of [[South Carolina]]. Upon obtaining the forms to put himself on the ballot, however, he discovered to do so requires a non-refundable fee of $25,000 plus a $10,000 late fee for the Republican primary and $2,500 or three thousand signatures on a petition for the Democratic primary.<ref name="dysfunction"/>  On the October 31, 2007 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert announced that he would no longer be seeking a spot on the Republican Party ballot, primarily because he was unwilling to write a $35,000 check to the Republican Party, but also because spending more than $5,000 on his campaign would make him subject to greater levels of scrutiny under federal election law. However, Colbert reaffirmed his bid for a Democratic ballot spot by displaying a photograph of himself holding a $2,500 personal check made out to the Democratic Party, as well as a notarized application form for the Democratic ballot.

The following day, November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party executive council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. “The general sense of the council was that he wasn’t a serious candidate and that was why he wasn’t selected to be on the ballot," stated John Werner, the party's director.<ref name="SCDems" />  Colbert has announced that he will not continue his campaign.<ref>[http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=282528&GT1=7703 Stephen Colbert Drops Presidential Bid -from MSN TV news]</ref>

On the April 28, 2008 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', guest [[Feist (singer)|Feist]] said that she had been planning to offer her song "[[1234 (song)|1234]]" as the official campaign theme.<ref>[http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=167089 Feist | The Colbert Report | Comedy Central<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

At the [[2008 Libertarian National Convention]], Colbert received one write-in vote for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nomination in the second round of voting.

On the June 11, 2009 show, Colbert stated that if he were to run for president again, he would claim his time spent in [[Iraq]] as part of the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] as "military service." Colbert was in Iraq as a part of [[Stephen_Colbert_(character)#Operation_Iraqi_Stephen:_Going_Commando_2009_Visit_to_Baghdad.2C_Iraq|Operation Iraqi Stephen]], a tour aimed at supporting and boosting the morale of the [[United States Military]] in [[Iraq]].

===Opinion polling===

Prior to Colbert's announcement, ''Colbert Report'' staff had consulted representatives of both parties. Joe Werner, executive director of the [[South Carolina Democratic Party|State Democratic Party]], had been called by a Colbert representative three weeks before the announcement, for queries regarding filing dates and other requirements. Katon Dawson, chairman of the [[South Carolina Republican Party|State GOP]], had been called on October 15, a handful of hours before the show declaring Colbert's candidacy was taped. Estimations of Colbert's chances were mixed, but neither party disputed his ability to place himself on their respective ballots. The dual Republican–Democrat nature of the run, however, elicited opposing responses from the party representatives. Dawson found nothing in his party's regulations preventing Colbert from running on both ballots, but Werner was more leery at the suggestion. Said Werner: "I don’t believe you can do that."<ref>Steinberg, Jacques (October 28, 2007).
