'''Stephen Glenn''' "'''Steve'''" '''Martin''' (born August 14, 1945) is an American comedian, actor, musician, writer, and producer.

Martin came to public notice as a writer for the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and later became a frequent guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, [[surreal humor|absurdist]] comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from [[stand-up comedy]], Martin has become a successful actor, as well as an author, playwright, pianist and banjo player, eventually earning him an [[Emmy]], [[Grammy]] and [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy]] awards, among other honors.

In 2004, [[Comedy Central]]<ref>[http://everything2.com/title/Comedy+Central%2527s+100+Greatest+Stand-Ups+of+all+Time Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time]</ref> ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics. He was awarded an honorary Oscar at the Academy’s 5th Annual [[Governors Awards]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Academy Unveils 2013 Governors Awards: Honorees Angelina Jolie, Angela Lansbury, Steve Martin, Piero Tosi|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/governors-awards-2013-winners-academy-oscars/|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref>

While he has played [[banjo]] since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music in the past decade and a half; acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording and touring with various bluegrass acts, including [[Earl Scruggs]], with whom he won a [[Grammy]] for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002.  He released his first solo music album, ''[[The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo]]'', in 2009, for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album.

During [[World War II]], in England, Martin's father had appeared in a production of ''[[Our Town]]'' with [[Raymond Massey]]. Years later, he would write to Massey for help in Steve's fledgling career, but would receive no reply. Expressing his affection through gifts of cars, bikes, etc., Martin's father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.<ref Name="Mild"/> He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Dominic |title= Steve Martin – Biography

That lasted for three years (1955–58). During his free time he frequented the [[Main Street, U.S.A.#Shopping|Main Street Magic shop]], where tricks were demonstrated to potential customers.<ref Name="Mild"/> By 1960, he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions, and took a paying job at the Magic shop in [[Fantasyland]] in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor [[Wally Boag]],<ref name=Boag>Martin (2007) p18–19</ref> frequently performing for tips.<ref>Martin (2007) p 39</ref> In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could "be described most accurately as an [[agnostic]] [...] he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition".<ref>Walker (1999) p40</ref>

===Comedy===
After high school graduation, Martin attended [[Santa Ana College|Santa Ana Junior College]], taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and [[Garden Grove High School]] classmate [[Kathy Westmoreland]] to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at [[Knott's Berry Farm]].<ref Name="Mild"/> Later, he met budding actress [[Stormie Omartian|Stormie Sherk]], and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the [[California State University, Long Beach]], for enrollment with a major in Philosophy.<ref Name="Mild"/> Stormie enrolled at [[UCLA]], about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.<ref>Martin (2007) p 65</ref>

Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. His time at college changed his life. "It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequitur]]s appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying [[logic]], and they were talking about [[Causality|cause and effect]], and you start to realize, 'Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything!' Then it gets real easy to write this stuff, because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the [[climax (narrative)|punch line]], you twist the [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]] so hard away from the things that set it up".<ref name=RS>Fong-Torres, Ben (1982) "Steve Martin Sings: The Rolling Stone Interview". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' February 18, 1982. Issue 363</ref> Martin recalls wondering in a psychology class "What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax? What would the audience do with all that tension? Theoretically, it would have to come out sometime. But if I kept denying them the formality of a punch line, the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh, essentially out of desperation."<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/funny-martin-200802.html##ixzz0wdmDQ0Bs "Being Funny: How the path-breaking comedian got his act together" By Steve Martin. ''Smithsonian magazine''. February 2008]. Retrieved August 14, 2010</ref> Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. "If you're studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life."<ref>{{IMDb name|0000188}}</ref>

In 1967, Martin transferred to [[UCLA]] and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of ''[[The Dating Game]]''. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one he dropped out of college.<ref>[http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php "SteveMartin.com | Stop the Presses"]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career – stand-up===

In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer [[Mason Williams]].<ref>Martin, (2007) p. 76</ref> Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/steve-martin Steve Martin Emmy Award Winner]</ref> in 1969, aged 23.<ref name="Mild"/> He also wrote for [[John Denver]] (a neighbor of his in [[Aspen, Colorado]], at one point), ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]].'' Martin's first TV appearance was on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in 1969. He says: "[I] appeared on ''The [[Virginia Graham]] Show,'' circa 1970. I looked grotesque. I had a hairdo like a helmet, which I blow-dried to a puffy bouffant, for reasons I no longer understand. I wore a frock coat and a silk shirt, and my delivery was mannered, slow and self-aware. I had absolutely no authority. After reviewing the show, I was depressed for a week."<ref name="Smith" /> During these years his roommates included comedian [[Gary Mule Deer]] and singer/guitarist [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]].<ref>Martin, (2007) p. 77</ref> Martin opened for groups such as [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[The Carpenters]], and [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. He appeared at San Francisco's [[The Boarding House (nightclub)|The Boarding House]], among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on ''[[Dick Van Dyke|Van Dyke and Company]]'' in 1976.

In the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.,<ref name="Smith">{{cite web | author=Martin, Steve | year=2008 | title=Being Funny | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/funny-martin-200802.html |work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] | accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> and on  ''[[The Gong Show]]'', [[HBO]]'s ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=078644259X|page=218}}</ref> and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). ''SNL''{{'s}} audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances and was one of the most successful SNL hosts.<ref name="Mild"/> Martin appeared on 27 ''Saturday Night Live'' shows and he guest-hosted 15 times, bested only in number of presentations by host [[Alec Baldwin]] (who has hosted 16 times {{as of|2011|September|lc=y}}). On the show, Martin popularized the [[air quotes]] gesture, which uses four fingers to make double quote marks in the air.<ref name="Frum">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= 36–37|url= }}</ref> While on the show Martin became close with several of the cast members, including [[Gilda Radner]]. On the day Radner died of [[ovarian cancer]] in 1989, a visibly shaken Martin hosted ''SNL'' and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch.

In the 1970s, his TV appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]].<ref name="Mild"/> The track "Excuse Me" on his first album, ''[[Let's Get Small]]'', helped establish a national catch phrase.<ref name="Mild"/> His next album, ''[[A Wild and Crazy Guy]]'' (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. "Just a wild and crazy guy" became another of Martin's known catch phrases.<ref name="Mild"/> The album featured a character based on a series of ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches where Martin and [[Dan Aykroyd]] played "Georgi" and "Yortuk" the Festrunk Brothers, a couple of bumbling [[Czechoslovak]] would-be playboys. The album ends with the song "[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]", sung and written by Martin and backed by the "Toot Uncommons", members of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies.<ref name="Mild">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684540,00.html "Steve Martin, a Mild and Crazy Guy". ''Time Magazine'' article. November 15, 2007]. Retrieved August 14, 2010.</ref><ref>{{YouTube|wgTPH5y1-ZI|"King Tut" Video}}. Retrieved August 14, 2010.</ref> The song came out during the [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]] craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king's tomb artifacts. Both albums won [[Grammy]]s for ''Best Comedy Recording'' in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed "King Tut" on the April 22, 1978, edition of ''SNL''.

Decades later, in 2012, the [[A.V. Club]] described Martin's unique style and its impact on audiences:
{{blockquote|"[Martin was] both a consummate entertainer and a glib, knowing parody of a consummate entertainer. He was at once a hammy populist with an uncanny, unprecedented feel for the tastes of a mass audience and a sly intellectual whose goofy shtick cunningly deconstructed stand-up comedy."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Steve Martin: The Television Stuff|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/steve-martin-the-television-stuff,88419/|publisher=Onion Inc.|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>}}

On his comedy albums, Martin's stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of "happy feet", banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like [[venereal disease]], and the controversial kitten juggling (he is a master juggler). His style is off-kilter and ironic, and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from ''A Wild and Crazy Guy'') by saying, "I think there's nothing better for a person to come up and do the same thing over and over for two weeks. This is what I enjoy, so I'm going to do the same thing over and over and over [...] I'm going to do the same joke over and over in the same show, it'll be like a new thing."  Or: "Hello, I'm Steve Martin, and I'll be out here in a minute."<ref name="Frum"/><ref>[http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/40968/"Rationalist of the Absurd: Steve Martin's extraordinarily calculated comedy".''New York Books" November 18, 2007]. Retrieved August 12, 2010 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In one comedy routine, used on the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album, Martin claimed that his real name was "Gern Blanston". The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as their name.<ref>Martin (2007) p176–77</ref> He stopped stand-up in 1981 to concentrate on movies and never went back.<ref name="Mild"/>

===Acting career – film===
[[File:Steve Martin.jpg|thumb|right|Martin in 1982]]
By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was "just an accident" for him; his real goal was to get into film.<ref name=RS/>

Martin had a small role in the 1972 film ''[[Another Nice Mess]]''. His first substantial film appearance was in a [[short film|short]] titled ''[[The Absent-Minded Waiter]]'' (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring [[Buck Henry]] and [[Teri Garr]], was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|''Best Short Film, Live Action'']]. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', where he sang [[The Beatles]]' "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]". In 1979, Martin co-wrote and starred in ''[[The Jerk (film)|The Jerk]]'', directed by [[Carl Reiner]]. The movie was a huge success, grossing over $100&nbsp;million on a budget of approximately $4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris Brummel | year=2010 | title= The Jerk | url = http://chrisbrummel.com/the-jerk-that-movie-about-hating-cans| accessdate=June 19, 2010}}</ref>

[[Stanley Kubrick]] met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of ''[[Dream Story|Traumnovelle]]'' (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999's ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''). Martin was executive producer for ''Domestic Life'', a prime-time television series starring friend [[Martin Mull]], and a late-night series called ''Twilight Theater''. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'', based on the 1978 BBC serial by [[Dennis Potter]]. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director [[Herbert Ross]], and spent months learning how to [[tap dance]]. The film was a financial failure; Martin's comment at the time was "I don't know what to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy."<ref>''American film'' Volume 7. 1981. [[American Film Institute]], [[Arthur M. Sackler]] Foundation</ref>

Martin was in three more Reiner-directed comedies after ''The Jerk'': ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' in 1982, ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' in 1983 and ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'' in 1984, possibly his most critically acclaimed comic performance to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000640-all_of_me/ |title=All of Me|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05EEDA143AF932A1575AC0A962948260 "Steve Martin In 'All Of Me'"].

In 1986, Martin joined fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veterans [[Martin Short]] and [[Chevy Chase]] in ''[[Three Amigos|¡Three Amigos!]]'', directed by [[John Landis]], and written by Martin, [[Lorne Michaels]], and singer-songwriter [[Randy Newman]]. It was originally entitled ''The Three [[Knight|Caballero]]s'' and Martin was to be teamed with [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]]. In 1986, Martin was in the movie musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|film version]] of the hit [[Off-Broadway]] play [[Little Shop of Horrors (musical play)|''Little Shop of Horrors'']] (based on a famous [[The Little Shop of Horrors|B-movie]]), playing the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello. The film was the first of three films teaming Martin with [[Rick Moranis]]. In 1987, Martin joined comedian [[John Candy]] in the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] movie ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]].'' That same year, ''[[Roxanne (film)|Roxanne]]'', the film adaptation of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which Martin co-wrote, won him a [[Writers Guild of America Award]]. It also garnered recognition from Hollywood and the public that he was more than a comedian. In 1988, he performed in the [[Frank Oz]] film ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]'', a remake of ''[[Bedtime Story (film)|Bedtime Story]]'', alongside [[Michael Caine]].

Martin starred in the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'', with Moranis in 1989. He later re-teamed with Moranis in the [[Mafia]] comedy ''[[My Blue Heaven (1990 film)|My Blue Heaven]]'' (1990). In 1991, Martin starred in and wrote ''[[L.A. Story]]'', a romantic comedy, in which the female lead was played by his then-wife [[Victoria Tennant]]. Martin also appeared in [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s ''[[Grand Canyon (1991 film)|Grand Canyon]]'', in which he played the tightly wound Hollywood film producer, Davis, who was recovering from a traumatic robbery that left him injured, which was a more serious role for him. Martin also starred in a remake of the comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' in 1991 (followed by a [[Father of the Bride Part II|sequel]] in 1995), and in the 1992 comedy ''[[Housesitter (film)|Housesitter]]'', with [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Dana Delany]].

In [[David Mamet]]'s 1997 thriller, ''[[The Spanish Prisoner]]'', Martin played a darker role as a wealthy stranger who takes a suspicious interest in the work of a young businessman ([[Campbell Scott]]). He went on to star with [[Eddie Murphy]] in the 1999 comedy ''[[Bowfinger]],'' which Martin also wrote. He appeared in a version of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' as [[Vladimir (character)|Vladimir]], with [[Robin Williams]] as [[Estragon]] and [[Bill Irwin]] as Lucky. In 1998, Martin guest starred with [[U2]] in the 200th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[Trash of the Titans]]", providing the voice for sanitation commissioner Ray Patterson. In 1999, Martin and Hawn starred in a remake of the 1970 [[Neil Simon]] comedy, ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1999 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]''. By 2003, Martin ranked fourth on the box office stars list, after starring in ''[[Bringing Down the House (film)|Bringing Down The House]]'' and ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper By The Dozen]]'', each of which earned over $130&nbsp;million at U.S. theaters. That same year, he also played the villainous Mr. Chairman in the animation/live action blend, ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''.

In 2005, Martin wrote and starred in ''[[Shopgirl]]'', based on his own novella (2000), and starred in ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]''. In 2006, he starred in the box office hit ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'', as the bumbling [[Inspector Clouseau]]. He reprised the role in 2009's ''[[The Pink Panther 2]]''. When combined, the two films grossed over $230 million at the box office. In ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'' (2008), Martin played the founder of a health food company, and in ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'' (2009), he played opposite [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Alec Baldwin]]. In 2009, an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed Martin as one of the best actors never to receive an Oscar nomination.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer |first=Leigh |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/feb/19/best-actors-never-nominated-for-oscars |title=Oscars: the best actors never to have been nominated |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 19, 2009|accessdate=November 13, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> In 2011, he appeared with [[Jack Black]], [[Owen Wilson]], and [[JoBeth Williams]] in the birdwatching comedy ''[[The Big Year]]''.

===Writing===
[[File:Steve Martin by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Martin at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]]]
In 1993, Martin wrote his first full-length play ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]''. The first reading of the play took place in [[Beverly Hills, California]], at Steve Martin's home, with [[Tom Hanks]] reading the role of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Chris Sarandon]] reading the role of [[Albert Einstein]]. Following this, the play opened at the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and played from October 1993 to May 1994, then went on to run successfully in Los Angeles, New York City and several other US cities.<ref>[http://www.steppenwolf.org/ensemble/history/productions/index.aspx?id=122 History: ''Picasso At The Lapin Agile''.

Retrieved August 14, 2010</ref> In 2009, the school board in [[La Grande, Oregon]], refused to allow the play to be performed after several parents complained about the content. In an open letter in the local ''Observer'' newspaper, Martin wrote "I have heard that some in your community have characterized the play as 'people drinking in bars, and treating women as sex objects.' With apologies to William Shakespeare, this is like calling ''Hamlet'' a play about a castle [...] I will finance a non-profit, off-high school campus production [...] so that individuals, outside the jurisdiction of the school board but within the guarantees of freedom of expression provided by the Constitution of the United States can determine whether they will or will not see the play".<ref>[http://www.lagrandeobserver.com/Opinion/Guest-Columns/Of-arts-and-sciences "Of arts and sciences". by Steve Martin.

===Music===
Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has claimed in several interviews and in his memoir, ''Born Standing Up'', that he used to take 33 rpm [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note, and perfect his playing.

Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from [[John McEuen]], who later joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song, "King Tut", being credited as "The Toot Uncommons" (as in [[Tutankhamun]]).

The banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.<ref Name="Smith"/> On the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album he included an all-instrumental jam, titled "Drop Thumb Medley", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, ''[[The Steve Martin Brothers]]'' (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.

In 2001, he played banjo on [[Earl Scruggs]]'s remake of "[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]". The recording was the winner of the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]] category at the [[Grammy Awards of 2002]]. In 2008, Martin appeared with the band, In the Minds of the Living, during a show in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/06/steve-martin-plays-the-ba_n_310858.html "Steve Martin Plays The Banjo Really Well (Video)]"].

Investigators at Berlin's state criminal police office (LKA) think that Martin was one victim of a German master art forger [[Wolfgang Beltracchi]]. In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be a 1915 work by the German-Dutch painter [[Heinrich Campendonk]], ''Landschaft mit Pferden'' (''Landscape With Horses'') from a Paris gallery for what should have been a bargain price of around €700,000 (around $850,000 at the time). Before the purchase an expert authenticated the work and identified the painter's signature on a label attached to the back. Fifteen months later Martin put the painting up for sale, and auction house Christie's disposed of it in February 2006, to a Swiss businesswoman for €500,000 – a loss of €200,000. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from an invented art collection devised by a group of German swindlers caught in 2010. Skillfully forged paintings from this group were sold to French galleries like the one where Martin bought the forgery.<ref>{{cite web
