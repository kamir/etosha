The '''College of William & Mary in Virginia''' (also known as '''William & Mary''', or '''W&M''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], United States. Privately founded in 1693 by [[Letter patent|letters patent]] issued by [[William and Mary|King William III and Queen Mary II]], it is the [[Colonial Colleges|second-oldest]] institution of [[higher education]] in the United States after [[Harvard University]] and the oldest in the [[American South]]. William & Mary is considered one of the original "[[Public Ivy|Public Ivies]]," a term coined by Richard Moll in 1985 for publicly funded universities providing a quality of education claimed to be comparable to that available in the [[Ivy League]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Moll |first=Richard |title=Public Ivys: A Guide to America's best public undergraduate colleges and universities |year=1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Greene, Howard and Matthew |title=The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities |year=2001}}</ref>

William & Mary educated U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Tyler]] as well as other key figures important to the development of the nation, including U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]], and 16 signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. W&M founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] academic [[honor society]] in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an [[honor code]] of conduct for students. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the [[first university in the United States|first universities in the United States]].

In addition to its undergraduate program (which includes an international joint degree program with the [[University of St Andrews]] and a joint engineering program with [[Columbia University]]), W&M is home to several graduate and professional schools, including computer science, law, business, public policy, education, marine science and colonial history.

==History==
{{Main|History of The College of William & Mary}}

===Colonial era: 1693–1776===
[[File:James Blair.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Blair (Virginia)|Reverend Dr. James Blair]], founder of William & Mary]]
A school of higher education for both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the [[Virginia Colony]]. The College was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (legally, letters patent) to "''make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/charter/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> Named in honor of the reigning monarchs [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], the College is the second oldest college in the United States. The original plans for the College date back to 1618, decades before Harvard. In 1695 before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the Sir Christopher Wren Building, then known only as the College Building, and is the oldest college building in America. The College is one of the country's nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]]. The Charter named James Blair as the College's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William & Mary was founded as an [[Anglican]] institution; students were required to be members of the [[Church of England]], and professors were required to declare adherence to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].<ref>Webster, Homer J. (1902) "Schools and Colleges in Colonial Times," ''The New England Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly'', v. XXVII, p. 374, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&pg=PA373 Google Books entry]</ref>

The school's charter called for a center of higher education consisting of three schools. The Philosophy School instructed students in the advanced study of moral philosophy (logic, rhetoric, ethics) as well as natural philosophy (physics, metaphysics, and mathematics); upon completion of this coursework, the Divinity School prepared these young men for [[ordination]] in the [[Church of England]]. This curriculum made William & Mary the first American college with a full faculty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 1693, the College was [[university constituency|given a seat]] in the [[House of Burgesses]] and it was determined that the College would be supported by [[tobacco]] taxes and export duties on [[fur]]s and animal skins. The College acquired a {{convert|330|acre|km2}} parcel for the new school,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm|title=williamsburgpostcards.com|author=Sedo GmbH|work=williamsburgpostcards.com}}</ref> {{convert|8|mi|km}} from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.

[[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 by the Crown and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the College served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Tyler]]. The College has been called “the Alma Mater of a Nation” because of its close ties to America’s founding fathers. A 17-year-old [[George Washington]] received his surveyor's license through the College and would return as its first American chancellor. William & Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a Royal Charter, the first Greek-letter society ([[Phi Beta Kappa]], founded in 1776), the first student honor code and the first [[College of William and Mary School of Law|law school]] in America. The College became a state-supported school in 1906 and went coed in 1918. In 1928, [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] chose the Wren as the first building to be returned to its 18th-century appearance as part of the iconic [[Colonial Williamsburg]] restoration.<ref>[http://www.wm.edu/about/history/index.php William & Mary – History & Traditions].

===Revolution and transition===
[[File:Jamesmonroe-npgallery.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Monroe]], 5th President of US, W&M alumnus]]
During the period of the American Revolution, [[freedom of religion]] was established in Virginia and the [[separation of church and state]] achieved, notably with the 1786 passage of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. Future U.S. President [[James Madison]] was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and [[James Madison (Episcopal Bishop)|Right Reverend James Madison]], his cousin and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was on the [[Board of Visitors]], helped The College of William & Mary to make the transition as well. The college became the first American university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine. As its President, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |title=Virginia Vignettes » What Was the Brafferton School? |publisher=Virginiavignettes.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>

The College of William and Mary is home to the nation's first [[collegiate secret societies in North America|collegiate secret society]], the [[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], popularly known as the [[Flat Hat Club]], founded November 11, 1750.  On December 5, 1776, students [[John Heath (politician)|John Heath]] and [[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]] (Class of 1779) founded [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a secret literary and philosophical society.  Other [[Secret societies at the College of William & Mary|secret societies]] known to currently exist at the College include: The [[Seven Society (College of William & Mary)|7 Society]], 13 Club, Alpha Club, [[Bishop James Madison Society]], The Society, The Spades, W Society, and [[Wren Society]].<ref>[http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/2049 Shhh! The Secret Side to the College’s Lesser Known Societies – The DoG Street Journal]</ref><ref>[http://www.flathatnews.com/variety/2284/peeking-into-closed-societies Peeking Into Closed Societies – The Flat Hat]</ref>

[[Thomas Roderick Dew]], who was a professor of history, metaphysics, and political economy, became president of the college in 1836. He served until his death in 1846. [[Nathaniel Beverley Tucker]] was also a prominent faculty member at this time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1842, alumni of the College formed the Society of the Alumni<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.wm.edu/history/index.shtml |title=William & Mary Alumni > History |publisher=Alumni.wm.edu |author=F. James Barnes, II |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College. The [[Alumni House (College of William & Mary)|Alumni House]] is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, and the Brafferton.

=== Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century ===
[[File:Wren 1859 william and mary.jpg|thumb|left|Wren Building, 1859–1862]]
At the outset of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), enlistments in the [[Confederate Army]] depleted the student body and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the College for the duration of the conflict. The [[Wren Building|College Building]] was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The [[Battle of Williamsburg]] was fought nearby during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] on May 5, 1862, and the city fell to the Union the next day. The [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton building of the College]] was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the College Building,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |title=1850–1899 &#124; Historical Facts |work=Historical Chronology of William and Mary |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.

Following restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War. The College's 16th president, [[Benjamin S. Ewell|Benjamin Stoddert Ewell]], finally reopened the school in 1869 using his personal funds but the College closed in 1882 due to lack of funds. In 1888, William & Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] passed an act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/normal/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> appropriating $10,000 to support the College as a state teacher-training institution. [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler]] (son of US President and alumnus [[John Tyler]]) became the 17th president of the College following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler, along with 18th president [[J.A.C. Chandler]], expanded the College into a modern institution. In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, William & Mary became one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women and become [[coeducational]].<ref>[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html Women at UVa: Graduate and Professional Schools]. .lib.virginia.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-09.</ref> During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932.
[[File:William and Mary College, Williamsburg, Virginia, circa 1902.jpg|thumb|right|The College, c. 1902]]
Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, [[W.A.R. Goodwin|Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin]], the Sir Christopher Wren Building, the President's House and the Brafferton (the President's office) were restored to their 18th century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and his wife, [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].

===1930–present===
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}
In 1930, William & Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. This extension began at the close of World War II to serve the needs created by the GI Bill and was known as St. Alana's.  This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as [[Old Dominion University]].

Significant campus construction continued under the College's nineteenth president, [[John Stewart Bryan]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received an honorary degree from the College on October 20, 1934.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10917FF3B5D167A93C3AB178BD95F408385F9&scp=3&sq=william%20and%20mary&st=cse Roosevelt's Address at William and Mary – Article – NYTimes.com]. Select.nytimes.com (1934-10-21). Retrieved on 2013-08-09.</ref> In 1935, the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Garden]] was constructed, just west of the Wren Building. The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at [[Chelsea Hospital]] in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

The College has a history of supporting freedom of the press dating back at least to the 1940s. In 1945, for example, the College administration sanctioned the student Marilyn Kaemmerle for an article she had written in [[The Flat Hat]] supporting the end of [[racist]] policies of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[anti-miscegenation]] and [[white supremacy]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,792051,00.html Education: Jefferson's Heirs], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 26, 1945</ref> According to [[Time Magazine]], in response, over one-thousand William & Mary students held "a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson." She was pardoned by the college Board of Visitors decades later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Marilyn_Kaemmerle|title=Marilyn Kaemmerle|work=wm.edu}}</ref>

Historically, The College did not admit African-American students.  It admitted its first black student,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Hulon Willis, into a graduate program in 1951 because the program was unavailable at Virginia State. However, the College did not open all programs to African-American students until around 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Desegregation_in_Higher_Education#start_entry|title=Desegregation in Higher Education in Virginia|first=Peter|last=Wallenstein|accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>

In 1960, the [[Colleges of William & Mary]], a short-lived five campus university system, was founded. It included the College of William & Mary, the [[Richmond Professional Institute]], the [[Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary]], [[Christopher Newport College]], and [[Richard Bland College]].<ref name="CoWMAH">{{cite book|last=Godson|title=The College of William and Mary: A History|year=1993|publisher=King and Queen Press|isbn=0-9615670-4-X|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It was dissolved in 1962.

In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed [[Ash Lawn-Highland]], the {{convert|535|acre|km2|sing=on}} historic [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] estate of alumnus and U.S. President [[James Monroe]], to the College. The College restored this historic presidential home near Charlottesville and opened it to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashlawnhighland.org/ |title=Ash Lawn-Highland, Home of James Monroe |publisher=Ashlawnhighland.org |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>

On July 25, 2012, [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] (EVMS), in nearby [[Norfolk, VA]] made a joint announcement with The College that the two schools are considering merging so that EVMS would become the William & Mary School of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2012/wm-and-evms-to-explore-school-of-medicine.php | title= W&M and EVMS to explore School of Medicine | last=Whitson | first=Brian | publisher=The College of William & Mary | date=July 25, 2012 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/announcements/archive/2012/presidents-message-on-wm-and-evms.php | title=President's message on W&M and EVMS | last=Reveley | first=Taylor | publisher=The College of William & Mary | date=July 25, 2012 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref> Any such merger would have to be confirmed by the two schools and then confirmed by the Virginia General Assembly and Governor. A pilot relationship, supported by $200,000 grant in the Virginia budget, was subsequently agreed upon by both universities to examine this possible union in reality.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2013/wm-report-recommends-pilot-partnership-with-evms123.php | title=W&M report recommends pilot partnership with EVMS | last=Whitson | first=Brian | publisher=The College of William & Mary | date=January 16, 2013 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref>

==Campus==
The College is located on a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named William & Mary one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/24|title="America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)|work=Travel + Leisure|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>

The [[Wren Building|Sir Christopher Wren Building]] is both the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&ResourceType=Building |title=Wren Building, College of William and Mary |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}</ref> The building, colloquially referred to as the "Wren Building", was so named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated that the 1699 design was "first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren" and then was adapted "by the Gentlemen there" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The College's Alumni Association recently published an article suggesting that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Did Wren Design the Building and William and Mary Bearing His Name? |first=Chiles T.A. |last=Larson |journal=William & Mary |page=59 |date=Fall 2005 |volume=71 |issue=1

|accessdate=2015-04-14}}</ref>  A follow-up letter clarified the apocryphal nature of the Wren connection.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known unofficially as "Ancient Campus": the [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton]] (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732).  In addition to the "Ancient Campus," which dates to the 18th century, the College also consists of "Old Campus" and "New Campus."

"Old Campus" consists of academic buildings and dormitories built in close proximity to the Wren Building and match the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and Anglo-Dutch architecture of the colonial buildings of "Ancient Campus" and [[Colonial Williamsburg]].  Located directly to the west of the Wren Building, the majority of "Old Campus" was constructed during the 1920s and 1930s and is dominated by the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Gardens]] and the College's football stadium, [[Zable Stadium]].  Also located within "Old Campus" are Sorority Court, the majority of upperclassmen dormitories, and the offices and classrooms of the History, Philosophy, Religion, Music, Modern Language, and English Departments.

Adjoining "Old Campus" to the north and west is "New Campus." It was constructed primarily between 1950 and 1980, and it consists of academic buildings and dormitories that, while of the same brick construction as "Old Campus," fit into the vernacular of modern architecture.  Beginning with the College's [[tercentenary]] in 1993, the College has embarked on a building and renovation program that favors the traditional architectural style of "Old Campus," while incorporating energy-efficient technologies.  Several buildings constructed since the 1990s have been [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED certified]].  Additionally, as the buildings of "New Campus" are renovated after decades of use, several have been remodeled to incorporate more traditional architectural elements in an effort to unify the appearance of the entire College campus. "New Campus" is dominated by [[William and Mary Hall]], [[Earl Gregg Swem Library]], and [[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]].  It also includes the offices and classrooms of the Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Departments, the majority of freshman dormitories, the fraternity complex, and the majority of the College's athletic fields. The newest addition to "New Campus" is [[Alan B. Miller Hall]], the headquarters of the College's [[Mason School of Business]].

[[File:William and mary lake matoaka ampitheater september 2011.jpeg|thumb|The renovated Matoaka Amphitheater scenically located on the shore of Lake Matoaka.]]

The recent wave of construction at William and Mary has resulted in a new building for the School of Education, located not far from William and Mary Hall.  Additionally, new facilities have freed up space in existing structures.  The offices and classrooms of the Government, Economics, and Classical Language Departments, which currently share a building on "New Campus" (Morton Hall), could potentially be separated and some relocated to vacant buildings recently renovated within the "Old Campus".

The vast majority of William and Mary's {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} consists of woodlands and [[Lake Matoaka]], a man-made lake created by colonists in the early 18th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |title=Facts about Lake Matoaka |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=May 16, 2011 }}</ref>  The College has shown a dedication to the stewardship and preservation of these natural elements, which are accessible via the trails running throughout the campus.

The College also has property and buildings not contiguous to campus, including the [[The College of William & Mary Law School|William and Mary School of Law]] and the [[McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center]], both located on a piece of property approximately four blocks southeast of the Wren Building.  Additionally, approximately a mile northwest of "New Campus" is the Dillard Complex (located across from the modern campus of Virginia's [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)|Eastern State Hospital]]), which is home to several offices, two former dormitories, and [[Plumeri Park]], the College's baseball stadium.

The Board elects a Rector, Vice Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually.<ref name="FH"/> The Board is responsible for appointing a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools, and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the College's property and finances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/bov/members/index.php |title=Members of the Board |publisher=Board of Visitors, The College of William & Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}</ref>

The [[Chancellor of the College of William and Mary]] is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or the [[Bishop of London]], who served as the College’s advocate to the crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General [[George Washington]] was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President [[John Tyler]] held the post. The College has recently had a number of distinguished chancellors: former [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[Warren E. Burger]] (1986–1993), former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1993–2000), former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (2000–2005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (2005–2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/duties/index.php |title=Duties and History, Chancellor |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}</ref> Former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert M.

===Honor system===
[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|upright|thumb|Thomas Jefferson]]
William & Mary's [[Honor code|honor system]] was first established by alumnus [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation's first.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/education/edlife/notebook.html?scp=1&sq=college%20of%20william%20and%20mary&st=nyt |title=And Out of the Corner of My Eye... – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |author=Patricia R. Olsen |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>  During the orientation week, every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the [[Wren Building]] pledging:
:''As a Member of the William & Mary community I pledge, on my Honor, not to lie, cheat, or steal in either my academic or personal life. I understand that such acts violate the Honor Code and undermine the community of trust of which we are all stewards.''

The basis of W&M's Honor Pledge was written over 150 years ago by alumnus and law professor [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000398 |title=Tucker, Henry St. George, (1780–1848) |publisher=Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}</ref>  While teaching law at the [[University of Virginia]], Tucker proposed that students attach a pledge to all exams confirming that on their honor they did not receive any assistance.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Barefoot  | first = Coy  | authorlink =   | title = The Evolution of Honor: Enduring Principle, Changing Times  | journal = The University of Virginia Magazine  | volume = 97  | issue = 1  | pages = 22–27  | publisher = University of Virginia Alumni Assn.   | location = Charlottesville, VA  | date = Spring 2008  | url = http://www.uvamagazine.org/site/c.esJNK1PIJrH/b.3888025/  | doi =   | id =   | accessdate = March 4, 2008  | format =  – <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ABarefoot+intitle%3AThe+Evolution+of+Honor%3A+Enduring+Principle%2C+Changing+Times&as_publication=The+University+of+Virginia+Magazine&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}} {{Dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last= Smith| first= C.

===Traditions===
[[File:Crimdell.jpg|thumb|left|Crim Dell bridge in the heart of W&M's wooded campus]]
William & Mary has a number of traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as [[Santa Claus]] and reads a rendition of "[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]", the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads "Twas the Night Before Finals," and [[The Gentlemen of the College]] sing the song "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |title=12/1/2004 – Holiday Traditions Fill The Season In Williamsburg – Travel – Chattanoogan.com |publisher=Chattanoogan.com |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>  Christmas is a grand celebration at the College; decorated Christmas trees abound on campus.  This popular tradition in fact started when German immigrant Charles Minnegerode, a humanities professor at the College in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America. Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor [[St. George Tucker]], thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 Minnigerode, Charles (1814–1894)]. Encyclopedia Virginia. Retrieved on 2013-08-09.</ref>

Incoming freshmen participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the College. Freshmen also have the opportunity, during orientation week, to serenade the President of the College at his home with the [[Our Alma Mater|Alma Mater song]]. The Senior Walk is similar, in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building in their "departure" from the College. On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.

One unofficial tradition is the Triathlon, a set of three tasks completed by many students prior to graduation. These include jumping the wall of the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] in [[Colonial Williamsburg]] after hours (and if so inclined, running through the Boxwood Maze to the Palace itself), streaking through the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Garden]], and swimming in the [[Crim Dell bridge|Crim Dell]] pond.

William and Mary also takes pride in their connections to their colonial past during Charter Day festivities. Charter Day is technically February 8, based on the date (from the [[Julian Calendar]]) that the Reverend James Blair, first President of The College received the charter from the Court of [[William and Mary]] at Kensington Palace in 1693. Past Charter Day speakers have included former US President [[John Tyler]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Robert Gates]].

A unique tradition at William and Mary is the annual Raft Debate. Described by The College as "...a 'delicate balance of comedy and lecture,' the annual Raft Debate features four W&M faculty members from diverse disciplines, stranded on a desolate island with only a one-person life raft for escape to civilization. Based on the volume of applause, the audience chooses the sole survivor as the professors cajole, plead, pontificate, and resort shamelessly to props and costumes. The quirky event originated in the mid-1900s and was revived during the 2000s by the Graduate Center, the A&S Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the A&S Graduate Student Association.  Faculty participants represent the Humanities, the Social Sciences, or the Natural and Computational Sciences.  The Devil’s Advocate, who argues sarcastically that none of the academic disciplines are worth saving, has on rare occasion emerged victoriously."

Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus, crossing the Crim Dell bridge, and arriving at William & Mary Hall for the commencement ceremony.  The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William & Mary sings the [[William & Mary Hymn]].

===Fraternities and sororities===

Today, Greek organizations play an important role in the College community, along with other social organizations (e.g. theatre and club sports organizations). Overall, about one-third of its undergraduates are active members of 17 national fraternities and 14 sororities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/greeks/who-we-are/chapters/index.php |title=Chapters |publisher=Wm.edu |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>  William & Mary is also home to several unique non-Greek social fraternities, notably the Nu Kappa Epsilon music sorority<ref>{{cite web

==Athletics==

{{Main|William & Mary Tribe}}
Formerly known as the "Indians," William & Mary's athletic teams are now known as the "Tribe". The College fields [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field. In addition, there are women's field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball squads as well as men's baseball and football. In the 2004–05 season, the Tribe garnered five [[Colonial Athletic Association]] titles, and it leads the conference with over 80 titles. In that same year, several teams competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championships, with the football team appearing in the [[Division I-AA]] national semifinals. The men's cross country team finished 8th and 5th at the Division I [[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship]] in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The William & Mary men's basketball team is one of five original Division I schools that has never been to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.

There have been many recent notable athletes who competed for the Tribe. On the men's soccer team, goalkeeper [[Adin Brown]] was a back-to-back [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|NCAA First Team All-American]] in 1998 and 1999. The track program has produced several [[All-America]]ns, including Brian Hyde, an [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and collegiate record holder in the [[1500 metres|1500-meter run]], and Ed Moran, a gold medalist in the [[5000 metres|5000-meter run]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]]. The baseball program boasts a handful of current [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players, including relief pitcher [[Bill Bray]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] organization, 11 year MLB career Curtis Pride [[Montreal Expos]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and [[Colorado Rockies]] utility infielder [[Brendan Harris]]. The [[William & Mary Tribe football|football program]] has also produced numerous [[National Football League|NFL]] players and coaches: All-Pro safety [[Darren Sharper]], current [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] head coach [[Mike Tomlin]], cornerback [[Derek Cox]], kicker [[Steve Christie]], long snapper [[Mike Leach (long snapper)|Mike Leach]], [[Walter Payton Award]]-winning quarterback [[Lang Campbell]], wide receiver [[Dominique Thompson]], [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coaches [[Marv Levy]] and [[Lou Holtz]], and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]].

In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment that is offensive to the American Indian community. The College's appeal regarding the use of the institution’s athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The "Tribe" nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5338 |title=‘Tribe’ refers to community Nichol states in a report sent to the NCAA &#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> The College stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007, although they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6870 |title=William and Mary to change athletic logo before Fall 2007 &#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> Some students{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} have vowed to display the prior logo on their own at NCAA post-season games. A new design was unveiled in December 2007.

For a short time, the College's unofficial mascot was a [[Growling Grass Frog|green and gold frog]] (though it was commonly referred to on campus simply as an 'amorphous green blob') called "[[Colonel Ebirt]]" ("Tribe" backwards), which was discontinued in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.wm.edu/news/archive/index.php?id=5246 |title='&#39;Eulogy for Ebirt:'&#39; Lessons from one of the Tribe’s great fans &#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>  Prior to that, two students, one male, one female, dressed in buckskins. The female was referred to as Pocohontas, while the male was usually referred to as "tribe guy." The practice ended around 1991.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Subsequently, a selection process was conducted to select the College's new mascot. In December 2009, five finalists – including a [[Griffin]], [[William and Mary|King and Queen]], the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], a [[Pug]] and the [[Wren]] – were announced from more than 800 submissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2009/mascot-committee-unveils-five-finalists-123.php|title=William & Mary                          - Mascot Committee unveils five finalists|work=wm.edu}}</ref>  On April 6, 2010, President Taylor Reveley announced that the College has selected the [[Griffin (mascot)|Griffin]] as its new mascot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2010/new-mascot-announced-123.php|title=William & Mary                          - 'Get me the Griffin': William & Mary Announces New Mascot|work=wm.edu}}</ref>
