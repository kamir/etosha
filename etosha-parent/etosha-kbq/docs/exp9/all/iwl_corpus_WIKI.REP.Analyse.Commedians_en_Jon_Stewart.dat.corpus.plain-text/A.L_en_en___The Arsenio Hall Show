Both series were produced by Hall's production company, Arsenio Hall Communications. The original series was produced and distributed by [[Paramount Domestic Television]] and taped at [[Paramount Studios]] in Los Angeles, California. The second series was shot at [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|Sunset Bronson Studios]] and was produced by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], Octagon Entertainment, and Eye Productions; it was distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Bill|last=Carter|date=September 8, 2013 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/arts/television/arsenio-hall-show-returns-after-a-nearly-20-year-hiatus.html?pagewanted=all |title=Familiar Night Bird Reclaims a Perch}}</ref>

==First series (1989–1994)==

===Background===
Hall had been a host on ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'', another talk show on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], after the dismissal of [[Joan Rivers]]. He was given a 13-week run, during which he became unexpectedly popular.  During the [[monologue]] of his final appearance as host, Hall stated that the reason he had agreed to only do 13 weeks was because that was as long as he was able to stay, as he had plans "to do other things."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRf5742rRr8 |title=The Late Show with Arsenio Hall: Final Show |publisher=YouTube |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>  He subsequently began working on the [[Eddie Murphy]] [[Star vehicle|vehicle]] ''[[Coming to America]]''. He ultimately signed with [[Paramount Television]] before Fox finally decided, too late, that they wanted to keep him.<ref>{{cite news|title= We Be Havin' a Ball, Says Arsenio Hall. But Can the Talk-Show Host's Hip New Style Succeed on Late-Night TV?|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=April 16, 1989|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-16/magazine/tm-2132_1_arsenio-hall-cher-tonight-show|accessdate=October 9, 2010|first=Itabari|last=Njeri}}</ref> Hall had a fairly long connection with Paramount before this, having been the in-house comedian on Paramount's weekly music series ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' for several years and serving as a co-host for its final two years.

''Arsenio'' was one of two late-night shows to premiere in 1989.  The other was ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'', hosted by longtime ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' host [[Pat Sajak]].  However, Hall had two things working in his favor; his prior late-night hosting experience when compared with Sajak's lack of emceeing outside of his ''Wheel'' duties, and the fact that his show was to premiere exactly one week before Sajak's to give him a head start.  While Hall's show became a near-instant hit, Sajak's show was a ratings flop, and was canceled after a little more than a year.

===Recurring features and gags===
[[Burton Richardson (announcer)|Burton Richardson]]'s long intro of the show's host (in which he holds the letter ''O'' in "Arsenio" for as long as ten seconds right before Hall came out onto the stage, and then in the same breath, immediately announced "HALL!") is a staple of the show. In the intro to the final episode, Richardson held his one-breath introduction for exactly twenty seconds, one of the few times he had done so. While being introduced (and as seen on show titles/[[Promo (media)|promos]]), Arsenio stood with his head down, hands together and legs apart, in the shape of the letter "A".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fox40.com/2013/09/06/arsenio-halls-show-coming-to-fox40-this-fall/ |title=Arsenio Hall's Show Coming to FOX40 this Fall – KTXL FOX40 |publisher=Fox40.com |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

One of the show's recurrent themes was affixing a humorous label to a section of the studio audience in rows behind/near the band, called the "Dog Pound".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Arsenio-Hall-Interview-1070082.aspx |title=Arsenio Hall on Carson, Leno and Why He's Coming Back to Late Night – Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=September 9, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> Members of the "Dog Pound" jubilantly interacted with Hall, standing up and making a pumping, whirling motion with their raised fists and howling "Wuff, Wuff, Wuff". The labeling was a staple of Hall's opening monologue and almost always began with the phrase "Those are people who...." In one variation of Hall ridiculing the "Dog Pound" with some offbeat statement which simultaneously appeared over the screen, Hall designated the section as "People who are currently in a [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]]", at which point a camera pans over to that section to reveal a digitally [[Pixilation|pixilated]] view of the audience that made it impossible to identify them.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/fans_dogpound.htm |title=Fans & Fanatics > The Dogpound (The Arsenio Hall Show) |publisher=Tv Acres |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>

A frequent joke in Hall's opening monologue suggested that he still lives in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and drives himself to [[Los Angeles]] every day to host the show. While on these alleged long drives, Hall ponders certain thoughts, referring to them as "things that make you go hmmm...." The running gag inspired a 1991 [[C+C Music Factory]] song by the same title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.song-database.com/chhist.php?sid=15844&from=spu&type=ht |title=Things That Make You Go Hmmmmmm? |publisher=Song-database.com |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref> "[[Things That Make You Go Hmmm...]]" reached #1 on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Billboard Hot Dance Club Play]] chart and #4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.

===Cultural influence===
''The Arsenio Hall Show'' was aimed primarily at, although not limited to, the younger [[Urban culture|urban]] audience.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/hall-521799-night-late.html |title=Orange County Register |publisher=Ocregister.com |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> [[Eddie Murphy]] (a personal friend of Hall's), [[George Lopez]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/09/03/arsenio-goes-back-to-the-future-with-first-week-guests/2760371/ |title=Arsenio goes back to the future with first-week guests |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |first1=Bill |last1=Keveney}}</ref> and other performers were often featured, such as semi-regular guests including [[Andrew "Dice" Clay]] and [[Paula Abdul]]. The show quickly appealed to young people of all races and began to attract a wide variety of guests not common on other talk shows<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-06-29/features/8902130401_1_pat-sajak-show-arsenio-hall-show-talk |title=Arsenio Hall Pulls Ahead In The New-guy Race – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=June 29, 1989 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |first=Rick |last=Kogan}}</ref> (although this popularity with audiences was short-lived and ultimately led to the show's cancellation). It became the show for entertainers to go to in order to reach the "[[MTV Generation]]".<ref>{{cite news | first=Donna | last=Britt |url=| title=Arsenio Hall, On a Late-Night Mission; Targeting the MTV Generation, & Gaining on Carson | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 10, 1989 }}</ref> The show was commonly dubbed a "Night Thing" and reflected a party or [[nightclub]] theme.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite news|author=Adam Sandler |url=http://variety.com/1993/tv/reviews/arsenio-hall-the-1-000th-show-1200432243/ |title=Arsenio Hall: The 1,000th Show |publisher=Variety |date=May 17, 1993 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

Hall's friend [[MC Hammer|M.C. Hammer]] was also a frequent interview and musical guest. Additionally, Hall interviewed "[[Jason Voorhees]]", the main character from the popular ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series of films around the time of the release of ''[[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yOZsZuxMY |title=Jason Voorhees on talk show |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> [[Muppets]] creator [[Jim Henson]] also appeared on the show 12 days before his death in May 1990, marking one of Henson's last public appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1-PwZltH8E |title=Jim Henson on Arsenio Hall |publisher=YouTube |date=June 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Hall often featured [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] wrestlers, like [[Hulk Hogan]] (who first denied using [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] on the program), [[Ravishing Rick Rude]] (who made a special set of tights with Hall's face on the back) with [[Bobby Heenan]], [[Randy Savage]], [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]], the [[Ray Traylor|Big Bossman]], and [[George Gray (wrestler)|Akeem]] with [[Ken Johnson (wrestling)|Slick]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]].

The show was known for the audience's chant of "Woof! Woof! Woof!" while pumping their fists in a circular motion. According to [[TV Acres]], the "Wuff, Wuff" sound was based on howlings used at [[Cleveland Browns]] (aka "The Dogs") football games, in Hall's hometown.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Others{{Who|{{November 2013}}|date=November 2013}} have speculated that it came from the chant of [[List of African-American Greek and fraternal organizations|Black Greek Letter Organization]] [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity. It quickly became associated with the show and with Hall himself (as well as a [[popular culture|pop culture]] reference).<ref>{{cite news|last=Newcomb |first=Tim |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/31/woof-woof-arsenio-hall-returning-to-late-night-television/ |title=Woof!

Hall was also well known for his long fingers, which he would often use to point at the audience; [[Michael Wolff]] led the [[house band]] which Hall called "Posse."

===Queer Nation incident===
During a May 1991 taping, three or four members of Queer Nation, seated in the back row in different sections of the audience, interrupted Hall's opening monologue demanding to know why he never had any gay guests on the show. Hall's initial answer was that since most of the guests were not open about their sexuality, neither Hall nor the producers knew whether they were gay or not.

When the protesters voiced their offense because the show failed to book filmmaker [[Gus Van Sant]] (whose ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' was in production at the time) or actor [[Harvey Fierstein]], Hall defended the show by saying that [[Elton John]] had been a guest. Increasingly infuriated, Hall added that he booked guests due to his interest in what they were working on at the time, not because of their sexual preference (specifically, in the case of Fierstein, saying that if he was doing something that Hall found interesting, he would definitely book him as a guest). The heated exchange<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxGQzs22K3s |title=Arsenio goes off on Queer Nation |publisher=YouTube |date=July 13, 2007 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> went on for several minutes, and Hall continued to defend himself as both a comedian and a host, pointing out that he also had gay friends, and that a person's sexual preference was really nobody else's business. Fierstein eventually did become a guest on the show months later.

===Bill Clinton===
In June 1992, then-[[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was a guest on the show, playing "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]" on the  [[saxophone]] (causing Arsenio to quip, "It's nice to see a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] blow something besides the election"). The appearance is often considered an important moment in Clinton's political career, helping build his popularity among minority and young voters. Clinton went on to win the [[United States presidential election, 1992|election]] in November 1992.<ref>{{cite news|title= The 1992 Campaign: Media; Whistle-Stops a la 1992: Arsenio, Larry and Phil|work= The New York Times|date=June 5, 1992|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1061EF93A550C768CDDAF0894DA494D81|accessdate=October 9, 2010|first=Elizabeth|last=Kolbert}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Road warriors|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Road+warriors.-a013318850|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=[[Washington Monthly]]|date=January 1, 1993|publisher=The Free Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Clinton Plays It Cool|work= Time|date=June 15, 1992|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975751,00.html|accessdate=October 9, 2010|first=Walter|last=Shapiro}}</ref>

The popularity of the former president's appearance on the show was rekindled on June 6, 2012, when a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of his iconic sax solo, set to the tune of [[M83 (band)|M83]]'s "[[Midnight City]]", was uploaded to [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite news|title=ILL CLINTON|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=433-nmcWw8E|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> The [[Viral video|video went viral]] and instantly generated [[Marketing buzz|publicity]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hipster Runoff|url=http://hipsterrunoff.com/node/8455|publisher=Hipsterrunoff.com|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Vulture|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/watch-bill-clinton-play-m83.html|publisher=Vulture.com|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gawker|url=http://gawker.com/5923190/this-mashup-of-bill-clinton-and-m83-is-the-best-mashup-of-bill-clinton-and-m83|publisher=Gawker.com|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>

===Ratings decline and cancellation===
The program remained popular into 1993, but as the year went on, Hall and Paramount began having [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] problems due in large part to the premiere of three late-night series before the year was out. At the end of the 1992–93 season one of Hall's strongest bases consisted of [[CBS]] affiliates. At the time, CBS did not offer much in the way of late night programming other than its [[Crimetime After Primetime|nightly crime drama rerun block]] and its overnight newscast ''CBS News Nightwatch'' (later replaced by ''[[Up to the Minute]]'') and had not offered a late-night variety program since ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'', which premiered exactly one week after Hall launched his show, was cancelled in 1990. Among the CBS stations that aired ''Arsenio'' at the time were [[WJW-TV]], then the network's affiliate in Hall's hometown of Cleveland; [[WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], a station owned by [[Gannett Company]]; and [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]], one of the network's [[owned-and-operated station]]s. Many of these stations picked up Hall's show to fill the void left by Sajak's cancellation. Another prominent group of stations that carried the program were affiliates of the still-young Fox, many of which picked up ''Arsenio'' to fill the gaps left when ''The Late Show'', which never was able to find an audience, was finally canceled in 1988. This included [[WTXF-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], a station that Paramount [[Paramount Stations Group|acquired in 1991]].

In the summer of 1993, [[David Letterman]], who had spent over 13 years at [[NBC]] and the previous 11 as the host of the popular post-''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' program ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'', left the network due to his dissatisfaction with being passed over as host of ''The Tonight Show'' after the retirement of [[Johnny Carson]] in favor of [[Jay Leno]]. Letterman signed with CBS to do a late-night program which would compete head-to-head with ''The Tonight Show'',<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Arsenio Hall Show' Given Pink Slip After Low Ratings|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 19, 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-19/business/fi-47760_1_arsenio-hall-show|accessdate=June 3, 2012|first=John|last=Lippman}}</ref> and which would also compete with Hall's program.  Unlike the situation that prevailed when he was competing against Sajak, Hall was now up against one of the most popular hosts in late night television.  Several CBS stations, including WBBM, dropped Hall's show when ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' debuted in August. Most, if not all, of the rest dropped Hall when Letterman's show became a runaway hit (WUSA was one of the exceptions, having rebuffed an edict by CBS for all of its affiliates to clear the ''Late Show'' at the normal network time for their respective time zones). ''Arsenio'' also found itself losing some of its audience to cable as [[MTV]] launched a daily thirty minute late-night program that was hosted by comedian [[Jon Stewart]], which became popular in its own right.

Subsequently, Fox decided to get back into the late night television battle after several years, despite ''Arsenio'' drawing solid ratings on many of its affiliates. In September 1993, the network premiered ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' running directly against Hall, Leno and Letterman. Fox demanded that all of its affiliates air Chase's show, leading the Fox stations airing ''Arsenio'' to either drop the series or relocate it to a less desirable time slot. Although ''The Chevy Chase Show'' was a critical and ratings flop and left the air after only five weeks, the stations that ''Arsenio'' had been or was still airing on were not immediately inclined to move it back, which caused more of a dip in the ratings.

On February 7, 1994, Hall announced that he would be featuring controversial [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]]. He had also booked gospel singer [[Kirk Franklin]] and his singing group The Family for the show as well and promised that he would give them both equal time on the show, which was to air eighteen days following the announcement, as he had drawn criticism for even considering booking Farrakhan as a guest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Louis Farrakhan to appear on 'The Arsenio Hall Show' Friday, Feb. 25; Popular gospel group 'The Kirk Franklin Family' also scheduled to perform|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LOUIS+FARRAKHAN+TO+APPEAR+ON+%27THE+ARSENIO+HALL+SHOW%27+FRIDAY,+FEB.+25%3B...-a014781800|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=[[PR Newswire]]|date=February 7, 1994}}</ref> Instead, nearly the entire show was devoted to Hall interviewing Farrakhan and he received widespread criticism for conducting what was considered too "soft" of an interview.<ref name="rosenberg">{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard|title=Arsenio Hall vs. Louis Farrakhan: It's a Rout|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-28/entertainment/ca-28353_1_arsenio-hall|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 28, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Braxton|first=Greg|title=Farrakhan Appearance on 'Arsenio' Sparks Furor|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-25/entertainment/ca-27285_1_louis-farrakhan|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 25, 1994}}</ref> This triggered yet another ratings slide from which the show never recovered, with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' citing a twenty-four percent drop from 1992-93 to 1993-94.

Although Paramount did say publicly that the show was not in imminent danger of cancellation, Hall announced on April 18, 1994 that he was not going to continue the show, simply saying "it's time".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-19/business/fi-47760_1_arsenio-hall-show |title='Arsenio Hall Show' Given Pink Slip After Low Ratings : Television: Some network affiliates swung away from syndicated program when David Letterman joined CBS. - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1994-01-28 |accessdate=2014-02-27 |first=John |last=Lippman}}</ref> The final episode aired on May 29, 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenio Hall Quits Late-Night Show|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/19/arts/arsenio-hall-quits-late-night-show.html?src=pm|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 19, 1994}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
Shortly before ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' was canceled, [[Paramount Television|Paramount]]'s merger with [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] was finalized. Since this now meant that Paramount and MTV were corporate siblings, there was a ready-made replacement for ''Arsenio'' and after a retooling and expansion, a syndicated version of ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' was launched in late 1994. Despite being sold to most of the same ''Arsenio'' affiliates, ''The Jon Stewart Show'' was never able to find an audience in syndication as it had on MTV and the show was canceled after one season.

After the decline of ''Arsenio'' and the failure of ''The Jon Stewart Show'', Paramount did not make another attempt at producing a late-night variety show. Nonetheless, they were not willing to give up on the idea fully and in 1998, Paramount developed a daytime variety show for comedian [[Howie Mandel]]. ''[[The Howie Mandel Show]]'' premiered in May 1998, but could not find an audience in what was then a syndicated landscape saturated with talk shows, and Paramount canceled the show in early 1999. Paramount subsequently gave up on the variety format altogether and did not attempt it again before its television operations were folded into those of CBS.

==Second series (2013—2014)==
In May 2012, Hall was said to be shopping around an idea for a new late-night program and had garnered interest from Fox and [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] as to picking the show up. On June 18, 2012, Hall announced that he had brokered a deal with CBS Television Distribution and Tribune Broadcasting to bring his late-night talk show back to television.<ref>{{cite news|author=June 18, 2012 5:47 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/18/arsenio-hall-talk-show_n_1607101.html |title=Arsenio Hall Gets New Syndicated Late-Night Talk Show, Slated For Fall 2013 |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL_1amsoK4M |title=The Party is Back! |publisher=YouTube |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Although the show was agreed upon in time for the 2012–13 season, the agreement was to see ''Arsenio'' return at the beginning of the next season.

In a 2012 interview with ''[[Essence Magazine]]'', Hall stated that he would like to interview [[Mariah Carey]], as she only appeared as a featured performer on his show.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ashley Majeski |url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/arsenio-hall-his-return-late-night-ive-got-get-my-8C10990051 |title=Arsenio Hall on his return to late night: I've got to 'get my hustle on' |publisher=TODAY.com |date=August 23, 2013 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>

The revived ''Arsenio'' debuted on September 9, 2013. Stations that also carried Hall's original program, such as CBS-owned station [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and [[CFMT-DT]] in Toronto, have picked up the revived series as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/486079-Arsenio_Hall_Returning_to_Late_Night.php |title=Arsenio Hall Returning to Late-Night – June 18, 2012 21:15:44 &#124; Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/arsenio-hall-getting-night-talk-show-fox-tbs-221413196.html |title=Arsenio Hall Getting New Talk Show – Fox & TBS Are Interested |date=May 21, 2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2012/05/21/arsenio-hall-talk-show-host-celebrity-apprentice-winner-2012-tv-comeback/ |title=Arsenio Hall Show Return? – ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ Winner’s TV Comeback |publisher=Hollywood Life |date=May 21, 2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Tribune-owned stations airing ''Arsenio'' included [[KTLA]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[KDAF]] in [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[WPIX]] in [[New York City]], [[WGN-TV]] in [[Chicago]], [[KCPQ]] in [[Seattle]] and [[WDCW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The show also aired on [[CBS Television Stations|CBS]]-owned stations.

Unlike Hall's previous show, this version is taped at the [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|Sunset Bronson Studios]] in [[Hollywood]],<ref>{{cite web|title='Arsenio Hall Show' to Tape at Sunset Bronson Studios|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/493081-_Arsenio_Hall_Show_to_Tape_at_Sunset_Bronson_Studios.php|work=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}</ref> whose lot houses KTLA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/arsenio_s_in_the_house/12534/ |title=Arsenio's in the House |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> As with the original series, Hall now refers to his [[house band]] as "The Posse 2.0" which consists of [[Robin DiMaggio]] as the music leader/director and drummer, Alex Al on bass, Rob Bacon on guitar, Sean Holt on saxophone and Victoria Theodore on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/136472_EXCLUSIVE_Meet_Arsenio_Hall_s_Posse_20/index.html |title=EXCLUSIVE: Meet Arsenio Hall's Posse 2.0 |publisher=ETonline.com |date=April 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/arsenio-hall-show/ |title=The Arsenio Hall Show |publisher=TV.com |date=September 9, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, Hall's open-[[monologue]] still mostly consists of jokes about current events.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/21/aresenio-hall-oprah-feud_n_4125372.html |title=Arsenio Hall And Oprah Set The Record Straight On Their '90s 'Feud' (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |first=Lynn |last=Okura}}</ref> Hall ends each show by saying, "I'll see you in 23 hours."<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/arsenio-hall-show-late/ |title='The Arsenio Hall Show,' too late |publisher=Media Life Magazine |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

In another notable difference from Hall's previous show, Diana Steele's intro to the show's host (which she holds the "O" in "Arsenio" for a long as five seconds right before Hall comes out onto the stage, and then in the same breath, finally/immediately announces, "HALL!") is also a staple of the show.

In mid-October, executive producer Neal Kendeall stepped down due to creative differences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/the-arsenio-hall-show-exec-producer-neal-kendall-out-1200695713/ |title=‘The Arsenio Hall Show’ Exec Producer Neal Kendall Exits |publisher=Variety |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> The senior VP of programming and development, Eric Pankowski, took over while Hall conducted a search for a new show-runner, in an effort to revamp the show and boost ratings.<ref>[http://www.philasun.com/news/4761/38/The-Arsenio-Hall-Show-Makes-Major-Changes.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> Reruns were aired during the transition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philasun.com/news/4761/38/The-Arsenio-Hall-Show-Makes-Major-Changes |title=The Arsenio Hall Show Makes Major Changes |publisher=Philasun.com |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}</ref> New shows resumed the week of October 28, 2013.

During an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] in October 2013, Hall and Winfrey discussed a "feud" between the two based on jokes he told nearly 20 years earlier about her weight and Oprah's partner, [[Stedman Graham]]. During their talk on ''[[Oprah's Next Chapter]]'', Hall also mentioned his long-time friendship with [[Jay Leno]], how [[David Letterman]] was an influence on him and the [[late-night talk show]] competition in general, including [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|the 2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict]] between Leno and [[Conan O'Brien]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>{{cite web|last=Leigh |first=Victoria |url=http://tv.yahoo.com/news/arsenio-hall-oprah-night-war-185200003.html |title=Arsenio Hall to Oprah: What Late-Night War? – Yahoo TV |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date=October 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Ratings and reception===
The debut episode beat out all late night shows in [[Audience measurement|viewership]] that evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideedition.com/entertainment/6964-arsenio-hall-scores-big-in-return-to-late-night |title=arsenio-hall-scores-big-in-return-to-late-night |title=Arsenio Hall Scores Big in Return to Late Night |publisher=Insideedition.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> However, after its premiere week in September 2013, the show's record-setting [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] dropped 40% (falling from an average 1.5 rating to 0.4 with 18–49 target audiences). While ratings spiraled downward, show executives were optimistic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/11/11/sources-say-arsenio-hall-show-in-ratings-spiral-execs-think-its-right-on-track/ |title=Sources say Arsenio Hall show in a ratings spiral; execs think its right on track |publisher=Fox News |date= November 11, 2013|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

Critical reaction to the updated show were mixed since its premiere week. According to ''[[Media Life Magazine]]'', Hall's flashy,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57600874/for-arsenio-hall-back-is-beautiful/ |title=For Arsenio Hall, back is beautiful |publisher=CBS News |date=September 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> edgy and laid-back approach to late-night talk shows in the early 1990s<ref>{{cite news|last=Harrington |first=Rebecca |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/09/10/memo-to-arsenio-the-90s-were-great-but-theyre-over/ |title=Memo to Arsenio: The 90s Were Great, But They're Over &#124; TIME.com |publisher=Entertainment.time.com |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref> was having little effect on audiences after its reincarnation.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the show had much familiarity and that "Mr. Hall's return to the screen was  mostly a little sad. He is better than this and deserved a more convincing comeback."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/arts/television/arsenio-hall-show-returns-with-much-familiarity.html|title=He Looks Backward as He Goes Forward : 'Arsenio Hall Show' Returns, With Much Familiarity|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 24, 2014|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref> While also reporting Hall's talk show is similar to his original series, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a better review/reception of the revived show, stating "while he might not be the hippest guy in late-night anymore, Arsenio 2.0 can still emerge as a survivor".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/tv-review-the-arsenio-hall-show-1200601681/ |title="The Arsenio Hall Show" review |publisher=Variety |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Cancellation===
The revived ''Arsenio'' program was initially renewed for a second season on February 26, 2014; the announcement was made to that night's audience on air by Jay Leno in his first post-''[[Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show]]'' appearance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arsenio-hall-show-renewed-second-683922|title='Arsenio Hall Show' Renewed for Second Season|author=Alex Ben Block|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 26, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>
The decision was later reversed, and the program was cancelled by CBS Television Distribution and Tribune, on May 30, 2014.

==Spin-off==
In 1990, Hall decided to develop a companion program to his own as what he termed to be his show's "afterparty". This idea became ''[[The Party Machine with Nia Peeples|The Party Machine]]'', a 30-minute late night music show in the same vein as shows like ''[[Club MTV]]'' or ''[[Soul Train]]''. Hall co-produced the series with its host, singer/actress [[Nia Peeples]], and it debuted on January 7, 1991, in syndication (usually following its parent series). Although initial ratings were high, especially in its larger markets, ''The Party Machine'' began sliding in the ratings quickly and the program was canceled five months after its debut. Its final episode aired on September 15, 1991.
