Sykes' family history was researched for an episode of the 2012 PBS genealogy program ''Finding Your Roots With [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]]'' Her ancestry was traced back to a 1683 court case involving her paternal ninth great-grandmother Elizabeth Banks, a free white woman and indentured servant, who gave birth to a biracial child Mary Banks fathered by a slave, who inherited her mother's free status. According to historian [[Ira Berlin]], a specialist in the history of American slavery, the Sykes family history is "... the only such case that I know of in which it is possible to trace a black family rooted in freedom from the late 17th century to the present."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/arts/television/wanda-sykes-finds-ancestors-thanks-to-henry-louis-gates-jr.html |title=Family Tree’s Startling Roots |date=March 19, 2012 |work=The New York Times |author=Felicia R.
