==Career==

===Music===
In 1983, during his final year as a student at UCL (University College London), Gervais and college friend [[Bill Macrae]] formed the [[New wave music|new wave]] pop [[Musical ensemble|duo]], [[Seona Dancing]]. They were signed by [[London Records]], which released two of their singles—"[[More to Lose]]" and "[[Bitter Heart (song)|Bitter Heart]]". Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in the [[Philippines]] with "More to Lose".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/26/ricky_gervais_pop_band/|title=Ricky Gervais' career as an 80's glam-pop star|work=Salon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> He also worked as the manager for [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before they became successful in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a321491/brett-anderson-praises-ex-manager-ricky-gervais.html#~p2t6TtO7XcwBvE|title=Brent Anderson Praises Ex-manager Ricky Gervais|work=Digitalspy|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as [[David Brent]] along with a band under the name "Foregone Conclusion". Gervais and the band performed songs written under the Brent character including songs such as "Equality Street" and "[[Free Love Freeway]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/73215 |title=Ricky Gervais plays debut David Brent show with former Razorlight star in London |work=[[NME]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

===Radio===
Gervais later worked as an [[event management|assistant events manager]] for the [[University of London Union]] (ULU), then moved from ULU to a job as head of speech at the alternative radio station Xfm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/comedy/2010/12/ricky-gervais-ince-office|title=Ricky Gervais: They Call Me Entertainment|work=Newstatesman|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Needing an assistant, Gervais interviewed the first person whose ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' he saw.

After the first series of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', Gervais and Merchant returned to Xfm in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show. This was when the pair first worked with [[Karl Pilkington]], who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of [[podcast]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/5930/ricky-gervais-and-stephen-merchant-return-to-xfm|title=Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Return to Xfm|work=Gigwise |accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>

====Podcast====

{{See also|List of The Ricky Gervais Show episodes}}
On 5 December 2005 ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' began offering free weekly [[podcast]]s - [[The Ricky Gervais Show]] featuring Gervais, Merchant, and [[Karl Pilkington]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4479230.stm|title=Gervais radio show to be podcast |date= 28 November 2005|work=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Throughout January and February 2006 the podcast was consistently ranked the number-one podcast in the world; it appeared in the 2007 [[Guinness World Record]] for the world's most-downloaded podcast, having gained an average of 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month. Two more series—-each with six podcasts—-were released between February and September 2006.

In late 2006 three more free podcasts were released. Together called "The Podfather Trilogy", they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Podfather-Trilogy-Season-Gervais/dp/B002SPXUZC|title=The Podfather Trilogy|work=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> These three were known by Ricky and Steve as "The Fourth Season".  In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes; this podcast was originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais's Fame tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free full-length podcast, which lasted just over an hour.

In August 2008 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded their fifth season of audiobooks, totalling 4 chapters, which were released on 16 September 2008. These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 "Guides" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law & Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[World Cup 2010]] & [[Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|work=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.

===Television===

===Early television appearances===
[[File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg|thumb|upright|Gervais at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2007]]
Gervais has contributed to the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s "Comedy Lab" series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]–obsessed character called Clive Meadows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=Rollingstone|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> 
Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself. '[[The Guardian|''The Guardian'''s]] Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with ''Extras'', "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and Darren ([[Stephen Merchant]]), and the apparent parody of this style with ''When The Whistle Blows'', and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely [[stereotype]]d gay couple".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/sep/22/extrasworkneededricky|title=Extras work needed, Ricky?|first=Chris |last=Tryhorn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>
Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavare]] Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais

===''The Office''===
{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}
''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he chose to make a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from [[Ash Atalla]], who was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss', thus [[David Brent]] was created, Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC's Head of Entertainment [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], who then passed it on to Head of Comedy [[Jon Plowman]], who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais
|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

The first six-episode series of ''The Office'' aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/people/ricky-gervais/AA3l0x9|title=Ricky Gervais| work=Msn.com|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> Word-of-mouth, repeats, and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015}}</ref>

''[[The Office]]'' brand has since been remade for audiences in [[:sv:Kontoret|Sweden]], [[Le Bureau|France]], [[Stromberg (TV series)|Germany]], [[La Job|Quebec]], [[Os Aspones|Brazil]] and the [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lsplitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|work=Sidespliter|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Gervais and Merchant are producers of the American version, and they also co-wrote the episode "[[The Convict]]" for the show's third season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4687784.stm|title=Gervais writing US Office episode|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Gervais has said that the episode "[[Episode Four (The Office, Series One)|Training]]" is his favourite, where Brent plays his guitar and sings.

===''Extras''===
{{Main|Extras (TV series)}}
[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]] had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the sitcom ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a [[Extra (actor)|background artist]]. Millman is more self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais's ''The Office'' character David Brent. Guest stars on the first series of ''Extras'' include [[Ross Kemp]], [[Les Dennis]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Francesca Martinez]]. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and featured appearances by [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Diana Rigg|Dame Diana Rigg]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Patricia Potter]], [[Sophia Myles]], [[Moira Stuart]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/dec/28/lastnightstvextras |title=Extras attacked celebrity - with a little help from George Michael, David Tennant et al|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

A Christmas special of ''Extras'' aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by [[George Michael]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], Jonathan Ross and [[David Tennant]].

Gervais is influenced by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', in making ''Extras'', particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-curb-effect-how-larry-david-changed-comedy-forever-20110720/ricky-gervais-0166936|title=Tricky Gervais The Curb Effect How Larry David Changed Comedy Forever |work=Rollingstone|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

Gervais said there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend around recording many hours of film which Gervais edits down to about an hour each episode.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11326209|title=Ricky Gervais says show with Karl Pilkington is real|work=BBC|accessdate =6 March 2015}}</ref>

Gervais said that the series is about "kindness [being] more important than anything else". He added "It’s about the forgotten – everyone’s forgotten. It’s all these arbitrary people who didn’t know each other, and they’re in there now because they’re in the last years of their life. And it’s about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It’s about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they’re together." He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched ''[[Secret Millionaire]]'' – "It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country... I think it's perfect for now."<ref name=independentderek>{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|title='Mock the disabled?

===Stand-up comedy===
Gervais made some unsuccessful attempts at stand-up in the late 1990s, but his first successful show took place at the [[Cafe Royal]], as part of the [[2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Titled ''Rubbernecker'', the show also featured [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Robin Ince]] and [[Stephen Merchant]].

Gervais later toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show ''[[Animals (comedy)|Animals]]''. The ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]'' tour followed a year later. Both of these shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of the themed live trilogy, ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'', took place in 2007. It started in [[Glasgow]] in January and ended in [[Sheffield]] in April. [[Blackpool]] reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/13/4816/what_a_sell-out|title=What a sell-out, Huge demand for Gervais tour}}</ref> More dates were added.
[[File:RickyGervais.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gervais performing in 2007]]
''[[Newsnight Review]]'''s panel saw ''Animals'' during its [[UCL Bloomsbury|Bloomsbury]] run and covered it in January 2003. They were not favourable, with ''[[Private Eye]]'' editor [[Ian Hislop]] say it was "cobbled together...banal...a bit flat".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=BBC News, 13&nbsp;January 2003 | date=13 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an "ugly little pug-faced cunt".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a179513/ten-things-you-never-knew-about-ricky-gervais.html|title=Ten Things You Never Knew About Ricky Gervais|work=Digitalspy.co.uk|first=Alex |last=Fletcher|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=Newsnight Review discussed Ricky Gervais one man show Animals at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.|work=BBC|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>

''Fame'' was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais told a story, ostensibly about how people will do anything to become famous, to a Scottish audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/26941/Ricky-Gervais-Centre-Of-Controversy-Over-Ipswich-Joke|title=Ricky Gervais Center of Controversy Over Ipswich Joke|work=Enterntmanetwise|accessdate=25 January 2015 }}</ref> The story referred to a question asked of Gervais five years earlier by a reporter: what could someone do to become famous like you? To which he replied, "Go out and kill a prostitute". He followed up with the [[punch line]], "I won't do that bit in Ipswich", referring to the [[Ipswich 2006 serial murders|December 2006 murders of five prostitutes in Ipswich]]. The joke drew criticism from the father of victim Tania Nicol: "These days, they want to make a joke out of anything. I feel he's just being uncaring, quite honestly". Gervais defended himself: "I do want people to know that that happened five years ago and is not related to anything now. That is the problem with comedy, a joke that is funny today can be a terrible ''faux pas'' tomorrow".

Gervais's fourth show was entitled ''[[Science (comedy)|Science]]'', and commenced with an eleven date tour in August 2009 at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]] in Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web |date=August 2004 |url=http://www.rickygervais.com/sciencelive.php |title=Ricky Gervais...

===Other television appearances===

===Animation===
One of the first animations Gervais voiced was the character of Penguin in [[Robbie the Reindeer]]'s ''Legend of the Lost Tribe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/n2kph/robbie-the-reindeer-in-legend-of-the-lost-tribe|title=Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe|work=Radiotimes|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>

Gervais guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife]]". He is the only British comic to write and star in a ''Simpsons'' episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed and Confused]]'' magazine (January 2006): "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a ''Simpsons'' script. I'm going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort". Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied:
<blockquote>I've always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend's idea. We watch ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' at the moment, we watch ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...]]'' we watch all those reality TV shows&nbsp;— ''The Office'' came out of those docu-soaps".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=3&ObjectID=1665&CityID=3|title= Interview at UKULA}}</ref></blockquote>

===Entertainment===
Gervais made a cameo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in a ''Digital Short'' during which he joked that ''The Office'' was adapted from a Japanese programme of the same name (with [[Steve Carell]] reprising his role as Michael Scott). The sketch re-creates scenes from the American and British pilot episode with Japanese elements (although in an exaggerated way). "It's funny", Gervais laughs at the end, "because it's racist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a437948/ricky-gervais-to-host-saturday-night-live.html|title=Ricky Gervais to host 'Saturday Night Live'?|date=13 November 2012|work=Digitalspy|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

===Boxing===
In 2002, Gervais took part in a [[Charitable cause|charity]] [[boxing]] match, for [[Comic Relief]], against Grant Bovey, who is known to the public only due to his relationship with TV personality [[Anthea Turner]]. On his Saturday afternoon radio show on [[Xfm London]] Gervais and partners Merchant and Pilkington had discussions on both Gervais's attitude towards boxing and training in general, as well as his likelihood of victory against Bovey. Initially, Merchant had questions as to why Gervais was participating in the event, due to his dislike of slight pain and his inexperience with fitness in general. He was trained for the three-round contest by famous boxing trainer brothers [[Frank Maloney|Frank]] and Eugene Maloney, at their Fight Factory gymnasium. It was the second televised charity boxing match, the first being [[Bob Mortimer]] against [[Les Dennis]].
