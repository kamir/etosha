'''''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''''' is a 2000 [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] written, produced, edited, and directed by [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]], and starring [[George Clooney]], [[John Turturro]], and [[Tim Blake Nelson]], with [[John Goodman]], [[Holly Hunter]], and [[Charles Durning]] in supporting roles.

==Plot summary==
In 1937, Ulysses Everett McGill ([[George Clooney]]), Pete Hogwallop ([[John Turturro]]), and Delmar O'Donnell ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]) escape from a [[chain gang]] at [[Mississippi State Penitentiary|Parchman Farm]] and set out to retrieve the $1,200,000 in treasure that Everett claims to have stolen from an armored car and buried before his incarceration.  They have four days to find it before the valley in which it is hidden will be flooded to create [[Arkabutla Lake]] as part of a new [[hydroelectric]] project.  Early in their escape, while still chained together, they try to jump onto a moving train, but are dragged off when Pete trips.  They then encounter a blind man<!--the problem is NOT that we don't understand who Tiresias is. The problem is that we don't KNOW from a citation that this particular blind man is SUPPOSED to represent Tiresias. Need neutral, reliable reference---> ([[Lee Weaver]]) traveling on a [[handcar]].  They hitch a ride, and he tells their futures.  They "seek a great fortune" and they will "find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek".  They will also see many wonders on their journey, including a "cow on the roof of a cotton house".

The trio comes to the house of Pete's cousin, Washington B. "Wash" Hogwallop ([[Frank Collison]]), who removes their chains, but because he needs the money from the bounty, turns them in to the police later that night, led by Sheriff Cooley ([[Daniel von Bargen]]).  The authorities set the barn where they are sleeping ablaze, but the trio quickly escapes with the help of Wash's son.  When they pass a congregation on the banks of a river the next morning, Pete and Delmar are enticed by the idea of [[baptism]], to the immense derision of the skeptical Everett.  As the journey continues, they travel briefly with a young guitarist named [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]] ([[Chris Thomas King]]).  When asked why he was at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere, he reveals that he [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the devil]] in exchange for the ability to play the guitar.  Tommy describes the devil as being "White, as white as you folks...with empty eyes and a big hollow voice.  He love to travel around with a mean old hound," a description which matches Sheriff Cooley and his dog.

They come across a radio station run by a blind man ([[Stephen Root]]) and record the song "[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]", calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys.  Unknown to them, the song becomes famous "as far away as [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]".  The trio parts ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by police that night, and they continue on their own.  Among their many encounters, the most notable are a famous bank robber [[Baby Face Nelson|George "Baby Face" Nelson]] ([[Michael Badalucco]]), and a run-in with three [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s who seduce and knock them unconscious with corn liquor. When Everett and Delmar awake, they find that Pete has vanished and only his clothes remain with a leopard frog inside.  Delmar believes the sirens turned Pete into a toad and carries the toad in a box.  A little later, one-eyed Bible salesman Daniel "Big Dan" Teague ([[John Goodman]]) invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the frog.

The next day, Everett and Delmar arrive in Everett's home town only to find that Everett's wife, Penny ([[Holly Hunter]]), is engaged to Vernon T. Waldrip ([[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]]), campaign manager for [[Governor|gubernatorial]] candidate Homer Stokes ([[Wayne Duvall]]).  She refuses to take Everett back and is so ashamed of him that she has been telling their daughters he was killed by a train.

While watching a film in a cinema, Everett and Delmar discover that Pete is still alive.  The sirens had turned him in to collect the bounty on his head.  After Everett and Delmar rescue him from jail that night, Pete tells them that he revealed the location of the treasure.  Everett admits that he only was in prison for [[Unauthorized practice of law|practicing law without a license]] and that there was never any armored car robbery, nor treasure.  He only mentioned it to persuade the other men (who were chained to him) to escape so he could reconcile with his wife, who wrote to him, telling him she would be getting remarried.  Pete is outraged at this news, primarily because he only had two weeks left on his original sentence and must now serve an additional 50 years for his escape.

The trio stumbles upon a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally, in which the [[Grand Wizard|Imperial Wizard]] sings "[[O Death]]", and discovers that Tommy has been captured and is about to be lynched.  The three disguise themselves as the [[color guard]] and attempt a rescue, but Big Dan, a Grand Cyclops in the Klan, reveals their identities and chaos ensues, in which the Imperial Wizard is revealed to be Stokes.  The trio flees the scene, with Everett cutting the wires supporting a large [[Cross burning|burning cross]], which falls on and incinerates some of the Klansmen (including Big Dan).

Everett convinces Pete, Delmar, and Tommy to help him win his wife back.  Disguised as musicians, they sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner she is attending.  Everett tries to convince his wife he is "[[Good faith|bona fide]]", but she brushes him off.  The group begins an impromptu musical performance beginning with "[[In the Jailhouse Now]]" followed by "Man of Constant Sorrow", during which the crowd recognizes them as the Soggy Bottom Boys and goes wild.  Stokes, on the other hand, recognizes them as the group who disgraced his lynch mob and shouts for the music to stop, angering the crowd.  He denounces the Soggy Bottom Boys as hostile to the social order, but the crowd is unimpressed and [[Riding the rail|runs him out of town on a rail]].  Pappy O'Daniel ([[Charles Durning]]), the sitting governor, seizes the opportunity. He gets on stage, dances, and endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys, granting them a full pardon; he then has them join in singing "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" while the event is played on the radio.  Penny accepts Everett back, but demands that he find her original ring if they are to be married.  As they leave the dinner, they run into a mob taking to jail a jubilant George, who happily claims he will be electrocuted.  Delmar comments, "Looks like George is right back on top again."

The next morning, the four men set out to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley where Everett originally claimed to have hidden the treasure.  When they arrive, Cooley and his men arrest them and prepare to hang them.  Everett protests, stating they had been pardoned on the radio, but Sheriff Cooley ignores their pleas, responding that where he comes from, "they don't have a radio".  The three start to despair while Everett improvises a prayer to be saved.  Suddenly, the valley is flooded and they are saved from hanging while Sheriff Cooley, his dogs, and his men drown during the flood.  Using one of their coffins as a raft, Pete and Delmar jubilantly praise God, while Everett dismisses the incident as luck.  He pipes down though, as a cow floats by on top of a submerged cotton house. Tommy finds the ring in a desk on which he is floating, and they return to town.

Everett and Penny walk through town with their daughters in tow, singing.  Everett presents the ring to Penny, who promptly states that it is the wrong one and demands her ring back.  As Everett protests the futility of trying to find it at the bottom of the lake, the blind man rolls by on his railway handcar, his voice joining those of the girls in song.

==Cast==
* [[George Clooney]] as Ulysses Everett McGill, a man who is imprisoned for [[Unauthorized practice of law|practicing law without a license]].

He corresponds to [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses) in the ''Odyssey''.<ref name="classica">{{citation|title=Something old, something new, something borrowed: the Odyssey and O Brother, Where Art Thou|first=Pernille|last=Flensted-Jensen|journal=[[Classica et Mediaevalia|Classica Et Mediaevalia: Revue Danoise De Philologie]]|volume=53|year=2002|pages=13–30|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_otjS0BC2dMC&pg=PA13}}</ref>
* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Delmar O'Donnell, a small-time crook imprisoned for robbing a [[Piggly Wiggly]] in [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]]; he at first claims innocence, but later admits he is guilty. Delmar says he will spend his share of Everett's nonexistent money buying back his family farm, believing, "you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land."
* [[John Turturro]], as Pete Hogwallop, a fellow criminal who reveals little about his past. He believes in being true to one's kin, even when his cousin Washington B. Hogwallop betrays him.

* [[Frank Collison]] as Washington B. "Wash" Hogwallop, Pete's paternal cousin.  He removes the chains off Pete and the others, but later attempts to turn them into the police.
* [[John Goodman]] as Daniel "Big Dan" Teague, a one-eyed man who masquerades as a [[Bible]] salesman and mugs Everett. Later, he reveals the identity of the trio when they are disguised at a Ku Klux Klan rally, but they kill him by cutting loose a burning cross that falls onto him and the Klansmen. He corresponds to the cyclops [[Polyphemus]] in the ''Odyssey''.<ref name="classica"/>
* [[Holly Hunter]] as Penny Wharvey-McGill, Everett's ex-wife; a demanding woman, she is fed up with Everett's wheeling and dealing, and divorces him while he is in prison, telling their children that he was hit by a [[Louisville & Nashville]] train. She is engaged to Vernon T. Waldrip until Everett wins her back. She corresponds to [[Penelope]] in the ''Odyssey''.<ref name="classica"/>
* [[Charles Durning]] as Menelaus "Pappy" O'Daniel, the incumbent [[Governor of Mississippi]]. He is frequently seen berating his son and his campaign managers, who are depicted as simpletons. His character is based on [[Texas]] governor [[W. Lee O'Daniel|W. Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2010/08/today-in-texas-history-gov-pappy-odaniel-resigns/ |title=Today in Texas History: Gov.

* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Sheriff Cooley, a ruthless rural sheriff who pursues the trio for the duration of the film. He eventually ambushes them after they have been pardoned by the governor; he intends to hang them regardless, but when the valley is flooded, he drowns with his men and dog. He fits Tommy Johnson's description of the devil in that his sunglasses look like "big empty eyes" and he travels with a [[bloodhound]]. He corresponds to [[Poseidon]] in the ''Odyssey''<ref name="classica"/> and has been compared to Boss Godfrey in ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]''.<ref>Conard, Mark T. ''The Philosophy of the Coen Brothers'' (2009)</ref>
* [[Wayne Duvall]] as Homer Stokes, the reform candidate in the upcoming election for Governor. He travels the countryside with a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], who depicts the "little man", and a [[broom]], with which he promises to "sweep this state clean". He is secretly an [[Imperial Wizard]] in the Ku Klux Klan. He falsely identifies Everett, Pete, and Delmar as colored people because they were dirty.
* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Vernon T. Waldrip, Penny's "bona fide" suitor. He is the manager of the Homer Stokes campaign. The character's name has been suggested to be a nod to novelist [[Howard Waldrop]], whose novella ''[[A Dozen Tough Jobs]]'' is one of the inspirations behind the film.<ref>{{cite web | last=Datlow | first=Ellen |author2=Howard Waldrop  | title=Howard Waldrop Interviewed | work=Readercon 15 | year=2003 | url=http://fanac.org/Other_Cons/ReaderCon/r15-rpt.html | accessdate=November 9, 2007}}</ref> He corresponds to the [[Suitors of Penelope]] in the ''Odyssey''. <ref name="classica"/>
* [[Michael Badalucco]] as [[Baby Face Nelson|George Nelson]], is portrayed as a [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] bank robber who dislikes being called "Baby Face". In reality, George Nelson died three years earlier in 1934. Given the story takes place in 1937 (and as the real George Nelson died in a shootout known as the [[Battle of Barrington]] rather than by [[electric chair]] as suggested in the film), his appearance in the film is historically inaccurate. 
* [[Stephen Root]] as Mr. Lund, the blind radio station manager who records Everett's story in the song "Man of Constant Sorrow", and makes him known throughout the state. He corresponds to [[Homer]].<ref name="classica"/>
* [[Lee Weaver]] as the Blind Seer, a mysterious railroad man who accurately predicts the outcome of the trio's adventure, as well as several other incidents. He corresponds to [[Tiresias]] in the ''Odyssey''.<ref name="classica"/>

==Production==
The idea of ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' arose spontaneously. Work on the script began long before the start of production in December 1997, and was at least half-written by May 1998. Despite the fact that Ethan described the ''Odyssey'' as "one of my favorite storyline schemes" neither of the brothers had read the epic and were only familiar with its content through adaptations and numerous references to the ''Odyssey'' in popular culture.<ref name = "Logic Soft Drugs">{{cite book | title=The Logic of Soft Drugs | publisher=Positive | author=[[Michel Ciment]], Hubert Niogret. | year=1998}}</ref> According to the brothers, Nelson (who has a degree in classics from [[Brown University]]<ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800302265/bio Tim Blake Nelson Biography]</ref><ref>Kari Molvar, {{Wayback |date=20011226063441 |url=http://brownalumnimagazine.com/storydetail.cfm?ID=61 |title="Q&A: Tim Blake Nelson" }}, ''Brown Alumni Magazine'' (March/April 2001).</ref>) was the only person on the set who had read the ''Odyssey''.<ref name = "guardin">{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/may/19/culture.features| title=Double Vision | publisher=The Guardin | date=May 18, 2000 | accessdate=February 14, 2012 | author=Romney, Jonathan}}</ref>

The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 [[Preston Sturges]] film ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'', in which the protagonist (a director) wants to direct a film about the [[Great Depression]] called ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''<ref name="FAQ" /> that will be a "commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, the problems that confront the average man". Lacking any experience in this area, the director sets out on a journey to experience the human suffering of the average man, but is sabotaged by his anxious studio. The film has some similarity in tone to Sturges' film, including scenes with prison gangs and a [[black church]] choir. The prisoners at the picture show scene is also a direct homage to a nearly identical scene in Sturges' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sull.html|title=Sullivan's Travels (1941)| accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref>

Joel Coen revealed in a 2000 interview that he came to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Arizona, to offer the lead role to Clooney. Clooney agreed to do the role immediately, without reading the script. He stated that he liked even the Coens' least successful films.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/22/entertainment/ca-3289 | title=George Clooney: O Brother, Where Art Thou? | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=October 8, 2013 | author=Hochman, Steve}}</ref>

[[John Turturro]], who plays Pete, had been a constant actor for the Coens. ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' was the fourth film of the brothers in which he has starred. Other actors in ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' who had worked previously with the Coens include [[John Goodman]] (three films), [[Holly Hunter]] (two), Michael Badalucco, and [[Charles Durning]] (in one film each).

One of the notable features of the film is its use of digital [[color correction]] to give the film a [[Sepia (color)|sepia]]-tinted look.<ref name="CGS">{{cite web|last=Robertson|first=Barbara|title=CGSociety — The Colorists|work=The Colorists|publisher=The CGSociety| date=May 1, 2006|url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=3549|accessdate=October 24, 2007| pages=3}}Filmed near locations in Canton, MS; Florence, SC; and Wardville, LA.

''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film which otherwise had very few visual effects. The work was done in Los Angeles by [[Cinesite]] using a [[Spirit DataCine]] for scanning at 2K resolution, a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color, and a [[Kodak]] Lightning II recorder to put out to film.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bob Fisher|title=Escaping from chains|journal=American Cinematographer|date=October 2000|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct00/brother/ }}</ref>

A major theme of the film is the connection between [[old-time music]] and political campaigning in the [[U.S. southern states|Southern U.S.]] It makes reference to the traditions, institutions, and campaign practices of [[bossism]] and [[Reform movement|political reform]] that defined Southern politics in the first half of the 20th century.

The [[Ku Klux Klan]], at the time a political force of white [[populism]], is depicted burning crosses and engaging in ceremonial dance.

While the film borrows from real-life politics, differences are obvious between the characters in the film and historical political figures. The O'Daniel of the movie used "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" as his theme song (which was originally recorded by real-life [[Governor]] of [[Louisiana]] [[Jimmie Davis|James Houston "Jimmie" Davis]]<ref name=ROS>{{cite web|title=River of Song: The Artists |work=Louisiana: Where Music is King|publisher=[[The Filmmakers Collaborative]] & [[The Smithsonian Institution]]|year=1998| url=http://www.pbs.org/riverofsong/artists/e4-jimmie.html|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref>) and Homer Stokes, as the challenger to the incumbent O'Daniel, portrays himself as the "reform candidate", using a broom as a prop.

==Music==

Music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support.

Tommy, the lead guitarist of the Soggy Bottom Boys, is an intentional reference to the legend of [[Delta blues]] artist <!-- Do not change to Robert -->[[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]], who claimed to have sold his soul to the devil in return for blues fame.<ref name="tommy"/> The same connection can be made to Robert Johnson, who was also reputed to have sold his soul to the Devil at a crossroads in return for musical skills. This attribution is supported when the boys drop off Tommy at a crossroads, "Cross Road Blues" being a signature song of Robert Johnson.
