'''''Evan Almighty''''' is a 2007 American comedy film and the [[sequel|stand-alone sequel]]/[[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] to ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' (2003). The film was directed by [[Tom Shadyac]], based on the characters created by [[Steve Koren]] and [[Mark O'Keefe]] from the original film, and starring [[Steve Carell]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Lauren Graham]], [[John Goodman]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Jimmy Bennett]], and [[Wanda Sykes]]. Production of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern day retelling of [[Noah's Ark]].

By the time the film premiered on June 10, 2007, it had become the second [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film comedy]] ever at the time, behind ''[[Men in Black 3]]''. The film grossed less than its budget of $174 million worldwide, and it received generally negative reviews.<ref name="RTintro">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evan_almighty/|title=Evan Almighty|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref><ref name="MetaCritic">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/evanalmighty?q=Evan%20Almighty|title=Evan Almighty|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.

''Evan Almighty'' was also notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but [[Universal Pictures]] stressed the animals' conditions were acceptable. This was despite objections, from animal rights group [[PETA]]. 

==Plot==
Newly elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], former local television news reporter Evan Baxter ([[Steve Carell]]) leaves his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]] and moves to suburban [[northern Virginia]], where his congressional campaign declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to [[God in Christianity|God]] ([[Morgan Freeman]]) to give him this opportunity. On the other hand, his wife, Joan ([[Lauren Graham]]), expresses her concern about the new location and prays that she, Evan, and their three sons ([[Jimmy Bennett]], [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]], and [[Johnny Simmons]]) will be closer together as a family. On the first day of his job, Evan is given a prime office space, where he is accompanied by his three congressional staffers, Rita, Marty, and Eugene ([[Wanda Sykes]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[John Michael Higgins]]), and invited to co-sponsor the Public Land Act bill with his boss, Chuck Long ([[John Goodman]]). Soon after Evan's arrival to Congress, six strange things start to happen around him:

#His alarm clock repeatedly goes off at 6:14&nbsp;a.m.
#Ancient tools and [[gopher wood]] are delivered to his house.
#Pairs of animals simply follow Evan without any apparent reason (with birds even flying into his office through the window).
#Evan grows a beard that immediately reappears no matter how many times he shaves.
#Eight vacant lots in Evan's neighborhood are purchased in his name.
#The number "614" increasingly appears everywhere he goes.

Evan soon learns that the number refers to the verse in the [[Book of Genesis]], where God instructs [[Noah]] to build [[Noah's Ark|an Ark]] in preparation for a [[Flood myth|flood]]. God repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, cordially insisting that Evan should build an Ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Evan's family initially believes that he is having a [[mid-life crisis]]. Later, his three sons suspect something greater is occurring and assist him, along with various animals, in the construction of the Ark, although Joan does not.

In the foreground of the image is a paved street.|The Ark used for filming was located in [[Crozet, Virginia]].]]
Animals eventually follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, he allows Evan latitude at first, but warns him that he will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change in appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the Ark, God presents him with a robe, and later tells him that the flood will likely come at midday on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new looks and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but soon realizes that God will not allow him to take it off and wear anything else after two failed tries to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress, animals follow him once again. Once Evan finally explains his reason for this, his facial hair, and his robe, he is temporarily suspended from Congress after humiliating himself in front of many witnesses. Long later removes Evan from the Public Land Act bill that he is co-sponsoring with him. Joan watches the news on television and initially believes that Evan is going insane, and decides to return to her mother's home. Joan packs up her van and takes her sons to come with her, much to their reluctance. Evan deduces that God purposely had him suspended from Congress so that he would have more time to build the Ark, although Joan remains skeptical and departs. Evan decides to build the Ark alone, gaining media attention and public ridicule, as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, wearing a name tag displaying "Al Mighty". In this guise, God listens to Joan as she picks up the newspaper she was reading and shows it to him, which mocks Evan and features him building the Ark. Joan explains that Evan claims that God asked him to do it, but she is concerned that Evan is only losing his sanity and allowing himself to become the laughingstock of the neighborhood. Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is an opportunity for him, and explains that he himself does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan returns to Evan with new-found faith and helps him and the animals finish the Ark together in order to prepare for the flood. Meanwhile, word reaches Evan that Long has commissioned a dam and has cut corners in doing so.

On September 22, Evan loads hundreds of animals onto the newly finished Ark in front of spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew and try to destroy the Ark, since it violates numerous building codes. Minutes pass with no sign of rain, provoking spectator scorn. A large rainstorm does come, but it is brief. Joan asks Evan to leave the Ark and believes that maybe God did not mean a literal flood, but a metaphorical one. However, Evan witness Long's dam burst from the distance, causing all of the spectators, reporters, and policemen to immediately seek refuge in the Ark, which rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of [[Washington, D.C.]]. The Ark reaches its final destination in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Evan tells Long that the flood was caused by his poor design of the dam, which incites other Congressmen also present to turn against Long. 

After Congress puts the Public Land Act bill on hold to investigate Long's defective dam and the animals returning to their natural habitat, Evan is given his job back with a promotion, and celebrates these events by finally shaving his beard, changing back into his regular clothes, and going on a long-promised hiking trip with his family. When God reappears once again during the hike, Evan is initially disappointed when he realizes that he never needed to build the Ark again in the first place, since the flood only happened because of Long's defective dam. However, God reassures Evan that he now has a perfect life as well as everything that he had originally prayed for, and that this would not have happened otherwise. Evan is happy to realize this, as God informs him that the right way to change the world is by doing one [[random act of kindness|Act of Random Kindness]] (ARK) at a time. During the film's closing credits, God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience: "Thou shalt do the dance", and later follow by the footage where the film's cast and crew dance to "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]" by [[C+C Music Factory]].

==Production==
===Screenplay===
The film's screenplay was originally titled ''The Passion of the Ark'' and was written by [[Bobby Florsheim]] and [[Josh Stolberg]].<ref name="KillerMoviess">{{cite news|url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html|publisher=Killer Movies|title=Columbia Get "The Passion Of The Ark"|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp1AMoVu|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004. The script was sold to [[Sony Pictures]] in a deal worth $2,500,000 plus a percentage of the profits, a record for a [[spec script]] from previously unproduced writers.<ref name="DavePhil">{{cite news |url=http://www.cornerofthesky.com/dsp.htm|title=About Us - Dave Phillips|publisher=Corner of the Sky|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp1LWdp1|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> [[Universal Studios]] immediately made a deal to co-produce the script with [[Sony]] and have [[Steve Oedekerk]] rewrite it into the sequel to ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''. Steve Oedekerk had been involved with ''Bruce Almighty'' as an executive producer and co-writer of the screenplay (with [[Steve Koren]] and [[Mark O'Keefe]], who wrote the story).  The studio later discarded the original ''The Passion of the Ark'' script completely, and Oedekerk fashioned a new script from scratch (only he received final credit on the finished film as screenwriter). Jim Carrey was asked to reprise his role as Bruce in the sequel and, when he declined, director Tom Shadyac convinced Steve Carell to accept the leading role.<ref name="JoBlo3333">{{cite news|last=Sampson|first=Mike|url=http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=8433|title=Carell back to Almighty|publisher=JoBlo|date=August 26, 2005|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp1l7nNe|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> Shadyac, reflecting on the first film, stated "[Carell] delivered some of the funniest stuff in the movie.

===Casting===
[[Jim Carrey]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] both declined to reprise their roles from the original ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''. Although Carrey did act in a sequel to ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', he has said that he is "not a big fan of doing the same character twice."<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-06-22-carell-side_x.htm|title=Carell, Freeman are cut-ups on the 'Evan Almighty' set|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp1yxQLA|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> This marked the third time a sequel has been made to a film for which Carrey declined to reprise his role; the first were ''[[Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd|Dumb and Dumberer]]'' and ''[[Son of the Mask]]''. However, Carrey did reprise his role as Lloyd Christmas in ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]''.

===Budget===
The initial budget, at approximately $140 million, led ''Evan Almighty'' to become the most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million.<ref name="LorMun">{{cite news|first=Lorenza|last=Muñoz|title=Budget Overruns of Biblical Proportions|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061019065820/www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-fi-evan9oct09,0,2164715.story?coll=cl-movies|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 9, 2006|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp2AKizF|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million.<ref name="NYTimesBO" /> The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to [[Universal Studios]].<ref name="LorMun" /> Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role.<ref name="usatoday" /> The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] area.<ref name="StarEx">{{cite news|last=Kitchin|first=Jessica|title="Evan Almighty" helping area businesses boom|url=http://www.starexponent.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=CSE/MGArticle/CSE_MGArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1137836450841|publisher=Star Exponent.com|date=May 31, 2006|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp2I2Ea2|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref>

===Ark design and construction===
[[File:EvanAlmightyarkconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ark being prepared for filming a scene]]
Construction of the ark began in January 2006 and the scenes involving the ark were shot in a [[Crozet, Virginia]] subdivision called Old Trail.<ref name="UPEA" /> The ark was designed to meet the actual measurements of the [[Noah's Ark|biblical ark]], measuring {{convert|450|ft|m}} long, {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|51|ft|m}} high.<ref name="usatoday" /> The ark's layout was also based on pictures in several children's books that crew members had read in their childhoods.<ref name="UPEA" /> When the characters were filmed during the day building the ark or were on location elsewhere, crew members would further construct the ark at night.<ref name="UPEA" /> A concrete base was built to support the weight of the large ark; after filming was completed, the ark was taken down in a week, and the base in another week.<ref name="UPEA" />

In disassembling the set, everything that was salvageable from the ark was donated to [[Habitat for Humanity]]. "Leave no trace" was the slogan used by the director as part of the DVD's bonus features, "The Almighty Green Set".

===Costumes and filming locations===
[[File:Evanark.jpg|left|thumb|Evan and God sitting in the half-built Ark. Research was done to give Evan's costume an authentic, ancient look.<ref name="UPEA" /> Some controversy focused on God being portrayed in human form.<ref name="Malaysia" />]]
To create Evan's beard and long hair, three designers would take three hours each day adding individual hairs using prosthetic [[adhesive]] and making Carell wear custom wigs. The wigs consisted of both human and [[yak]] hair.<ref name="USATodaybeard" /> With his new look, Carell was sometimes nicknamed "Mountain Man", "[[Retrosexual]]", or "[[Theodore Kaczynski|Unabomber]]."<ref name="USATodaybeard">{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-05-04-evan-almighty_x.htm|title=First look: Steve Carell lets his hair down for "Almighty"|date=May 4, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref> For his costumes, designers spoke with [[textile]] experts, researched historical information on the clothing that was likely worn at the time of Noah, and used aged fibers for the clothing.<ref name="UPEA" />

Scenes for the film were filmed in various locations in [[Virginia]], including areas in and around [[Crozet, Virginia|Crozet]], [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], and [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], though some filming did take place at Universal Studios in [[Hollywood, California]].<ref name="Welcome to Huntsville">{{cite news|first=Michael L.|last=Owens|url=http://www.newsvirginian.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WNV/MGArticle/WNV_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1137835569845 |title=Welcome to Huntsville|work=The News Virginian|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080210015540/http://www.newsvirginian.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WNV/MGArticle/WNV_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1137835569845 |archivedate = February 10, 2008}}</ref>

===Effects===
For the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] used throughout the film, companies [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm & Hues]] (R&H) and [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) developed different parts of the film. R&H focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C.<ref name="VFXWorld1">{{cite news|last=McLean|first=Thomas J.|title=Evan Almighty: Choreographing CG Water of Biblical Proportions|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/ievan-almightyi-choreographing-cg-water-biblical-proportions|publisher=Animation World Network|date=July 6, 2007|accessdate=August 7, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp2VBm3X|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where you were going to get a really long look at the water and what it was doing."<ref name="VFXWorld1" /> The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]''.<ref name="VFXWorld1" /> [[Lighting]] was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] stage, and the [[visual effects]] company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.<ref name="VFXWorld1" />

[[File:Huntsville Festival of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Signage on a lamppost in downtown Waynesboro, Virginia for ''Evan Almighty'' filming.]]
Rhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots.<ref name="UPEA" /> R&H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements.<ref name="UPEA" /> In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months. Andy Arnett, the animation supervisor, declared that "The research was extensive. It took six or seven months to perfect the look and feel of the animals before we had the first shot out the door."<ref name="UPEA" />

For the scene in Congressman Long's office, CGI was used the entire time for the fish that follow Evan around from the [[Aquarium|fish tank]]. [[Cafe FX]], the visual effects company hired for the scene, ordered ten different kinds of [[tropical fish]] from a local store and studied their movements to imitate them on screen using computer animation. Jeff Goldman, the visual effects supervisor, stated "Early in the sequence, we mimicked the actual behavior of the fish in our animation, but as the scene plays out, the fish are a counterpoint to Steve Carell's comedic timing."<ref name="VFXW">{{cite news|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|title=CafeFX Swims with the Fish for Evan Almighty|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=3631a5a1&atype=news&id=20334|publisher=Animation World Network|date=July 10, 2007|accessdate=August 7, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp2i8wZ9|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref>

==Marketing==
In late May during production, the media learned that director Tom Shadyac angrily complained to producers, saying "I'm not seeing any ads, and I don't know why. I'm not getting answers. People are giving me information that isn't true...I'm only hearing about all the other summer movies, and nothing about mine."<ref name="Cinem">{{cite news|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title="Evan Almighty" Director Clashes With Studio Over Advertising, Source Says|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/06/03/evan-almighty-director-clashes-with-studio-over-advertising-s/|publisher=Cinematical|date=June 3, 2007|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp2mbomM|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> Shadyac also fired his marketing consultants that he had used for prior films due to his thoughts over the mishandling of the marketing.

==Environmental impact==
Director [[Tom Shadyac]] felt the film reflected environmental themes of how humans are stewards of God's creation. In keeping with the themes, ''Evan Almighty'' became NBC Universal's first film to offset the production's carbon emissions.<ref name="ChristianPost">{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Jennifer|title="Evan Almighty" Makes Environmental Push through Biblical Story|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28059_'Evan_Almighty'_Makes_Environmental_Push_through_Biblical_Story.htm|work=The Christian Post|date=June 19, 2007|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rp31rAhB|archivedate=August 8, 2010}}</ref> Producer Michael Bostick revealed how the emissions were offset: <blockquote>"We worked closely with The Conservation Fund to calculate our carbon emissions from what we used on the movie—whether from vehicles used or any of the construction equipment.

===Bans===
[[Malaysia]]'s Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) called for a ban on the film, claiming it is offensive to [[Islam]]. Secretary-General Maamor Osman claimed that the film was depicting the great flood as comedy and characterized God with the portrayal of a human, both of which are considered blasphemous in Islam. Similarly there was some public protest against ''Bruce Almighty'' being shown in theaters, but that movie was released on DVD and is now shown on television broadcasts.
