He is primarily known for his [[Emmy Award]]-winning role as [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]] during the 1970s and early 1980s, on both ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', making him one of the few television actors to portray the same leading character in both a comedy and a drama.

In 2009, he [[Voice acting|starred]] as the voice of Carl Fredricksen in [[Pixar]]'s award-winning animated film ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''. In early 2011, Asner returned to television as [[butcher]] Hank Greziak in ''[[Working Class (TV series)|Working Class]]'', the first original [[sitcom]] on cable channel [[Country Music Television|CMT]]. He  starred in the Canadian television series ''[[Michael, Tuesdays and Thursdays]]'', on [[CBC Television]] and has appeared in the 2013 television series ''[[The Glades (TV series)|The Glades]]'', in the episode "Killer Barbecue".

==Career==
{{main|Ed Asner filmography}}
Following his military service, Asner joined the Playwrights Theatre Company in Chicago, but left for [[New York City]] before members of that company regrouped as the [[Compass Players]] in the mid-1950s.  He later made guest appearances with the successor to ''Compass'', ''[[The Second City]]'', and is considered part of ''[[The Second City]]'' extended family. In New York City, Asner played Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Threepenny Opera]]'', and began to make inroads as a television actor.  There were two standout performances on television.  The first was as Detective Sgt. Thomas Siroleo in the 1963 episode [[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]] titled "[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]" and as the reprehensible Ex-Premiere Brynov in the 1965 ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' episode "The Exile".

Before he landed his role with [[Mary Tyler Moore]], Asner guest-starred in such [[television series]] as the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[crime drama]] ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'', starring [[Beverly Garland]], and the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Outlaws (1960 TV series)|The Outlaws]]''. He was also cast on [[Jack Lord]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series ''[[Stoney Burke (TV series)|Stoney Burke]]'' and in the series finale of [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]'', starring [[Harry Guardino]]. He also appeared on ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'',''[[The Invaders]]''. Asner also played a minor character in children's television show ''W.I.T.C.H.'' (Napoleon- Cornelia's younger sister's cat).

Asner is best known for his character [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]], who was first introduced on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' in 1970. In 1977, after the series, Asner's character was given his own show, ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' (1977–82). In contrast to the ''Mary Tyler Moore'' show, a thirty-minute [[comedy]], the ''Lou Grant'' show was an hour-long award-winning [[drama]] about journalism.  (For his role as Grant, Asner is the only actor to win an Emmy Award for a sitcom and a drama for the same role.)  Other television series starring Asner in regular roles include ''[[Thunder Alley]]'', ''[[The Bronx Zoo (TV series)|The Bronx Zoo]]'', and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. He also portrayed art smuggler August March in an episode of the original ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'' (1975) and reprised the role in the ''[[Hawaii Five-0]]'' (2012) remake.

Asner was acclaimed for his role in the ABC miniseries ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]'', as Captain Davies, the morally conflicted captain of the ''Lord Ligonier'', the slave ship that brought [[Kunta Kinte]] to America. That role earned Asner an [[Emmy Award]], as did the similarly dark role of Axel Jordache in the mini-series ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (TV miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'' (1976). In contrast, he played [[Pope John XXIII|a former Pontiff]] in the lead role of ''Papa Giovanni: Ioannes XXIII'' (''Pope John XXIII'' 2002), an Italian miniseries for [[RAI]].

Asner has also had an extensive [[voice acting]] career.  He provided the voices for Joshua on ''Joshua and the Battle of Jericho'' (1986) for [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[J. Jonah Jameson]] on the 1990s animated television series ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' (1994–98); Hoggish Greedly on ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]'' (1990–95); [[Manhattan Clan#Hudson|Hudson]] on ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (1994–96); [[Jabba the Hutt]] on the [[Star Wars (radio)|radio version of ''Star Wars'']]; Master Vrook from ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and its [[star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords|sequel]]; [[Roland Daggett]] on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (1992–94); Cosgrove on ''[[Freakazoid!]]''; Ed Wuncler on ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' (2005–14); and [[Granny Goodness]] in various [[DC Comics]] animated series.  Asner also provided the voice of famed American orator Edward Everett in the 2015 documentary film ''The Gettysburg Address''.

Asner provided the voice of Carl Fredricksen in the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Pixar]] film ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009). He received great critical praise for the role, with one critic going so far as to suggest "They should create a new category for this year's Academy Award for Best Vocal Acting in an Animated Film and name Asner as the first recipient."<ref>{{cite web | title = Keith Cohen review of "Up" | publisher = Entertainment Spectrum | url = http://entertainmentspectrum.com/index/movies/926/up. | accessdate = May 31, 2009}}</ref>

He has appeared in a recurring segment, on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', entitled "Does This Impress Ed Asner?"

He was cast in a [[Country Music Television]] comedy pilot, ''Regular Joe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Ed-Asner-Comedy-1019547.aspx|title=Ed Asner Signs On to CMT Comedy Pilot|publisher=TVGuide.com}}</ref>

In 2001, Asner was the recipient of the [[Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award]].<ref>{{Wayback |date=20120301170816 |url=http://www.sagawards.org/previous-life-achievement-recipients/2001 |title=Edward Asner - 2001 Life Achievement Recipient - Screen Actors Guild Awards}}</ref>

Asner has won more [[Emmy Awards]] for performing than any other male actor (seven, including five for the role of Lou Grant). In 1996, he was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame|Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Wayback |date=20140111113337 |url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/hall-fame/hall-fame-archives-honorees |title=Hall of Fame Archives: Inductees - Academy of Television Arts & Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/hall-of-fame-honorees|title=Television Hall of Fame Honorees: Complete List}}</ref>

In July 2010, Asner completed recording sessions for ''Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders''; a documentary on the 1974 DeFeo murders in Amityville, New York. Asner served as the narrator for the film, which covers a forensic analysis of the murders, the trial in which 23-year-old DeFeo son Ronald DeFeo Jr., was convicted of the killings, and the subsequent "haunting" story which is revealed to be a hoax.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1786665/ | title=IMDB » Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders (2011) | accessdate= February 11, 2011}}</ref> Also in 2010, Asner played the title role in "FDR", a stage production about the life of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]<ref>[http://www.windwoodtheatricals.com/html/fdr.html].</ref> he has subsequently continued to tour the play throughout the country. In January 2011, Asner took a supporting role on CMT's first original sitcom ''[[Working Class (TV series)|Working Class]]''.  He made an appearance in the independent comedy feature ''[[Not Another B Movie]]'', and had a small but pivotal role as billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] in HBO's 2011 economy drama ''[[Too Big to Fail (film)|Too Big to Fail]]''.

Asner has also provided voice-over narration for many documentaries and films of social activism, including ''Tiger by the Tail'', a documentary film detailing the efforts of the Campaign to Keep GM Van Nuys Open and the chair of the organization, [[Eric Mann (civil rights organizer)|Eric Mann]], to keep [[General Motors]]' [[Van Nuys Assembly]] plant running.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Goldman, Michael (Director) | date=1986 | title=Tiger by the Tail| trans-title = | medium=Motion picture | location=Los Angeles | publisher=}}</ref>

==Activism==

===Political views===

Asner served two terms as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], in which capacity during the 1980s he opposed US policy in Central America, working closely with the Alliance for Survival.  He played a prominent role in the [[Strike and Emmy Awards boycott of 1980|1980 SAG strike]].<ref name=museo>{{cite web | author= Kassel, Michael B. | title=Asner, Ed | url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=asnered | publisher= [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] | date= November 29, 2007 | accessdate= April 6, 2008}}</ref> He has also been active in a variety of other causes, such as the movement to free [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] and the movement to establish [[single-payer health care]] in California, California One Care, for which he created a television advertisement. He endorsed [[Barack Obama]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2008]].

The sudden cancellation of ''Lou Grant'' in 1982 was the subject of much controversy.  The show had high ratings—the level of which should have justified its ongoing presence in primetime (it was in the [[ACNielsen]] top ten throughout its final month on the air). However, the CBS television network declined to renew it. It has been Asner's consistent position that his political views, as well as the publicity surrounding, were the actual root causes for the show's cancellation.<ref name=museo/>

Ed Asner endorsed Democratic Candidate [[California's 36th congressional district special election, 2011|Marcy Winograd]] in the 2011 [[California's 36th congressional district special election, 2011|California 36th Congressional district special election]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://winogradforcongress.com/2011/ed-asner-urges-voters-to-protect-social-security-medicare-from-robber-barons-who-looted-america-to-pay-for-the-wars/| title = Ed Asner Urges Voters to 'Protect Social Security & Medicare from Robber Barons Who Looted America to Pay for the Wars' | accessdate = April 28, 2011| author=Staff | date=April 28, 2011 | publisher=Winograd For Congress}}</ref>

In 2012, Asner came under fire from conservatives for narrating an animation promotional video for the [[California Federation of Teachers]], ''Tax the Rich: An Animated Fairy Tale''.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sean-hannity-slams-ed-asner-398102].  ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.</ref>

===Opposition to SAG/AFTRA merger===
[[File:Ed Asner by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Asner at the 2012 [[Phoenix Comicon]]]]
On March 30, 2012 the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA) completed a merger of equals, forming a new union SAG-AFTRA. Asner is adamantly opposed to such a merger, citing that the planned merger would destroy the SAG's health plan and disempower actors.<ref>{{YouTube|pxfUfqXWKuA|Former SAG President Edward Asner speaks out against the SAG-AFTRA merger}}</ref> Asner and a group fellow actors and voice-actors including [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Ed Harris]], filed a lawsuit against SAG President [[Ken Howard]] and several SAG Vice Presidents, seeking to have the merger overturned, and the two unions separated to their pre-merger organizations.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/sag-aftra-anti-merger-lawsuit-drops-demand-295573 Hollywood Reporter - SAG/AFTRA Anti Merger Lawsuit Drops Demands.]</ref> The lawsuit is currently working its way through the court system.
