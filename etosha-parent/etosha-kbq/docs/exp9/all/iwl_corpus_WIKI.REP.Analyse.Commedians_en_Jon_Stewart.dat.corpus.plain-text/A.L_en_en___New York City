==History==
{{Main|History of New York City}}
{{see also|Timeline of New York City history}}

===Etymology and early history===
During the [[Wisconsinan glaciation]], the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large [[ice sheet]] over 1000 feet in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil, leaving the [[bedrock]] that serves as the geologic [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] for much of New York City today. Later on, the ice sheet would help split apart what are now [[Long Island]] and [[Staten Island]].

In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present day New York City was inhabited by various bands of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], including the [[Lenape]], whose homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island; the western portion of Long Island, including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens; Manhattan; and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]], including the Bronx.<ref>Evan T. Pritchard: Native New Yorkers: the legacy of the Algonquin people of New York, p.27 (2002); ISBN 1-57178-107-2</ref>

The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer in the service of the [[Kingdom of France|French crown]], who sailed his ship ''[[La Dauphine]]'' into [[New York Harbor]]. He claimed the area for France and named it "Nouvelle Angoulême" ([[New Angoulême]]).<ref name="rodgers">{{cite book|title=New York: The World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}</ref>
[[File:The Purchase of Manhattan Island.png|thumb|[[Peter Minuit]] is credited with the purchase of the island of Manhattan in 1626.|alt=A pen drawing of two men in 16th-century Dutch clothing presenting an open box of items to a group of Native Americans in feather headdresses stereotypical of plains tribes.]]

A [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] expedition led by captain [[Estêvão Gomes]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailing for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], arrived in [[New York Harbor]] in January 1525 aboard the purpose-built caravel "La Anunciada" and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named ''Rio de San Antonio''. Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to [[Spain]] in August. The first scientific map to show the North American East coast continuously, the 1527 world map known as the [[Padrón Real]], was informed by Gomes' expedition, and labeled the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] as ''Tierra de Esteban Gómez'' in his honor.<ref>Wpa Writer's Project:A Maritime History of New York, p.246;Going Coastal Productions (2004) ISBN 0-9729803-1-8</ref>

In 1609, [[English people|English]] explorer [[Henry Hudson]] re-discovered the region when he sailed his ship the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' ("Half Moon" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) into New York Harbor while searching for the [[Northwest Passage]] to the [[Orient]] for his employer the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He proceeded to sail up what he named the ''[[Hudson River|North River]]'', also called the ''Mauritis River'', and now known as the [[Hudson River]], to the site of the present-day New York State capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in the belief that it might represent an oceanic [[tributary]]. When the river narrowed and was no longer [[saline water|saline]], he realized it wasn't a sea passage and sailed back downriver. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for his employer. In 1614 the area between [[Cape Cod]] and [[Delaware Bay]] would be claimed by the [[Netherlands]] and called ''Nieuw-Nederland'' ([[New Netherland]]).

The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was [[Dominican people (Dominican Republic)|Dominican]] trader [[Juan (Jan) Rodriguez|Juan Rodriguez]] (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues). Born in [[Santo Domingo]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[African people|African]] descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–1614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], from 159th Street to 218th Street, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Sam|title=Honoring a Very Early New Yorker|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/honoring-a-very-early-new-yorker/?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/juan-rodriguez-monograph.cfm Juan Rodriguez monograph].

At the end of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the English gained New Amsterdam (New York) in North America in exchange for Dutch control of [[Run (island)|Run]], an [[Indonesia]]n island. Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some [[epidemic]]s brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.<ref>"[http://www.penntreatymuseum.org/americans.php Native Americans]". Penn Treaty Museum.</ref> By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.<ref>[http://www.gothamcenter.org/ "Gotham Center for New York City History"] Timeline 1700–1800</ref>

New York grew in importance as a [[port|trading port]] while under [[British Empire|British rule]] in the early 1700s. It also became a center of [[slavery]], with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/hidden-history-slavery-new-york#|title=The Hidden History of Slavery in New York|author=Adele Oltman|publisher=The Nation|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor.  Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the [[African Burying Ground]] in the 1990s during construction of a new federal courthouse near [[Foley Square]] revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.

The trial in Manhattan of [[John Peter Zenger]] in 1735 helped to establish the [[freedom of the press]] in North America. In 1754, [[Columbia University]] was founded under charter by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] as King's College in Lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Historical Sketch of Columbia College, in the City of New York, 1754–1876 |author=Moore, Nathaniel Fish |year=1876 |page=8 |publisher=Columbia College}}</ref> The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in New York in October 1765 as the [[Sons of Liberty]] organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.

The [[Battle of Long Island]], the largest battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]], was fought in August 1776 entirely within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, leaving subsequent smaller [[Engagement (military)|armed engagements]] following in its wake, the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees, as well as escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuated]] at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 [[freedmen]] for resettlement in [[Nova Scotia]]. They resettled other [[freedman|freedmen]] in England and the [[Caribbean]].

The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the [[Conference House]] on Staten Island between American [[delegate]]s, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], and British general [[Lord Howe]] on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|Great Fire of New York]] occurred, a large conflagration on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]].<ref>Trinity Church bicentennial celebration, May 5, 1897 By Trinity Church (New York, N.Y.) p. 37</ref>

In 1785, the assembly of the [[Congress of the Confederation]] made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the first capital under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]]. In 1789, the first President of the United States, [[George Washington]], was inaugurated; the first [[United States Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] each assembled for the first time, and the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was drafted, all at [[Federal Hall]] on Wall Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=The People's Vote: President George Washington's First Inaugural Speech (1789) |publisher=U.S. News and World Report |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page11.htm |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> By 1790, New York had surpassed [[Philadelphia]] as the largest city in the United States.

Public-minded members of the old merchant elite lobbied for the establishment of [[Central Park]], which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.

The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between immigrants and blacks for work.

New York's non-white population was 36,620 in 1890.<ref>Ira Rosenwaike (1972).''[http://books.google.com/books?id=2OR2yeASrfIC&pg=PA78&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Population History of New York City]'', p.78.</ref> New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the American South, and by 1916, New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].  The larger economic boom generated construction of [[skyscraper]]s competing in height and creating an identifiable [[skyline]].

New York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in early 1920s, overtaking [[London]].  The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in early 1930s, becoming the first [[megacity]] in human history.<ref>

Returning [[World War II]] veterans created a postwar economic boom and the development of large [[housing tract]]s in eastern Queens. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The [[United Nations Headquarters]] was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global [[geopolitical]] influence, and the rise of [[abstract expressionism]] in the city precipitated New York's displacement of [[Paris]] as the center of the art world.<ref>

New York's population reached all-time highs in the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]] and then again in the 2010 Census.

New York City is in the [[Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)|Northeastern United States]], in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Boston]].<ref>Washington, D.C. is {{convert|228|mi|km}} driving distance from New York, and Boston is {{convert|217|mi|km}} driving distance from New York.&nbsp;– [http://maps.google.com/ Google Maps]</ref> The location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]], which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], has helped the city grow in significance as a trading [[port]]. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of [[Long Island]], Manhattan, and Staten Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.

The [[Hudson River]] flows through the [[Hudson Valley]] into [[New York Bay]]. Between New York City and [[Troy, New York]], the river is an [[estuary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/fc.1.estuaries.html |title=Information About the Hudson River Estuary |publisher=Life.bio.sunysb.edu |accessdate=August 20, 2011}}</ref> The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]]. The [[East River]]—a tidal strait—flows from [[Long Island Sound]] and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The [[Harlem River]], another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx.

New York City is composed of five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Regionalism and realism: A Study of Government in the New York Metropolitan Area |author=Benjamin, Gerald, Richard P. Nathan |year=1990 |publisher=[[Brookings Institute]] |page=59}}</ref> Each borough is coextensive with a respective [[county (United States)|county]] of [[New York|New York State]] as shown below.

Throughout the boroughs, there are [[:Category:Neighborhoods in New York City|hundreds of distinct neighborhoods]], many with a definable history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States.

* '''[[Manhattan]]''' (New York County) is the most densely populated borough and is home to [[Central Park]] and most of the city's skyscrapers. Most of the borough is on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]]. Several small islands are also part of the borough of Manhattan, including [[Randall's Island]], [[Wards Island]], and [[Roosevelt Island]] in the [[East River]], and [[Governors Island]] and [[Liberty Island]] to the south in [[New York Harbor]]. There is also a small neighborhood in Manhattan that constitutes a part of the [[mainland United States]], called [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]], which is contiguous with the Bronx.{{paragraph}}Manhattan is the administrative and [[financial center]] of the city and contains the [[headquarters]] of many major corporations, the [[United Nations Headquarters]], a number of important universities, and many cultural attractions. Manhattan Island is loosely divided into [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], and [[Upper Manhattan|Uptown]] regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the [[Upper East Side]] and the [[Upper West Side]], and above the park is [[Harlem]]. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the "outer boroughs".
* '''[[The Bronx]]''' (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough, the location of [[Yankee Stadium]], home of the [[New York Yankees]], and home to the largest [[housing cooperative|cooperatively owned housing]] complex in the United States, [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Frazier, Ian |title=Utopia, the Bronx |work=The New Yorker |date=June 26, 2006 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/26/060626fa_fact_frazier |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> The Bronx is the only New York City borough with a majority of it a part of the mainland United States.

* '''[[Brooklyn]]''' (Kings County), on the western tip of [[Long Island]], is the city's most populous borough and was an independent city until 1898. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, [[List of Brooklyn neighborhoods|distinct neighborhoods]], and a distinctive architectural heritage. [[Downtown Brooklyn]] is the only central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including [[Coney Island]], established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coney Island: The People's Playground |author=Immerso, Michael |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=0-8135-3138-1}}</ref>
* '''[[Queens]]''' (Queens County), on Long Island east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most [[ethnic diversity|ethnically diverse]] county in the United States,<ref name="queensdiverse">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/nyregion/04fourth.html |author=O'Donnell, Michelle |title=In Queens, It's the Glorious 4th, and 6th, and 16th, and 25th&nbsp;... |work=New York Times|date=July 4, 2006 |accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref> as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.<ref name=QueensMostDiverseWorld1/><ref name=QueensMostDiverseWorld2/> Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence.

The New York City Fire Department faces highly multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to [[High-rise|high-rise structures]], there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires. New York is also home to one of the largest [[New York City Subway|subway systems]] in the world, consisting of hundreds of miles of tunnel with electrified track.

New York City's food culture includes a variety of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. [[Central Europe]]an and [[Italian diaspora|Italian]] immigrants originally made the city famous for [[bagel]]s, [[Cheesecake#North America|cheesecake]], and [[New York-style pizza]], while [[Chinese restaurant|Chinese]] and other Asian restaurants, [[sandwich]] joints, [[trattoria]]s, [[diner]]s, and [[coffeehouse]]s have become ubiquitous.

===Accent and dialect===
{{Main|New York City English}}
The New York area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the [[New York City English|New York dialect]], alternatively known as ''Brooklynese'' or ''New Yorkese''. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within [[American English]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Michael |year=2005 |chapter=New York Talk |title=American Voices |editor1-first=Walt |editor1-last=Wolfram |editor2-first=Ben |editor2-last=Ward |pages=82–87 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-2109-2 }}</ref> The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working-class people of [[European American|European]] descent. However, the influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,<ref name=NYT19930214/> and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as in the past.<ref name=NYT19930214>{{cite news |last=Sontag |first=Deborah |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260 |title=Oy Gevalt! New Yawkese An Endangered Dialect? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 14, 1993 |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

The traditional New York area accent is characterized as [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so that the sound {{IPA|[ɹ]}} does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as "New Yawk."<ref name=NYT19930214/> There is no {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in words like ''park'' {{IPA|[pɑək]}} or {{IPA|[pɒək]}} (with vowel backed and [[vowel breaking|diphthongized]] due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' {{IPA|[bʌɾə]}}, or ''here'' {{IPA|[hiə]}}. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[ɔr]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]]. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like "girl" and of words like "oil" became a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced "goil" and ''oil'' is pronounced "erl"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like "Joizey" (Jersey), "Toidy-Toid Street" (33rd St.) and "terlet" (toilet).<ref name=NYT19930214/> The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' (played by [[Carroll O'Connor]]) was a notable example of having used this pattern of speech, which continues to fade in its overall presence.

[[File:New York City Hall.jpg|thumb|[[New York City Hall]] is the oldest City Hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions.|alt=A wide white building in a colonial style with a cupola in the center.]]

Each borough is coextensive with a [[judicial district]] of the [[New York Supreme Court]] and hosts other state and city courts. Manhattan also hosts the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department]], while Brooklyn hosts the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division, Second Department]].

Uniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different [[United States District Court]]s: the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], whose main courthouse is on [[Foley Square]] near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx, and the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]], whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] and [[United States Court of International Trade]] are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan.

Chen|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 5, 2013|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}</ref> elected in [[New York City mayoral election, 2013|2013]] with over 73% of the vote, who assumed office on January 1, 2014.

The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of November 2008, 67% of registered voters in the city are Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_nov08.pdf|title=NYSVoter Enrollment by County, Party Affiliation and Status|date=November 2008|publisher=New York State Board of Elections|accessdate=February 8, 2009}}</ref> New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President [[Calvin Coolidge]] won the five boroughs in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1924|1924]]. In [[United States presidential election in New York, 2012|2012]], Democrat [[Barack Obama]] became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. [[Party platform]]s center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.

Following a financial crisis and state [[bailout]] in 1975, the New York [[Board of Control (municipal government)|Financial Control Board]] was created to oversee municipal spending. The Mayor of New York City and the [[Governor of New York|Governor of New York State]] both serve on the seven-member board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcb.state.ny.us/members.asp|title=Financial Control Board|publisher=State of New York|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> While direct management of the city's budget ended in 1986, the board continues to monitor the city's financial health.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York State Financial Control Board|url=http://www.fcb.state.ny.us/|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref>

New York is the most important source of [[political fundraising]] in the United States, as four of the top five [[ZIP code]]s in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP code, 10021 on the [[Upper East Side]], generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of [[George W. Bush]] and [[John Kerry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 Election Overview: Top Zip Codes |publisher=Opensecrets.org |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topzips.php?cycle=2004 |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]] (or annually sends $11.4&nbsp;billion more than it receives back). The city also sends an additional $11&nbsp;billion more each year to the state of New York than it receives back.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Fair Share of State Budget: Does Albany Play Fair with NYC?|publisher=New York City Finance Division |date=March 11, 2005 |url=http://webdocs.nyccouncil.info/attachments/65379.htm?CFID=232457&CFTOKEN=33008944 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080525082617/http://webdocs.nyccouncil.info/attachments/65379.htm?CFID=232457&CFTOKEN=33008944 |archivedate=May 25, 2008 |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref>
