While working as a [[model (person)|model]], Selleck attended the [[University of Southern California]] on a [[college basketball|basketball scholarship]] where he played for the [[USC Trojans men's basketball]] team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vitale |first=Dick |url=http://assets.espn.go.com/dickvitale/vcolumn010831NewYorkplusJWill.html |title=Jason Williams' injury a big topic at U.S. Open |publisher=ESPN  |date=April 17, 2003 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref> He is a member of [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.nndb.com/people/677/000023608/ Tom Selleck] nndb.com</ref> and a member of the [[Trojan Knights]].

==Career==

===Early work and ''Magnum P.I.''===
[[File:Tom Selleck - publicity - 1980-1.jpg|thumb|upright|''Magnum P.I.'' publicity photo, 1980]]
Selleck's first TV appearance was as a college senior on ''[[The Dating Game]]'' in 1965, and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as [[Pepsi-Cola]].

He began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'', ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', and ''[[The Seven Minutes (film)|The Seven Minutes]]''. He also appeared in number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. Selleck also had a recurring role in the 1970s as "too good to be true" private investigator Lance White in ''[[The Rockford Files]]''. Lance was very trusting and always lucky, much to the annoyance of [[Jim Rockford (television character)|Jim Rockford]], the show's star private eye played by [[James Garner]]. White would frequently say to Rockford, "Don't worry, Jim; clues will turn up," and then a clue would just turn up, much to Rockford's consternation, for whom obtaining clues required hard work and hard knocks. Selleck's character was based on one played in Garner's earlier TV series ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957) by [[Wayde Preston]] in the episode "The Saga of Waco Williams".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Selleck, an accessible but relatively untested actor, spent years receiving little interest from the entertainment industry. His big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in ''Magnum, P.I.''. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the   role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which then went to rising star [[Harrison Ford]].   It turned out shooting of the pilot for ''Magnum'' was delayed for over six months by a [[List of Hollywood strikes|writers' strike]], which would have enabled him to complete ''Raiders''.{{fact|date=March 2015}}

===Film===
[[File:Tom Selleck Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|Selleck at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Selleck starred in the 1979 TV movie ''[[Concrete Cowboys]]'' with [[Jerry Reed]]. He starred in a number of film roles during and after ''Magnum''; among the most notable were as an [[acrophobia|acrophobic]] police detective in ''[[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]]''; as a stand-in father in ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''; and as an American 19th century sharpshooter in the Australian [[western movie|western]] ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' – a role and film that he considers one of his best. His other films include ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]''; ''[[High Road to China]]''; ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]''; ''Coma''; ''[[Her Alibi]]''; ''[[An Innocent Man (film)|An Innocent Man]]''; ''[[Folks! (film)|Folks!]]''; ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]''; ''[[Mr. Baseball]]''; ''[[In & Out]]'' and ''[[The Love Letter (1999 film)|The Love Letter]]''.

Selleck is an avid outdoorsman, and a marksman and  [[firearms]] collector. These interests led him to leading-man [[cowboy]] roles in [[Western films]], starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal [[Sackett|Orrin Sackett]] in the 1979 film ''The Sacketts'', opposite [[Sam Elliott]], [[Jeff Osterhage]], and Western legends [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]. He followed ''The Sacketts'' with ''The Shadow Riders'' in 1982, then portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]'' in 1984.  ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' is probably one of his best known Western films, although he also won a "Western Heritage Award" for his 1997 role in ''[[Last Stand at Saber River]]''. His last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] movie [[Crossfire Trail (film)|''Crossfire Trail'']] (based on a [[Louis L'Amour]] novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture ''Monte Walsh''.

He most recently appeared in the film ''[[Killers (2010 film)|Killers]]'', along with [[Katherine Heigl]] and [[Ashton Kutcher]].

===Television===

====''Magnum P.I.''====
[[File:Selleck1.jpg|thumb|upright|Selleck on the Red Carpet at the [[Academy Awards|61st Annual Academy Awards]] in 1989]]
Selleck played the role of [[Thomas Magnum]] in 1980 after six other previous TV-pilot attempts that were never sold.  Magnum was a former [[U.S. Navy]] Officer, a veteran of a special operations unit in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the "Naval Intelligence Agency" (a fictional version of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii.  The show would go on for eight seasons and 162 episodes until 1988, winning him an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tom-selleck |title=Tom Selleck Emmy Award Winner |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in [[36th Primetime Emmy Awards|1984]]. Selleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style [[aloha shirt]], a [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball cap, and the Colt Model 1911A1 .45 ACP Caliber pistol his character carried. Magnum drove a [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308GTSi]] in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a "Magnum" Ferrari.

Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored ''Magnum P.I.'' movie.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0698726/ Selleck Wants Back in the Magnum Driver's Seat](March 4, 2009)From Reelzchannel.com – IMDb.com</ref>

====''Friends''====
In the mid-nineties, Selleck played the role of [[Richard Burke (Friends)|Richard Burke]], Monica's boyfriend, starting at the end of the second season of the hugely successful TV series ''[[Friends]]''. Richard was a divorced [[ophthalmologist]] who was a friend of Monica's parents, and at first the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard's reluctance to commit to raising a family, though Selleck did make a few extra appearances in later shows.

====''The Closer''====
In February 1998, Selleck accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called ''[[The Closer (1998 TV series)|The Closer]]''. In it he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand new marketing firm. His costars included [[Ed Asner]], [[David Krumholtz]], and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for his first series since ''Magnum, P. I.'', low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.

====Jesse Stone series====
Since 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman [[Jesse Stone novels|Jesse Stone]] in a series of made-for-TV movies based on [[Robert B. Parker]]'s novels. To date, the series comprises eight films, with the most recent released on May 20, 2012.<ref name="eight">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/01/26/emmy-and-golden-globe-award-winner-tom-selleck-stars-in-jesse-stone-benefit-of-the-doubt-a-new-television-movie-to-be-broadcast-sunday-may-20-082404/20120126cbs03/|title=EMMY AND GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD WINNER TOM SELLECK STARS IN "JESSE STONE: BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT," A NEW TELEVISION MOVIE TO BE BROADCAST SUNDAY, MAY 20|work=The Futon Critic.com|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> In addition to his portrayal of the films' protagonist, Selleck now also acts as producer for the series. The fifth film, ''Jesse Stone: Thin Ice'', was not adapted from Parker's novels, but rather an original story by Selleck.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/arts/television/27ston.html | work=The New York Times | title=Sometimes, the Crime Finds the Cop | first=Neil | last=Genzlinger | date=February 27, 2009}}</ref>

====''Las Vegas''====
He joined the cast of the NBC drama ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'' in the season-five premiere on September 28, 2007. He played A.J. Cooper, the new owner of the Montecito Casino. He replaced [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], who left the cast in the same episode. This was Selleck's first regular role on a drama show since he played [[Thomas Magnum]] on ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''.

====''Blue Bloods''====
''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'' is an American police procedural/drama series on [[CBS]], filmed on location in New York City. Frank Reagan (Selleck) is the Police Commissioner; the series follows the Reagan family of police officers with the New York City Police Department. The show premiered on September 24, 2010.

====Other work====
Selleck has also appeared in a number of made-for-TV movies in recent years. In particular, he has sought to help bring back to popularity the [[Western movie|western]], often playing one of that genre's typical characters but thrust into a modern context.

Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in ''[[Baywatch]]'', but turned down the role because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to [[David Hasselhoff]].

Selleck played the role of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s 2004 made-for-TV movie ''[[Ike: Countdown to D-Day]]''. The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy]], and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.

Selleck appeared in a recurring role on the acclaimed [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama ''[[Boston Legal]]'' as Ivan Tiggs—the troubled ex-husband of Shirley Schmidt ([[Candice Bergen]]).

===Broadway===
In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of [[Herb Gardner]]'s comedic play ''A Thousand Clowns''. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of [[Jason Robards|Jason Robards, Jr.]], who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in [[A Thousand Clowns|a movie version]]. (It remains the role with which Robards is most identified.) Playwright Gardner, however, actually preferred Selleck to Robards in the part, and even said that Selleck was the way he had always envisioned Murray.

===Commercials===
Selleck did the voice-over for the 1993 [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] advertising campaigns titled "You Will." These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, "What if you had the technology to ______ ? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&T." As of December 30, 2007, he began doing [[voice acting|commercial voice-overs]] for Florida orange juice.<ref name="ledger">Kevin Bouffard.

===''The Practical Guide to the Universe''===
In the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called ''The Practical Guide to the Universe'', in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, etc.

==Awards and accolades==
On April 28, 2000, he received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Pepperdine University]]. He was chosen because of his outstanding character and ethic. He is a board member of the non-profit Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics and co-founder of the Character Counts Coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://charactercounts.org |title=Character Education Program: CHARACTER COUNTS!&nbsp;– Lesson Plans, Training, Resources |publisher=Character Counts! |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref> Selleck received a Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1986.

In 1993, during the brief run of the late night ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' on Fox, Selleck guest-starred. As a gag, he asked to be presented his 1992 Worst Supporting Actor [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie award]] for his performance as [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]] in ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]''. When the Razzie was presented to him on the air, Selleck took it in stride and asked the entire studio audience to "blow me a raspberry." Thus Selleck became the third person in Razzie history to voluntarily accept one of the Worst Achievements in Film statuettes.

==Personal life==
From 1971 to 1982, Selleck was married to model [[Jacqueline Ray]]. During that time, he adopted her son, Kevin Shepard (born 1966).

On August 7, 1987, Selleck married [[Jillie Mack]].<ref>[http://www.tv.com/jillie-mack/person/36820/summary.html Jillie Mack: Summary] – TV.com</ref> They have one daughter, Hannah Margaret Selleck<ref>[http://tomselleck.tv-website.com/ Biography] Tom Selleck (Thomas Magnum – Magnum P.I.)</ref> (born December 16, 1988).<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8240365.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Selleck wins lame horse dispute | date=September 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>  The family lives in [[Fallbrook, California|Fallbrook]], [[Freedom, California|Freedom]], and [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>[http://www.larkinhorses.com/About/newsstories.html Young Selleck blazes own trail] Calgary Herald, Saturday, June 28, 2003 – Irish Sporthorses in the news</ref> Selleck has a summer residence in [[Jonesboro, Maine]]. In the 1980s—specifically around the time of filming ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''—Selleck also owned a home on upscale Lakeshore Road in [[Burlington, Ontario]], a city southwest of [[Toronto]]. Selleck recently purchased ranch property near the historic town of [[Prescott, Arizona]].{{fact|date=March 2015}}

Selleck lives on an [[avocado]] farm. In an interview with ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', Selleck talked about living and working on his farm, "So I like to get outside and work on the farm, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it."

He was an accomplished indoor and beach volleyball player playing the outside hitter position for the Outrigger Canoe Club, Honolulu. (Son Kevin attended Selleck's alma mater, USC, and became a volleyball team All-American in 1990.) Outrigger Canoe Club team mate Dennis Berg, in the summer 2011 issue of Volleyball USA magazine, said of Selleck, "Tom was a great team mate, appreciative of being included with such a talented and experienced group, practicing and playing hard when his Magnum schedule permitted.... He was very patient with all of us, and we relished the big crowds that replaced the usual sparse number of players' friends and spouses at the national tourney matches."<ref>{{ISSN|1059-6227}}, vol 39, no 2 Volleyball USA magazine (Summer 2011)</ref>

Selleck is an avid [[ice hockey]] fan and has been seen attending [[Los Angeles Kings]] games at the [[Staples Center]]. He lists [[Anze Kopitar]] and [[Alexander Frolov]] as two of his favorite players. He was once a minority owner of his favorite baseball team since childhood, the [[Detroit Tigers]].

One of Selleck's ''Magnum'' co-stars, [[Larry Manetti]], in his 1996 memoir ''Aloha Magnum'', was lavish in his praise of Selleck. Manetti lauded Selleck for his extraordinary work ethic on a gruelling show (shooting for hours in the midday Hawaiian sun), Selleck's work with Hawaiian charities and his willingness to go to bat for the program's cast and crew members.

In February 2009, Selleck joined the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund]] as national spokesman for the new Education Center being built on the [[National Mall]].<ref name="VVMF"/>

===Political views and the NRA===
To promote his film ''[[The Love Letter (1999 film)|The Love Letter]]'', Selleck was invited to be on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' on May 19, 1999. However, he found himself defending an ad in which he appeared supporting the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) and his position on gun ownership. After questions from O'Donnell, Selleck said, "It's your show, and you can talk about it after I leave."

Selleck is a member of the Board of Directors and public spokesman of the NRA.<ref name=TSDSGTNRA>"Tom Selleck Donates Seven Guns To NRA National Firearms Museum". – [[National Rifle Association]].</ref>  After close friend [[Charlton Heston]] stepped down—due to failing health—as the highly visible public spokesman of the NRA in 2003, Selleck has stepped up in comparable manner to succeed him.<ref>Sherrod, Blackie. – "Is it all politics or show biz?" – ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. – October 31, 2002. | – Schodolski, Vincent J. – " Sean Penn is no Jane Fonda – In Iraq, he kept mouth wide shut". – ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. – January 5, 2003.</ref>  In 2002, Selleck donated the rifle he used in ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (a custom 13-pound [6&nbsp;kg], single-shot, 1874 [[Sharps Rifle]], with a 34-inch [86-cm] barrel),<ref>Sharp, Eric. – "Shooting Star – Antique Black-Powder Rifle Still Scene-Stealer". – ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''. – June 18, 2006.</ref> along with six other firearms from his other films, to the [[National Rifle Association]], as part of the NRA's exhibit "Real Guns of Reel Heroes" at the [[National Firearms Museum]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].<ref name=TSDSGTNRA />
