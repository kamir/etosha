'''Robert Montgomery''' (May 21, 1904&nbsp;– September 27, 1981) was an American film and television actor, director and producer.<ref name="WVobit">''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]] obituary'', September 30, 1981.</ref> He was also the father of actress [[Elizabeth Montgomery]].

==Early life==
Montgomery was born '''Henry Montgomery, Jr.''' in [[Beacon, New York|Fishkill Landing, New York]] (now [[Beacon, New York]]), to Henry Montgomery, Sr. and his wife, Mary Weed Montgomery ([[married and maiden names|née]] Barney).<ref name="Earl">{{cite web|title=Robert Montgomery Biography|author=R.E. Lee|publisher=The Earl of Hollywood|url=http://www.earlofhollywood.com/RMbio.html|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bewitched.net/lizgenealogy.htm "Elizabeth Montgomery's Family Tree"], Bewitched.net; retrieved August 4, 2010.</ref> His early childhood was one of privilege as his father was president of the [[New York Rubber Company]]. His father committed suicide in 1922 by jumping off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]],<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07EEDB1039E133A25750C0A9619C946395D6CF "3 Drwn in Hudson ..."] '' The New York Times'', July 3, 1922.</ref> and the family's fortune was gone.

==Career==
Montgomery went to [[New York City]] to try his hand at writing and acting. He established a stage career, and became popular enough to turn down an offer to appear opposite [[Vilma Bánky]] in the film ''This Is Heaven''.<ref name="inspiration">"Garbo's Lover in 'Inspiration' Was Lucky Role for Montgomery". ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]'', March 22, 1945, p. 1.</ref> Sharing a stage with [[George Cukor]] gave him an in to [[Hollywood]], where, in 1929, he debuted in ''So This Is College''. He entered the moving picture industry during the revolution of the [[Sound film|talkies]], which made it more difficult to impress the studio. One writer claimed that Montgomery was able to establish himself because he "proceeded with confidence, agreeable with everyone, eager and willing to take suggestions". During the production of ''So This Is College'', Montgomery learned from and questioned crew members from several departments, including sound crew, electricians, set designers, camera crew and film editors. In a later interview, he confessed "it showed [him] that making a motion picture is a great co-operative project." ''So This Is College'' gained him attention as Hollywood's latest newcomer, and he was put in one production after another, with his popularity growing steadily.<ref name="inspiration"/>

Montgomery initially played exclusively in comedy roles, but portrayed a character in his first drama film in ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]'' (1930). The studio was initially reluctant to assign him in such a role, until "his earnestness, and his convincing arguments, with demonstrations of how he would play the character" won him the assignment. From ''The Big House'' on, he was in constant demand. Appearing as [[Greta Garbo]]'s romantic interest in ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1930) started him toward stardom with a rush. [[Norma Shearer]] chose him to star opposite her in ''[[The Divorcee]]'' (1930), ''Strangers May Kiss'' (1931), and ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1931), which led him to stardom.<ref name="inspiration"/> During this time, Montgomery appeared in the original [[pre-Code]] film version of ''[[When Ladies Meet (1933 film)|When Ladies Meet]]'' (1933), which starred [[Ann Harding]] and [[Myrna Loy]].

In 1935, Montgomery became President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], and was elected again in 1946. In 1937, he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] as a psychopath in the chiller ''[[Night Must Fall (1937 film)|Night Must Fall]]'', then returned to playing light comedy roles, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) with [[Carole Lombard]], but continued his search for dramatic roles.<ref name="inspiration"/> He was again nominated for an Oscar in 1942 for ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]''. During [[World War II]], he joined the United States Navy, rising to the rank of [[lieutenant commander]], and served on the {{USS|Barton|DD-722}} which was part of the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944.

In 1945, Montgomery returned to Hollywood, making his uncredited directing debut with ''[[They Were Expendable]]'', where he directed some of the [[PT Boat]] scenes when director [[John Ford]] was unable to work for health reasons. Montgomery's first credited film as director was the [[film noir]] ''[[Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947), in which he also starred, which received mixed reviews. Adapted from [[Raymond Chandler]]'s detective novel and sanitized for the censorship of the day, the film was nonetheless noteworthy for the revolutionary way it is filmed entirely from Marlowe's vantage point. Montgomery only appeared on camera a few times, three times in a mirror reflection. He also directed and starred in ''[[Ride the Pink Horse]]'' (1947), also a [[film noir]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Active in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics and concerned about [[communist]] influence in the entertainment industry, Montgomery was a friendly witness before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] in 1947. The next year, 1948, Montgomery hosted the [[Academy Awards]]. He hosted an [[Emmy Award]]-winning television series, ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents]]'', in the 1950s. ''[[The Gallant Hours]]'', a 1960 film Montgomery directed and co-produced with its star, his friend [[James Cagney]], was the last film or television production he was connected with in any capacity, as actor, director or producer. In 1954, Montgomery took an unpaid position as consultant and coach to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], advising him on how to look his best in his television appearances before the nation.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1091EFA3E58157B93C3A91788D85F428585F9 "Behind the Scenes: Robert Montgomery."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 1956.</ref> A pioneering [[media consultant]], Montgomery reportedly had an office in the White House during this time. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Montgomery has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], one for movies at 6440 Hollywood Boulevard, and another for television at 1631 Vine Street.

==Marriages==
His first marriage, in April 1928, was to actress Elizabeth Daniel Allen (December 26, 1904 – June 28, 1992), sister of [[Martha-Bryan Allen]].<ref name="Earl"/><ref>"Elizabeth Allen a Bride". ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 15, 1928, p. 27.</ref> The couple had three children: Martha Bryan, who died at 14 months of age in 1931; [[Elizabeth Montgomery|Elizabeth]] (April 15, 1933 - May 18, 1995); and Robert, Jr. (January 6, 1936 - February 7, 2000). They divorced on December 5, 1950. His second marriage was to Elizabeth "Buffy" Grant Harkness, whom he wed on December 9, 1950, four days after his divorce from his first wife was finalized.<ref>"R. Montgomery Marries". ''The New York Times'', December 12, 1950, p. 47.</ref>

==Death==
Montgomery died of cancer on September 27, 1981, at
[[Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]]. His body was
cremated and the ashes were given to the family.<ref name="Earl"/> His two surviving children, [[Elizabeth Montgomery|Elizabeth]] and Robert Montgomery, Jr., both died of cancer as well.<ref>Pilato 2012, p. XV.</ref>
