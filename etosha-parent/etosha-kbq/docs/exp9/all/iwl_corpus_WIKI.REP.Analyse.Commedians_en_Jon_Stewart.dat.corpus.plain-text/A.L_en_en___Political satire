'''Political satire''' is a significant part of [[satire]] that specializes in gaining entertainment from [[politics]]; it has also been used with subversive intent where [[Political discourse analysis|political speech]] and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of
Political satire is usually distinguished from political [[protest]] or [[political dissent]], as it does not necessarily carry an agenda nor seek to influence the political process. While occasionally it may, it more commonly aims simply to provide entertainment. By its very nature, it rarely offers a constructive view in itself; when it is used as part of protest or dissent, it tends to simply establish the error of matters rather than provide solutions.

Satire can be traced back throughout history; wherever organized [[government]], or social categories, has existed, so has satire.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The oldest example that has survived till today is [[Aristophanes]]. In his time satire targeted top politicians, like Cleon,<ref>Stephanos Matthaios, Franco Montanari, Antonios Rengakos [http://books.google.com/books?id=EZuetiBvK-wC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207 ''Ancient Scholarship and Grammar: Archetypes, Concepts and Contexts''] pp.207-8</ref> and religion, at the time headed by Zeus. "Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith," leading to an increased doubt towards religion by the general population.<ref>[[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Ehrenberg, Victor]] (1962) [http://books.google.com/books?id=oikOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA263 ''The people of Aristophanes: a sociology of old Attic comedy''] p.263 quotation: {{quotation|The fact that the gods could be brought down to a human or 'far too human' level is certainly rooted in the very nature of Greek religion, and there is no doubt that this attitude contributed to the gradual undermining of the old belief in the gods. [...] To tell immoral and scandalous stories about the gods did not offend average religious feeling; it troubled only advanced spirits like Xenophanes and Pintar [...] and it is clear that people no longer believed either in the story or in Zeus. Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith, above all faith in the gods' power, and it was from this that doubt began to grow.<br> The power of the gods, whose dignity and stringth were impressively reflected in most of the tragedies, however different the religious attitudes of the tragic poets were, this same power was on the same festival days belittled and questioned by the comic poets who made fun of the gods and represented traditional and sacred forms in a starling manner.}}</ref> The Roman period, for example, gives us the satirical poems and epigrams of [[Martial]] while some social satire exists in the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus]] in the [[New Testament]] of [[the Bible]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers often engaged in political satire.

Due to lack of political freedom of speech in many ancient civilizations, [[covert satire]] is more usual than overt satire in ancient literatures of [[political liberalism]]. Historically, the [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]] was remarkably influenced by the political [[satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].<ref>Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H.; S. Halliwell, J. Henderson, B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}</ref> Watching or reading satire has since ancient time been considered one of the best ways to understand a culture and a society.<ref>''Aristophanes I: Clouds, Wasps, Birds'', Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X</ref><ref>Emil J. Piscitelli (1993) [http://mysite.verizon.net/thelogos/lect-2.htm ''Before Socrates-Diotima''] ''The Special Case of Aristophanes: Tribal and Civil Justice''</ref><ref>''Life of Aristophanes'', pp.42-seq</ref>

During the 20th and 21st Centuries satire is found in an increasing number of media (in [[cartoon]]s as [[political cartoon]]s with heavy [[caricature]] and exaggeration, and in [[List of political magazines|political magazine]]s) and the parallel exposure of [[political scandal]]s to performances (including [[television]] shows). Examples include musicians such as [[Tom Lehrer]], live performance groups like the [[Capitol Steps]] and the [[Montana Logging and Ballet Co.]], and public television and live performer [[Mark Russell]]. Additional subgenres include such literary classics as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and more recently, internet ''[[Ezine]]'' and website sources such as ''[[The Onion]]''.

==19th century==
===France===
One example is [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu''), which attacks the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]]. It was first published in [[Brussels]] in 1864. The piece used the literary device of a [[dialogue]] between two diabolical plotters in [[Hell]], the historical characters of [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], to cover up a direct, and illegal, attack on Napoleon's rule.  The noble baron Montesquieu made the case for [[liberalism]]; the [[Florence|Florentine]] political writer Machiavelli presented the case for cynical [[despotism]]. In this manner, Joly communicated the secret ways in which liberalism might spawn a despot like Napoleon III. However, [[The Prince#Interpretation_of_The_Prince_as_political_satire|''The Prince'']] itself has also been sometimes understood as political satire.

===Germany===
According to [[George Santayana|Santayana]], Nietzsche was actually "a keen satirist".<ref>[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Santayana%27s%20Criticism%20of%20Nietzsche.htm#The%20Superman George Santayana : ''Egotism in German Philosophy''. 1915. chapter 13.]</ref>
"Nietzsche's satire" was aimed at Lutheranism.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1kRbO4M5CB0C&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=Nietzsche+%22Lutheran+revivalist%22&source=bl&ots=gniaAiHyMW&sig=bx8O9CCvIvECzRJ3MPV81Nr-I2o&hl=en&ei=bFrSSYrzKorItgfV14zxBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Christa Davis Acampora & Ralph R.

==Political Satire in UK media==
The UK has a long tradition of political satire, dating from the early years of English literature. In some readings, a number of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays can be seen - or at least performed - as satire, including ''[[Richard III]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Later examples such as [[Jonathon Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' are more outright in their satirical nature.

In modern era, political satire in the [[United Kingdom]] includes pamphlets and newspaper articles, such as ''[[Private Eye]]'', topical television panel shows such as ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', and television series such as ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[The Thick of It]]''.

==Political Satire on American Television==
Satire became more visible on American television during the 1960s. Some of the early shows that used political satire include the British and American versions of the program ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' (airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company]], or ABC, in the U.S.), [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. During the months leading up to the 1968 presidential election, [[Richard Nixon]] appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and repeated the program's catch-phrase "Sock it to me."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=satire+tv&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones & Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 22]</ref> Other forms of satire of the 1960s and early 1970s typically used the sitcom format, such as the show ''[[All in the Family]]''.

When ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' debuted in 1975, the show began to change the way that comedians would depict the president on television. [[Chevy Chase]] opened the fourth episode of the show with his impersonation of a bumbling [[Gerald Ford]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=satire+tv&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, "With All Due Respect: Satirizing Presidents from ''Saturday Night Live'' to ''Lil' Bush''", in Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones & Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 39-41]</ref> Chase did not change his appearance to look like President Ford, and he portrayed the president by repeatedly falling down on the stage. Some of the other famous presidential impersonations on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' include [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] caricatures, [[Dana Carvey]] as [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Darrell Hammond]] as [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Will Ferrell]] as [[George W. Bush]]. [[Fred Armisen]] was the first cast member to impersonate [[Barack Obama]], and the show's [[Barack Obama]] impersonation is currently performed by [[Jay Pharoah]].

During the 2008 presidential campaign, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' gained wide attention because former cast member [[Tina Fey]] returned to the show to satirize Republican Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. In addition to Fey's striking physical resemblance to Palin, the impersonation of the vice presidential candidate was also noteworthy because of Fey's humorous use of some of exactly the same words Palin used in media interviews and campaign speeches as a way to perform political satire.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=b_Kaca5Fp-wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=entertaining+politics&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BryaUZqoKYb_4AOXtoDQBw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, ''Entertaining Politics: Satiric Television and Political Engagement''. 2nd edition. Rowman & Littlefield, 2010. p.4]</ref>

''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' also uses political satire throughout its ''[[Weekend Update]]'' sketch. ''Weekend Update'' is a fake news segment on the show that satirizes politics and current events. It has been a part of ''SNL'' since the first episode of the show on October 11, 1975.

''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' use stylistic formats that are similar to ''Weekend Update''. On ''The Daily Show'', host [[Jon Stewart]] uses footage from news programs to satirize politics and the news media. [[Stephen Colbert]] performs in character on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' as a right-wing news pundit. Both television programs are broadcast on [[Comedy Central]]. With their shows, Stewart and Colbert have helped increase public and academic discussion of the significance of political satire.
