[[File:Simpsons-Guy.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Peter Griffin]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'' (left) meets [[Homer Simpson]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", a highly publicized crossover between two popular long-running television shows.]]
A '''fictional crossover''' (or simply '''crossover''') is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete [[fiction]]al [[fictional character|characters]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s, or [[fictional universe|universes]] into the context of a single [[Narrative|story]]. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant [[copyright]] holders, unauthorized efforts by [[fandom|fan]]s or common corporate ownership.

==Official crossovers==
Crossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the [[intellectual property]] rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.

Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the [[public domain]] with those concurrently under [[copyright|copyright protection]].

A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from ''[[Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'') or meeting via [[dimensional rift]] or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for [[science fiction]] properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]]. Still others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', where each show is fiction in the other.

===Comics===<!-- This section is linked from [[X-Men (TV series)]] -->
[[File:ArchiePunisher.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[Archie Meets the Punisher]]'' (August 1994). The Marvel version, with identical content but a different cover, was titled ''The Punisher Meets Archie''. Cover art by Goldberg & [[Henry Scarpelli]].]]
Crossovers of multiple characters owned by one company or [[publishing|published]] by one [[publisher]], have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of [[List of comic book publishing companies|comic book publishers]], as different characters in various [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics|DC]] or [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] [[comic book]]s frequently interact with one another since they live in a "[[shared universe]]". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, [[Spider-Man]] has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], just as in the DC Comics Universe, [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these "guest star" roles are common enough that they are not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a [[team-up]]. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This has led to "crossover events", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.

The earliest such crossover event was [[Gardner Fox]]'s ''Zatanna's Search'', which took place in ''[[Hawkman]]'' #4 (October/November 1964), ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #336 (February 1965), ''[[The Atom]]'' #19 (June/July 1965), ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #42 (January 1966), ''Detective Comics'' #355 (September 1966), and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with [[Zatanna]] attempting to reconnect with her father, [[Zatara]], and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], The Atom, Green Lantern, and [[Elongated Man]] along the way.

The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]]. As a way to further toy sales he devised the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' crossover which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a twelve issue mini-series to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with they all returned to their regular titles. This ''Secret Wars'' was hailed as both a critical and commercial success largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of [[Spider-Man]]'s black suit which would later become the villain [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]). [[Jim Shooter]] later perfected his crossover at [[Valiant Comics]] with the [[Unity (comics)|Unity]] event. Unity brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat [[Mothergod]] but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like ''Secret Wars'', the Unity crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe most notably the introduction of [[Turok]], the birth of [[Magnus Robot Fighter]] and the death of a major Valiant hero.

[[Dark Horse Comics]]'s ''Aliens Versus Predator'' franchise was a success that continued into many games and two movies and even an ''Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator'' comic.

The comic crossovers from [[Raj Comics]] are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between [[Nagraj]] and [[Super Commando Dhruva]]. In ''Kohram'', all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish ''Haru'', an extremely powerful enemy.

[[Webcomics]] creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between [[Christopher Baldwin]]'s [[Bruno (webcomic)|Bruno]] and Peter Zale's [[Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comic Strips Crossover On The Net|last=Menefee|first=Craig|date=March 19, 1998|work=[[New Straits Times]]|quote=lasted two weeks|page=38|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

In 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of [[Capcom]]'s character [[Mega Man]], and [[Sega]]'s character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] called "[[Worlds Collide (Archie Comics)|Worlds Collide]]".

There are also [[intercompany crossover]]s these are where characters owned by 2 different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel such as the [[Amalgam comics]]

===Animation===
Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them - like comics or live-action TV shows - will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door''. It features five crossovers - ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', a reference to ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and a quote from ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]'' and ''[[Generator Rex]]'' team up in ''[[Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United]]''. Most of the last episodes of the ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' (a spinoff of the film ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'') had crossovers with various other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons, including ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', and ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]''. The ''[[Jimmy Timmy Power Hour]]'' trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules]]'', based on the [[Hercules (1997 film)|1997 film of the same name]] had an episode titled "[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' in which the [[Rugrats]] are stranded on an island where [[The Wild Thornberrys]] were at the time.

During the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the [[Hanna-Barbera]] properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', which featured appearances by characters from ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'', ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Batman|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|The Addams Family]]''. Later, the ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'' set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]''. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977-79 series ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]],'' which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.

Crossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and [[Warner Bros.]] [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Donald Duck]] made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie).{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The film also includes cameos of characters from [[Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]].The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by [[Porky Pig]] stuttering his famous "That's All, Folks!" line as [[Tinker Bell#Disney|Tinker Bell]] ends the scene with a magical fade-out.

On February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, ''Power Rangers in Space'' and ''Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation'', had their crossover with the episode, "''Shell Shocked'".

On October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, ''Superman: The Animated Series'' and ''The New Batman Adventures'', had their first crossover with the TV movie, "''World's Finest''", in addition to having it released on DVD.

Another cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''. This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]] aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] (from Disney's ''[[DuckTales]]''), [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tigger]], Slimer (from ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''Extreme Ghostbusters''), Michelangelo (from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], [[The Smurfs]], ALF (from [[ALF: The Animated Series|his short-lived cartoon spinoff]]), [[Garfield]], and the trio of [[Kermit the Frog|Baby Kermit]], [[Miss Piggy|Baby Piggy]], and [[Gonzo the Great|Baby Gonzo]] (from Jim Henson's ''[[Muppet Babies]]''). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]], and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.

[[Manga]] artist [[Leiji Matsumoto]] has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the ''[[Maetel Legend]]'', Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been the Yukino Yaoi, protagonist from Queen Millennia. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato is actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.

The adult parody-oriented series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]] from ''[[Family Guy]]'', others involve a personality twist, such as the [[murder|homicidal]] version of [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] from [[Bambi|the eponymous film]] or the [[homosexuality|gay]] version of [[Elmer Fudd]] from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' franchise.

The  Disney/Marvel crossover ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'' features the Marvel heroes [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the Marvel villains [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], [[MODOK]], [[Red Skull]], and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], and characters from ''Phineas and Ferb'', where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz.

During its 26th season, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' has crossovers with ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]''. In the hour-long ''[[Family Guy]]'' season 13 premiere "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", the Griffins meet the Simpson family,<ref>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode 'The Simpsons,' 'Family Guy' doing crossover episode]</ref> who meet the Planet Express crew in the ''Simpsons'' episode "[[Simpsorama]]".<ref name=ewcc>{{cite web|title='The Simpsons' to join forces with 'Futurama' for crossover episode|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/20/the-simpsons-futurama-crossover-epsidoe/|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

===Video games===
{{Main|Fictional crossovers in video games}}''[[Konami]]'' made the first crossover video game featuring ''[[Simon Belmont]]'' from ''[[Castlevania]]'' & Mikey from the Warner Bros. Movie ''[[The Goonies]]'' in ''[[Konami Wai Wai World]]'' for the Famicom in 1988. ''[[The King of Fighters]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'', and many other franchises from third-party developers such as [[Capcom]] and [[SNK Playmore|SNK]] bring these licenses together.

The [[2.5D]] fighting game series ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'', brings various [[Nintendo]] characters together for a massive fight. The third game in the series, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' introduces the first non-Nintendo characters with the inclusion of [[Solid Snake]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' series and [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series respectively. The fourth game in the franchise brings even more non-Nintendo characters to the series with the introduction of ''[[Mega Man]]'' and ''[[PAC-MAN|Pac-Man]]'', in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes.

The [[Namco]]-developed [[Soul (series)|Soul series]], features characters from outside of Namco's titles ([[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, [[Necrid]], [[Heihachi Mishima]] from ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]'', [[Todd McFarlane]]'s [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], ''[[Star Wars]]'s'' [[Darth Vader]], [[Yoda]], and [[Starkiller]], [[Lloyd Irving]] (from [[Tales of Symphonia]]), and [[Ubisoft Montreal]]'s Ezio Auditore (from the [[Assassin's Creed]] series).
''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', released in Japan two months before ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', was the first time that [[Mario]] and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.
In the RPG ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', Disney and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' characters join forces.

''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese [[mecha]] series from many generations, such as ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', and ''[[GaoGaiGar]]''.
More recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco, which will result in the upcoming ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'' and ''[[Tekken X Street Fighter]]''.
The Disney film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' features many video game character ''[[cameo appearances]]''.

===Film===
One of the first film crossovers was ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', in 1943. This was also perhaps the beginning of a film legacy of monsters brawling each other, such as ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' and its sequel, ''[[House of Dracula]]''. In 1948, the comedy film ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' was released. This led to ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy]]''. Then, [[Toho Studios|Toho]] released ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' in 1962. Forty-one years later in 2003, ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' was released by [[New Line Cinema]]. In 2004, [[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' along with the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007.

One year later, both [[Dollman vs. Demonic Toys]] and ''[[Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys]]'' were released by [[20th Century Fox]] and Terry Kelley Studios.

In 2015, [[Sony]] released ''[[Lake Placid vs. Anaconda]]''.

===Literature===
In [[literature]], some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one particular volume; [[L. Frank Baum]] did this regularly, and [[Michael Moorcock]] frequently uses this device – particularly in his [[Eternal Champion]] series of novels, which establish a vast '[[The Multiverse|multiverse]]' populated by numerous different characters, many of whom appear in different novels and even different genres. [[Kim Newman]] is another author who frequently uses this device, as does [[Stephen King]]. The works of [[James Branch Cabell]], [[J.D. Salinger]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Margaret Laurence]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and [[Isaac Asimov]] also 'crossover' with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author [[Rick Riordan]] publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series.

Brazilian writer [[Monteiro Lobato]] also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the [[Cuca (folklore)|Cuca]] and [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], from [[Greek mythology]], from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', from fairy tales such as Grimm's "[[Snow White]]", Western literature such as [[Peter Pan]], cartoons such as ''[[Popeye]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'', and Western films.

===Public domain===
It is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works; a prominent example of this occurs in [[Loren D. Estleman]]'s novel ''Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula'', in which [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dracula]] are brought together and pitted against each other. ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family]] sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Tarzan]]). [[Roger Zelazny]]'s novel ''[[A Night in the Lonesome October]]'' combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such ("The Count", "The Good Doctor", "Jack", etc.).

Occasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]'', wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. [[Fu Manchu]] appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator [[Sax Rohmer]], he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', wherein a character named "[[List of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters#Jimmy Bond|Jimmy]]" is clearly intended to be [[Ian Fleming]]'s character [[James Bond]], though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody [[Sean Connery]]'s appearance in the 2003 [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]]. Another example in ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil [[Harry Potter]].

The TV show ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' is set in a world in which all [[fairy tales]] coexist, including [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], and even [[Alice in Wonderland]]. (As a production of [[The Walt Disney Company]], copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in ''Once Upon a Time''.) The [[Shrek (film series)|''Shrek'']] film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like [[Peter Pan]] (often in the form of [[satire]]).

===Television series===

====Crossovers between established shows====
{{example farm|section|date=February 2012}}
Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. For example, the ''Law and Order'' series afford a commonality of setting which lends itself to crossovers, and they are frequent within the [[Law & Order (franchise)|''Law & Order'' franchise]].

Following the cancellation of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', remaining in the same timeline as their former show.

=====Between related shows=====
Though most common on shows of the same [[production company]] (see, for example, “[[Hurricane Saturday]]”), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or [[television network]]. A notable example of this kind of link is that between ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' These shows were made by different companies, but owned by [[Universal Studios]] and broadcast on [[CBS]]. Another case is that of ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', which share the character of [[List of recurring characters in Friends#Ursula Pamela Buffay|Ursula Buffay]]. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), a setting ([[New York City]]) and a schedule (''Friends'' initially followed ''Mad About You'' on [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV|Thursday night schedule]]).

''Mad About You'' and ''Friends'' share another type of "network crossover." On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover "event." In one case, a New York City [[Power outage|blackout]] caused by [[Paul Reiser]]'s character on ''Mad About You'' was experienced by the characters on ''Friends'' and ''[[Madman of the People]]''.<ref>[http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml epguides.com listing for ''Pandora's Box'', the episode which kicked off "Blackout Thursday" on NBC.]</ref> Such "event nights" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] attempted this kind of "event night" crossover with its [[TGIF (ABC)|Friday night programming]] during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' should chase her cat, [[Salem Saberhagen|Salem]], through ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[You Wish (TV series)|You Wish]]'' and ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'' because it had run away with a "time ball" that was displacing each show through time.<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/timeball.html Friday night programming with Sabrina the Teenage Witch and her cat, Salem.]</ref>

[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] used the show he was producing ''[[Zoey 101]]'' to promote his new show ''[[ICarly]]'' by making characters from ''Zoey 101'' go to ''ICarly.com'' or use the song ''Leave It All To Me'', the ICarly theme song as a ringtone.

=====Narrative rationales for crossovers=====
On other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective [[John Munch]] (from NBC's ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'') on Fox's ''[[The X-Files]]'' happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on ''The X-Files'' to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series ''[[Law & Order]]'' on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. Later, when ''Homicide'' went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' until October 2013.

A two-part crossover episode between ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' with ''[[Without a Trace]]'' aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on ''CSI'' and the second hour was on ''Without a Trace''.<ref name="crossover">{{cite web|url=http://www.csifanatic.com/2007/07/31/a-csi-without-a-trace-crossover|title=A CSI Without a Trace Crossover|work=CSIfanatic.com|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Without a Trace'' was shown on [[Channel 4]] and ''CSI'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes.<ref name="crossover">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/13/tvratings.television|title=CSI Vegas gamble pays off for Five|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-02-12|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|date=February 13, 2008}}</ref> Another ''CSI'' crossover occurred in 2009 when [[Raymond Langston]] from ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' appeared both in ''[[CSI: Miami]]''<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Bone Voyage| episodelink = Bone Voyage| series = CSI: Miami| serieslink = CSI: Miami| airdate = 11-09-09| season = 8| number = 7}}</ref> and ''[[CSI: NY]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Hammer Down| episodelink = Hammer Down| series = CSI: NY| serieslink = CSI: NY| airdate = 11-11-09| season = 6| number = 7}}</ref> traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' had a crossover with ''[[Third Watch]]'' which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers.<ref>[http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22810 MentalFloss]</ref>

In 2013, the Canadian crime drama series ''[[Republic of Doyle]]'' and ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'' produced a crossover,<ref name=doylemurdoch>[http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/ "Celebrating the Can-combo of Republic of Doyle and Murdoch Mysteries"]. ''[[National Post]]'', November 25, 2013.</ref> which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; ''Murdoch Mysteries'' is a historical series set in the 1890s, while ''Republic of Doyle'' is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as ''relatives'' of their primary characters; [[Allan Hawco]] appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of ''Murdoch Mysteries'' as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while [[Yannick Bisson]] appeared on a January 2014 episode of ''Republic of Doyle'' as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.<ref name=doylemurdoch />

=====Crossovers in children's television=====
Disney Channel's ''Suite Life'' franchise has featured three crossovers: in 2007, ''[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]'' featured characters from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[That's So Raven]]'' taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''); [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]]/[[Miley Stewart]] ([[Miley Cyrus]]) also eats cake off Zack, which recurs in the 2009 crossover ''[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]'', in which characters from ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'' and ''Hannah Montana'' come on aboard the S.S. Tipton.

Another type of crossover involves characters from an off the air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the [[Nickelodeon]] sitcom ''[[iCarly]]''; the episode "iStart a Fan War" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and ''[[Zoey 101]]'' character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between ''[[Victorious]]'' and ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] making an appearance. An episode titled "iParty with Victorious" was a crossover between ''[[iCarly]]'' and ''[[Victorious]]''. This means all four shows exist in the same universe. However, in an episode of ''Victorious'', Tori referred to ''Drake and Josh'' as a TV show, suggesting the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show.

The main characters of ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' make a crossover appearance in the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, "[[Ghost Story (Rugrats)|Ghost Story]]". This is because both shows were created/produced by [[Klasky Csupo]] and distributed also by Nickelodeon{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

====Special usages====

=====Promotional cameos=====
Crossovers can take the form of a promotional [[cameo appearance]], used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[A Star Is Burns]]'', in which the character of Jay Sherman (from ''[[The Critic]]'') appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before ''The Critic'' began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of ''The Simpsons'' as existing to promote ''The Critic'', an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.<ref>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html Various reactions, including Matt Groening's, to ''A Star Is Burns'']</ref>

The character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series ''[[Vega$]]'' appeared in an episode of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' ("Angels in Vegas") one week prior to the debut of ''Vega$''. However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna  was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an ''ABC TV Movie of the Week'' on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of ''Vega$'' as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' appeared in the fourth season premier of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' ("Love Boat Angels").

In 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of ''[[Coronation Street]]'', characters in fellow established TV soap ''[[EastEnders]]'' made reference to watching the special anniversary episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1388625_review_coronation_street_live_drama_was_so_gripping_even_dot_cotton_tuned_in |title=Review: Coronation Street live drama was so gripping, even Dot Cotton tuned in - Manchester Evening News |publisher=Menmedia.co.uk |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year.

====Spin-offs====
{{See also|List of television spin-offs}}
In its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when [[Cliff Huxtable]] of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' visited his daughter, [[Denise Huxtable|Denise]], on ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''. Another example of this is ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', which was a spin-off from ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. [[Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]] was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a [[Parachuting|skydiving]] accident, but her life was saved by [[Oscar Goldman]] ([[Richard Anderson]]) and Dr. Rudy Wells ([[Martin E. Brooks]]) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]]. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' characters to ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'' in [[Los Angeles]] from [[Sunnydale]] There is also [[Frasier]], which has features characters from the first show, [[Cheers]].

More complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the [[Star Trek crossovers|''Star Trek'' universe]], where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the [[Klingon]]s [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] (from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode "[[Errand of Mercy]]"), [[Koloth]] (from "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]") and [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]] (from "[[Day of the Dove]]"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] appeared together in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode, "[[Blood Oath (DS9 episode)|Blood Oath]]" - as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, [[Arne Darvin]], appeared as a secondary character in "The Trouble with Tribbles", but was the principal villain of DS9's "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, "Trials and Tribble-ations" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the ''[[USS Defiant|Defiant]]'', Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with [[Kirk]], [[Spock]] and the rest of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' crew.

The distinction between "spin-off" and "crossover" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'' is a spin-off of ''[[Happy Days]]'', or whether the star of ''Out of the Blue'' merely crossed over into ''Happy Days''.

=====Parodic crossovers=====
Often, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by [[situation comedies]] that wish to crossover with [[television drama|dramatic television]] programmes. The satirical crossover—ranging in length from a cameo to a full [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] or episode—is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious [[parody]] or [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a [[narrative]] point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other programme.

Such [[tongue-in-cheek]] crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.
* Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside of the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', which was largely accepted as being outside of standard ''X-Files'' continuity.
* One episode of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'' shows that after Mandy smiles, she, along with Billy and Grim, are transformed into [[The Powerpuff Girls]] with a cameo by Professor Utonium.
* They can occur by virtue of a [[dream sequence]], in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of ''[[Newhart]]'' had been the dream of [[Bob Newhart]]'s character on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' appeared in a dream of a character on ''[[The King of Queens]]''.
* Parodic crossovers can take the form of "[[joke|gag]]" cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Characters from ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'' have appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to comment on a peewee football game. Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show, but not necessarily the character that the actor played. For instance, on the ABC/CBS show ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' during the closing credits of the episode "Scenes From a Mall" (Season 5, Episode 12), a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring [[Reginald VelJohnson]] is re-played, but this time with one of the child actors stating that he "looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince," referring to [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]] who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC's ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson, Avery walked onto the set with an angry look, being in on the staged joke himself. Ended the episode (but with the cameras filming still), VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smilingly greeted the public.
* Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programmes, such as when [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] found and ate [[Bart Simpson]]'s shorts on ''[[Futurama]]'', or [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] had a talking Bender doll on ''The Simpsons''. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories.
* Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside of ''either'' series. This occurs most commonly on a [[sketch comedy]] show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors — for example, a sketch on ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' saw Yasir and Sarah from ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'' buying the gas station from ''[[Corner Gas]]'', with ''all'' characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows' real actors — although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show's own stable of actors. Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience — and in no way considered a part of either show's continuity — due to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programmes quickly and inexpensively. When [[Patrick Stewart]] appeared in a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/''[[The Love Boat]]'' crossover on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', for instance, few ''Star Trek'' fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event "counted" as an episode of the show. However, there are some cases of this type of parody having some [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] resonance with viewers. For instance, the British charity appeal, [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the typical sketch show. Many of these ''Relief'' sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programmes being parodied, and hence appear to be "normal" episodes. A good example of this is the sketch, "BallyKissDibley", an 11-minute piece in which the leads of ''[[Ballykissangel]]'' appeared on the sets of  ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', alongside most of ''Dibley'''s cast. Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character, the extent to which these parodies "count" as part of either show's canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers.
* Parodic crossovers can be used to lend [[verisimilitude]] to the fictional world of a programme. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as [[game show]]s or [[reality show]]s. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' once appeared on ''[[Family Feud]]'' and the townsfolk of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' have had their [[heirloom]]s valuated on ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', for instance. In such cases, it is generally the non-fictional show which ends up being the most satirized, due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements. However, these crossovers can happen on dramatic television, such as when ''[[Blue Peter]]'' provided [[Exposition (literary technique)|narrative exposition]] on ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''. Rarely, brief crossovers between two fictional programmes can be used for this same purpose. In the episode, "[[Army of Ghosts]]", [[Peggy Mitchell]] was seen in a fictionalized scene from ''[[EastEnders]]'' in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of ''[[Doctor Who]]'''s [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Here, too, time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme (''EastEnders'') and not the host programme (''Doctor Who'').

=====Retroactive crossovers=====
Sometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of [[autism|autistic]] character, Tommy Westphall's, imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous ''other'' crossovers, linkages can be found from ''Elsewhere'' to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called "the [[Tommyverse]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Unofficial crossovers==
In contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of [[Fanfiction|fan-written fiction]] and [[fan art]], but it is increasingly prevalent in [[fan film|amateur films]] and [[radio drama|audio]]. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to [[injunction|enjoin]] the distribution of such material.

A good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film ''[[Batman: Dead End]]'', which brings together the properties of ''Batman'', ''[[Alien (film series)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' in one setting.

Unofficial crossovers can also occur in a "what-if" scenario. The most notable is an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' entitled "[[Lois Kills Stewie]]" which turned out to be a simulation along with the previous episode "[[Stewie Kills Lois]]". [[Stewie Griffin]] is confronted by [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] and [[List of American Dad! characters#C. I. A.|Avery Bullock]] from ''[[American Dad!]]'' while hacking into the central power grid at the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in a latest plan for world domination. Stewie mistakes Stan for [[Joe Swanson]], due to notable similarities between the two shows. Stewie threatens to turn off all the electricity in the world until Stan and Bullock fulfill his demands of being "President of the World", which they do. Even though this never really happened, this is considered by some to mark the first official appearance of ''American Dad!'' characters in a ''Family Guy'' episode.  [[Roger (American Dad)|Roger]] makes frequent cameo appearances in ''Family Guy'', while [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] makes cameos on ''American Dad!''. Roger, [[Rallo Tubbs]], and [[Klaus Heissler]] were seen in the final ''Family Guy'' ''Star Wars'' spoof, "[[It's A Trap!]]", as an Imperial Officer, [[Nien Nunb]], and [[Admiral Ackbar]], respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in [[Road to the North Pole]].

''[[Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds]]'' introduces the famous detective to the scene of London occupied by Martian invaders, as depicted by [[H. G. Wells]], the crossover facilitated by the fact that both works, set in late Victorian London, are now in the public domain and can be freely used and modified.

Fan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as ''Star Wars'' vs. ''Star Trek'' or ''Babylon 5'' vs. ''Stargate''. [[M.U.G.E.N.]] is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.
