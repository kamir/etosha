<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE DETAIL TO THIS SUMMARY, but instead adjust what is already present. Plot summaries should be a maximum of 700 words according to WP:FILMPLOT; this summary in preview form is a little more than 600 words as of 28 July 2012. -->
In 2006, [[Brooklyn]] Congressman David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the [[United States Senate]]. While rehearsing his concession speech, David meets Elise Sellas, and they share a passionate kiss, though he does not get her name. Inspired by her, David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received, making him a favorite for the 2010 Senate race.

A month later, David prepares for a new job. At [[Madison Square Park]], near David's home, a man named Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from Richardson, his boss: ensure David spills coffee on his shirt by 7:05 AM so he misses his bus. Mitchell falls asleep and misses David, who encounters Elise again on the bus and gets her phone number. David arrives at work to find his friend Charlie Traynor frozen in time and being examined by unfamiliar men in suits. David attempts to escape, but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse. Richardson explains he and his men are from the "Adjustment Bureau". They ensure people's lives proceed as determined by "the Plan", a complex document Richardson attributes to "the Chairman".<ref name="Caseworkers 1">{{cite web|url = http://www.kansascity.com/2011/03/03/2694442/the-adjustment-bureau-damon-and.html|title =‘Adjustment Bureau’: The surreal feels real|publisher = [[The Kansas City Star]]|quote=Are you angels?” he asks Richardson. “We’ve been called lots of things,” is the reply. “Think of us as case workers.”|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref><ref name="Caseworkers 2">{{cite web|url = http://frontrow.dmagazine.com/2011/03/matt-damon-defies-gods-insidious-bureaucracy-in-the-adjustment-bureau/|title =Matt Damon Defies God’s Insidious Bureaucracy in The Adjustment Bureau |publisher = [[D Magazine]]|quote=You see, "the Chairman" (as the film calls the being responsible for managing the entire universe) has dispatched "case workers" to keep humanity moving according to his carefully choreographed plan.|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref> The Bureau confiscates and destroys the note that contains Elise's phone number, and David is warned that if he ever reveals the existence of the Bureau to anyone else, he will be "reset"—akin to being [[lobotomy|lobotomized]]&mdash;and that he is not meant to meet Elise again.

Three years later, after boarding a bus, David encounters Elise; he tells her he had spent three years riding that bus to work,  hoping to see her again. He learns that she dances for [[Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet]]. The Bureau tries to stop him from renewing their relationship by altering their schedules. David races across town, fighting the Bureau's abilities to "control his choices" to ensure he will meet Elise. During the chase the Bureau uses ordinary doorways to travel instantly to locations many blocks away. Senior official Thompson takes over David's adjustment and takes him to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path.

Thompson says humanity received [[free will]] after the [[Pax Romana|height of the Roman Empire]], but then brought the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] upon itself. The Bureau took control again after five centuries of barbarism with no signs of it ending, and created the [[Renaissance]], [[the Enlightenment]], and the [[scientific revolution]], but when free will was once again granted in 1910 it resulted in [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]], [[Fascism]], and the [[Holocaust]], again forcing the Bureau to retake control. Thompson implies that without Elise's influence David might become [[President of the United States]] and benefit the world, and warns that if he stays with her, he will ruin both of their futures. Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle at a performance to demonstrate his power, and David abandons her at the hospital to save them from the fate Thompson described.

Eleven months later, Charlie tells David of Elise's imminent wedding as he campaigns again. Harry contacts David via secret meetings in the rain or near water, which prevents the Bureau from tracking them. Harry reveals that Thompson exaggerated the negative consequences of David and Elise's relationship, and teaches David how to use doors to [[Teleportation|teleport]], and evade the Bureau's adjustments. Just before the wedding David reaches Elise, reveals the Bureau's existence to her, and shows her how he travels through doors. The Bureau pursues them across New York City. David decides to find the Chairman to end the chase; Elise wavers briefly, but accompanies David. They enter the Bureau's offices with the agents in pursuit.

David and Elise find themselves trapped and surrounded on the [[GE Building#Top of the Rock|observation deck of the GE Building]]. They mutually declare their love and kiss before David can be reset. When they let go of each other, the Bureau members have gone. Thompson appears but is interrupted by Harry, who shows him a revised Plan from the Chairman: one that is blank starting with the current moment. After commending them for their devotion to each other, Harry tells the couple they are free to leave. The film concludes with David and Elise walking through the streets, as Harry speculates that the Chairman's goal may be to prepare humanity so it can write its own "Plans".

Nolfi worked with John Toll as his cinematographer. Shots were planned in advance with storyboards, but changed often during shooting to fit the conditions of the day. The visual plan for the film was to keep the camerawork smooth using a dolly or crane and have controlled formal shots when the Adjustment Bureau was in full control, with things becoming more loose and using hand-held cameras when the story becomes less controlled.<ref name="collider">{{cite web

The final scene on the "[[GE Building#Top of the Rock|Top of the Rock]]" rooftop observation deck of the [[GE Building]] in [[Rockefeller Center]] was filmed four months after the rest of the film had completed shooting and has a different ending from the original.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mix949.com/ileanas-movie-review-the-adjustment-bureau/ |title=Ileana’s Movie Review: The Adjustment Bureau |work=mix949.com |first=Ileana |last=Williams |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref>

== Original ending ==
According to Nolfi there was an [[alternative ending]] that featured the Chairman:<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interview-george-nolfi-the-adjustment-bureau.php | title=Interview: George Nolfi Talks ‘The Adjustment Bureau’| first=Jack|last= Giroux | date= March 3, 2011| publisher= [[Film School Rejects]]| accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref>
<blockquote>[I]nitially I was going to show the Chairman. The Chairman was going to be in female form, too. Ultimately, while making the movie, I realized how important it was going to be for people to put their own beliefs in the end and not foreclose that. I don’t think the scene would have foreclosed peoples' [sic] beliefs, but the more I could hint at it and the less explicit I could be about it, it wasn’t enough to hint about it in the dialog and have an actual person there acting it. I just had to not show the Chairman, so I ended up not going that way.</blockquote>

More than two years later, another explanation was made public. In her 2013 memoir,<ref>{{cite book| title= The Alley of Love and Yellow Jasmines| isbn= 9780062009807| publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper]]| location= New York, NY | year=2013| first=Shohreh|last= Aghdashloo |authorlink=Shohreh Aghdashloo}}</ref> [[Iranian American]] actress [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]], the woman who portrayed the Chairman in the original ending, said Nolfi gave her an explanation that differs from what he had said in 2011, upon the film's release; he blamed [[Universal Pictures]] for the change to the ending:<ref>{{cite web| url= http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/01/entertainment/la-et-mn-aghdashloo-conversation-20130602 | title= Shohreh Aghdashloo, from Tehran to Hollywood | date= June 1, 2013|first= Irene|last= Lacher| publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref>
<blockquote>I loved that role. As actors, we all know we're at the mercy of the editing table, but not to this extent, never had I experienced it. The director, George Nolfi, decided I should play God. Everything went great until I got a call from the director who was asking to have lunch with me. He was on the verge of crying. He said, the [[film distributor|distribution company]] believes that you cannot play this role.</blockquote>

== Religious themes ==
Some reviewers identified [[Abrahamic]] theological implications, such as an [[omnipotent]] and [[omniscient]] God,<ref name="Judeo-Christian 1">{{cite web|url = http://www.catholicnews.com/data/movies/11mv024.htm|title =The Adjustment Bureau|publisher = [[Catholic News Service]] |quote=Though this is certainly not a film for young people—in addition to the quasi-theological issues underlying the story, David and Elise's liaison becomes physical prematurely—the metaphysical elements of the plot can be interpreted by mature viewers in a way that squares with Judeo-Christian faith.|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref><ref name="Judæo-Christian 2">{{cite web|url = http://www.jewishjournal.com/film/article/finally_an_action_thriller_for_religious_thinkers_20110307/|title =Finally, an Action Thriller for Religious Thinkers|publisher = [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]]|quote=Even rarer are those films that tackle theological dilemmas, like the age-old apparent contradiction of free will vs. determinism.

Does man truly possess free will, or does he only have the "appearance" of free will? Did I truly decide of my own free will to marry my wife, or did God orchestrate a complex set of circumstances that forced my hand and caused me to fall in love with this wonderful woman in order to fulfill His unknowable Divine plan?
