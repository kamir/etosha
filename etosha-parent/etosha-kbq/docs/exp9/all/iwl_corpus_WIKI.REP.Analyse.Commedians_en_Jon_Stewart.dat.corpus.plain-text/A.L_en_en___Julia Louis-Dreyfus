==Career==

===1982–89: Early work and ''Saturday Night Live''===
[[File:The Golden Jubilee (1982).jpg|thumb|Louis-Dreyfus as a part of ''Saturday Night Live'''s Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee, alongside cast mates Brad Hall, Gary Kroeger and Paul Barrosse]]
As part of her comedic training, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in [[The Second City]], one of Chicago's best-known improvisation theatre groups (whose alumni include [[Alan Arkin]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Amy Poehler]] and [[Shelley Long]]). It was her performance with [[The Practical Theatre Company|the Practical Theatre Group]] at their "Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee" that led to her being asked to join the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' at the age of 21.

Louis-Dreyfus was subsequently a cast member on ''Saturday Night Live'' from 1982 to 1985, becoming the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time.<ref name="actors"/> During her time on ''SNL'' she appeared alongside several actors who would later rise to prominence, such as [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Jim Belushi]], [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Martin Short]]. It was during her tenure on ''SNL'' that she met writer [[Larry David]], who would later co-create ''Seinfeld''.<ref name="actors"/> More recently Louis-Dreyfus has commented that her casting on ''SNL'' was a "[[Cinderella]]-getting-to-go-to-the-ball kind of experience";<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.com.au/ustv/news/a356844/julia-louis-dreyfus-snl-made-me-feel-like-cinderella.html "Julia Louis-Dreyfus: 'SNL made me feel like Cinderella'"] December 20, 2011, Digital Spy</ref> however, she has also admitted that at times it was often quite tense, stating that she "didn't know how to navigate the waters of show business in general and specifically doing a live sketch-comedy show."<ref name="Coyle">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/10/AR2006051001779.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jake | last=Coyle | title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus to Host 'SNL' | date=May 11, 2006}}</ref>

Following her 1985 departure from ''SNL'', Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including the [[Woody Allen]]-directed ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986); ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]'' (1986), starring [[C. Thomas Howell]]; and ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989), in which she starred alongside fellow ''SNL'' alum [[Chevy Chase]]. In 1988 she was cast in the NBC sitcom ''[[Day by Day (TV series)|Day by Day]]'', which aired for two seasons before being cancelled.<ref>[http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/08/short-lived-shows-day-by-day-video/ "Short-Lived Shows: Day By Day - VIDEO"] May 8, 2008, AOL TV</ref>

===1990–98: The ''Seinfeld'' years===
In the early-1990s Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of [[Elaine Benes]] on NBC's ''[[Seinfeld]]''. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes.<ref name="actors"/> One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, "[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]", due to the fact that her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that [[NBC]] executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]] add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition of commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including [[Patricia Heaton]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and [[Megan Mullally]].<ref>[http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_150/164_special_feature.html "5 Things You Didn't Know: Seinfeld"] Askmen.com</ref>

On the "Notes About Nothing" featurette on the [[DVD]] package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut [[M&M's|M&M]] without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: "She cracks you up without breaking your nuts."

Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her a [[Golden Globe Award]], five [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]] and five [[American Comedy Awards]]. In 1996 she received the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/julia-louis-dreyfus Julia Louis-Dreyfus Emmy Nominated]. Emmys.com.</ref> for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions.<ref name="imdb.com">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000506/awards "Awards for Julia Louis-Dreyfus"] at IMDb</ref> After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a "shocker", and that after being in both positions, it was "much better to win than to lose."<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/julia_louis-dreyfus/biography Bio] Celebrity Central/Top 25 Celebs, People Magazine</ref>

In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/16/arts/rating-for-seinfeld-finale-grazed-super-bowl-country.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Carter | title=Rating for 'Seinfeld' Finale Grazed Super Bowl Country | date=May 16, 1998}}</ref>

During her time on ''Seinfeld'' she appeared in several films, including ''[[Fathers' Day (film)|Fathers' Day]]'', opposite [[Robin Williams]] and [[Billy Crystal]], and [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-nominated ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.

===1999–2004: Post-''Seinfeld''===
Following a voice role in the successful [[Disney]] [[Pixar]]'s ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', Louis-Dreyfus lent her voice as [[Snake (The Simpsons)|Snake]]'s girlfriend Gloria in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love]]". In 2001, she made several special guest appearances on ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David's show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', playing herself fictionally trying to break the "curse" by planning to star in a show in which she would play an actress affected by a ''Seinfeld''-like curse.

After several years away from a regular TV gig, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom ''[[Watching Ellie]]'' which premiered on NBC in February 2002. The series was created by husband [[Brad Hall]], and co-starred [[Steve Carell]] and Louis-Dreyfus' half-sister [[Lauren Bowles]]. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a "slice of life" from the goings-on and happenings of the life of Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen which many critics panned, claiming it was useless and "did nothing for the show."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917072?refCatId=32 | work=Variety | first=Phil | last=Gallo | title=Watching Ellie | date=February 23, 2002}}</ref> Overall the show received mixed reviews, but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of approximately 10 million viewers per week.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-05-28-year-end-chart.htm "How did your favorite show rate?"]</ref>

When the series returned for a second season in the spring of 2003 the series had suffered somewhat of a decline in viewership, averaging around 8 million viewers per week. Moreover, the show had undergone a drastic stylistic change between production of season one and two. The first season was filmed in the single-camera format, but the second season was presented as a traditional multi-camera sitcom filmed in front of a live studio audience.<ref name=op>[http://old.post-gazette.com/tv/20030414owen0414fnp4.asp "TV Review: NBC's retooled 'Ellie' vastly more watchable"] April 14, 2003, Post Gazette</ref> With dwindling viewership and failing to retain the numbers from its ''[[Frasier]]'' lead-in, the series was cancelled by NBC in May 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/NBC-s-fall-lineup-is-looking-a-lot-like-its-1114511.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Melanie | last1=Mcfarland | title=NBC's fall lineup is looking a lot like its current one | date=November 5, 2003}}</ref>

Following NBC's cancellation of ''Watching Ellie'', the media began circulating rumours of a so-called "[[Seinfeld curse]]" which claimed that none of the former ''Seinfeld'' actors could ever achieve success again in the television industry. Louis-Dreyfus dismissed the rumour as "a made-up thing by the media",<ref name=op/> while ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David asserted that the curse was "completely idiotic."<ref>[http://www.gregbaerg.com/articles/David.html "'Curb's' Larry David: 'Seinfeld' Curse 'Idiotic'"] Zap2It.com. (via Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service) (September, 2001)]. Gregbaerg.com (September 7, 2001).</ref>

Louis-Dreyfus was interested in the role of Susan Mayer on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'',  the role that ultimately went to [[Teri Hatcher]].<ref>[http://www.aoltv.com/2006/05/04/desperate-networks-is-a-must-read-for-tv-fans/ "Desperate Networks is a must-read for TV fans"] May 4, 2006, Huffington Post</ref> Instead, Louis-Dreyfus scored a recurring guest role as the deceitful prosecutor and love interest of [[Michael Bluth]] on the Emmy-winning comedy ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', from 2004 to 2005.

===2005–10: ''The New Adventures of Old Christine'' and renewed success===
In 2005, it was announced that Louis-Dreyfus had been cast in the title role of a new CBS sitcom ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]''.<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/159094-CBS_Slates_4_Midseason_Shows.php "CBS Slates 4 Midseason Shows"] November 22, 2005, Jim Benson &ndash; Broadcasting & Cable</ref> The series and its concept was created by writer and producer of ''[[Will & Grace]]'', Kari Lizer.

The series debuted on CBS in March 2006 to an audience of 15 million and was initially a ratings winner for the network.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/news/old-christine-does-all-right-3666/ "Old Christine does all right"] March 14, 2006, TV.com</ref>

Louis-Dreyfus also received considerable critical acclaim for her performance on the show, with Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stating that Louis-Dreyfus broke the "''Seinfeld'' curse" "with one of the best conventional half-hours to come along in a while."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117929901?refCatId=32 | work=Variety | first=Brian | last=Lowry | title=The New Adventures of Old Christine | date=March 9, 2006}}</ref> Alessandra Stanley from ''[[the New York Times]]'' asserted that Louis-Dreyfus' performance on the series proved she is "one of the funniest women on network television."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/arts/television/13stan.html | work=The New York Times | first=Alessandra | last=Stanley | title=Seinfeld's Buddy Elaine Is a Divorced Mom Now, and Her Name Is Christine | date=March 13, 2006}}</ref> Louis-Dreyfus additionally earned the 2006 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] for her performance in the first season.

In 2007, she also received two nominations for a [[People's Choice Award]] due to her return to popularity, thanks to the success of ''Old Christine''.<ref name="imdb.com"/>
