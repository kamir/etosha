'''Sir Michael Caine''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ({{IPAc-en|k|eɪ|n}}; born '''Maurice Joseph Micklewhite'''; 14 March 1933), is an English actor and author. Renowned for his distinctive [[Cockney]] accent, Caine has appeared in over 115 films and is one of the UK's most recognisable actors.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/30/caine.october/ "Screening Room Special: Michael Caine""]. CNN. Retrieved 22 January 2013</ref>

He made his breakthrough in the 1960s with starring roles in a number of acclaimed British films, including ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' (1964), ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'' (1965), ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' (1966), for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969), and ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' (1969). His most notable roles in the 1970s included ''[[Get Carter]]'' (1971), ''[[The Last Valley (1970 film)|The Last Valley]]'', ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972), for which he earned his second Academy Award nomination, ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' (1975), and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977). He achieved some of his greatest critical success in the 1980s, with ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983) earning him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]]. In 1986 he received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in Woody Allen's ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]''.

Caine played [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992). Having by that time practically retired from acting on the big screen, he enjoyed a career resurgence in the late 1990s, receiving his second Golden Globe Award for his performance in ''[[Little Voice (film)|Little Voice]]'' in 1998 and receiving his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' the following year. Caine played [[Nigel Powers]] in the 2002 parody ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', and more recently portrayed [[Alfred Pennyworth]] in [[Christopher Nolan]]'s [[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan series|''Batman'' film series]], and appeared in several other of Nolan's films including ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), and ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'' (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in [[Alfonso Cuarón]]'s ''[[Children of Men]]'' and [[Pixar]]'s 2011 film ''[[Cars 2]]''.

Caine is one of only two actors nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for acting in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s (the other one being [[Jack Nicholson]]; [[Laurence Olivier]] was also nominated for an acting Academy Award in five different decades, beginning in 1939 and ending in 1978). In 2000, Caine was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in recognition of his contribution to cinema.

Caine had a maternal half-brother, David William Burchell (11 July 1925–March 1992) and a full brother, [[Stanley Caine|Stanley Micklewhite]] (1936–2013). Caine grew up in [[Southwark]], South London, and during the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[North Runcton]] near [[King's Lynn]] in Norfolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runctonweb.co.uk/mcaine.html |title=Michaorfolk childhood |publisher=Runctonweb.co.uk|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> After the war, his father was [[demobilization|demobilised]], and the family were rehoused by the council in Marshall Gardens at the [[Elephant and Castle]] in a [[Prefabricated home|pre-fabricated house]] made in Canada,<ref>Michael Caine, ''My Autobiography: The Elephant to Hollywood'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 2011), p. 28.</ref> as much of London's housing stock had been damaged during [[the Blitz]] in 1940–41.

From 28 April 1952, when he was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|called up]] to do his [[national service]] until 1954, he served in the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Fusiliers]], first at the [[British Army of the Rhine|BAOR]] HQ in [[Iserlohn]], Germany and then on active service during the [[Korean War]].

==Career==

===1950s===

Caine's acting career began at the age of 20 in [[Horsham]], [[Sussex]] when he responded to an advertisement in ''[[The Stage]]'' for an assistant stage manager who would also perform small [[Bit part|walk-on parts]] for the Horsham-based Westminster Repertory Company who were performing at the [[Horsham#Town centre|Carfax]] Electric Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenhorsham.co.uk/30/electrictheatre.htm |title=Horsham Carfax Electric Theatre&nbsp;– Hidden Horsham |publisher=Hidden Horsham |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> Adopting the stage name "Michael Scott", in July 1953 he was cast as the drunkard Hindley in the Company's production of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.<ref>Interview with Mike Ostler by Roxanne Blakelock (15 October 2004) for the [[British Library]] Theatre Archive Project at www.bl.uk. Retrieved 4 January 2012</ref> He moved to the [[Lowestoft]] Repertory Company in [[Suffolk]] for a year when he was 22. It was here that he met his first wife.<ref>The Actors – Sir Michael Caine Q&A, Indie London at www.indielondon.co.uk. Retrieved 4 January 2012</ref>
He has described the first nine years of his career as "really, really brutal."<ref>Rob Carnevale, The Prestige – Michael Caine Interview, Indie London at www.indielondon.co.uk. Retrieved 4 January 2012</ref>

When his career took him to London in 1954 after his provincial apprenticeship, his agent informed him that there was already a Michael Scott performing as an actor in London and that he had to come up with a new name immediately. Speaking to his agent from a [[telephone box]] in [[Leicester Square]], London, he looked around for inspiration, noted that ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'' was being shown at the [[Odeon Cinema]] in 1954, and decided to change his name to "Michael Caine". He joked on television in 1987 that, had a tree partly blocking his view been a few feet to the left, he might have been called "Michael Mutiny". ([[Humphrey Bogart]] was his "screen idol" and he would later play the part originally intended for Bogart in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Caine|first=Michael|title=The Elephant to Hollywood|year=2011|publisher=Henry Holt & Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-9390-2|page=6}}</ref>) He also later joked in interviews that had he looked the other way, he would have ended up as "Michael [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]".<ref>{{cite news|author=Close |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,445597,00.html |title=Michael Caine (I) |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 October 2009 | location=London | date=2 March 2001}}</ref> (This quip is obviously tongue-in-cheek as the film ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians'' was not made until seven years later in 1961). In 1959, he was [[Peter O'Toole]]'s understudy in [[Lindsay Anderson]]'s West End staging of [[Willis Hall]]'s ''The Long and the Short and the Tall''. He took over the role when O'Toole left to make ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and went on to a four-month tour of Britain and Ireland.

Michael Caine's first film role was as one of the privates in [[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]]'s platoon in the 1956 film ''[[A Hill in Korea]]''. The stars of the film were [[George Baker (actor)|George Baker]], [[Stanley Baker]], [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Michael Medwin]], with [[Stephen Boyd]] and [[Ronald Lewis (actor)|Ronald Lewis]], and [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] also had a small part.

===1960s===
[[File:Michael-caine-trailer.jpg|thumb|left|369px|Michael Caine in trailer for ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' (1964)]]
A big break came for Caine when he was cast as Meff in James Saunders' [[Cockney]] comedy ''Next Time I'll Sing To You'', when this play was presented at the [[New Arts Theatre]] in London on 23 January 1963.<ref>{{cite web|title=Next Time I'll Sing To You|last=Saunders |first=James|url=http://www.jamessaunders.org/jsnext.htm|year=1962|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> Scenes from the play's performance were featured in the April 1963 issue of ''Theatre World'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phyllis.demon.co.uk/theatricalia/14mags/thw60s.htm |title=ROB WILTON THEATRICALIA Theatre World Magazines 1960s |publisher=Phyllis.demon.co.uk |date=4 December 1965 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

When this play moved to the [[Criterion Theatre|Criterion]] in [[Piccadilly]] with [[Michael Codron]] directing, he was visited backstage by [[Stanley Baker]], one of the four stars in Caine's first film, ''A Hill in Korea'', who told him about the part of a Cockney private in his upcoming film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'', a film Baker was producing and starring in. Baker told Caine to meet the director, [[Cy Endfield]], who informed him that he already had given the part to [[James Booth]], a fellow Cockney who was Caine's friend, because he looked more Cockney than Caine did. Endfield then told the 6'2" Caine that he did not look like a Cockney but like an officer, and offered him a screen test for the role of a snobbish, upper class officer after Caine assured him that he could do a [[posh accent]]. Caine believes Endfield offered him, a Cockney, the role of an aristocrat because, being American, he did not have the endemic British class-prejudice. Though he tested poorly, Endfield gave him the part that would make him a film star.<ref>{{cite book|last=Caine|first=Michael|title=The Elephant to Hollywood|year=2011|publisher=Henry Holt & Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-9390-2|pages=50–52}}</ref>

Retrieved 14 January 2012</ref> According to his 2011 autobiography ''The Elephant to Hollywood'', Caine had been signed to a seven-year contract by [[Joseph E. Levine]], whose [[Embassy Pictures|Embassy Films]] was distributing ''Zulu''. After the return of the cast to England and the completion of the film, Levine released him from the contract, telling him, "I know you're not, but you gotta face the fact that you look like a queer on screen." Levine gave his contract to his ''Zulu'' co-star James Booth.<ref>Caine p.62</ref>

Subsequently, Caine's agent got him cast in the BBC production ''[[Hamlet at Elsinore]]'' (1964) as [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]], in support of [[Christopher Plummer]]'s Hamlet. Horatio was the only classical role which Caine, who had never received dramatic training, would ever play. Caine wrote, "...I decided that if my on-screen appearance was going to be an issue, then I would use it to bring out all Horatio's ambiguous sexuality."<ref>Caine p.63</ref>

Caine's roles as effete-seeming aristocrats were to contrast with his next projects, in which he was to become notable for using a [[Regional accents of English|regional accent]], rather than the [[Received Pronunciation]] hitherto considered proper for film actors. At the time, Caine's working class [[Cockney]], just as with [[The Beatles]]' [[Liverpudlian]] accents, stood out to American and British audiences alike. ''Zulu'' was closely followed by two of his best-known roles: the spy [[Harry Palmer]] in ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'' (1965), and the womanising title character in ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' (1966). He went on to play Palmer in a further four films, ''[[Funeral in Berlin (film)|Funeral in Berlin]]'' (1966), ''[[Billion Dollar Brain]]'' (1967), ''[[Bullet to Beijing]]'' (1995) and ''[[Midnight in Saint Petersburg]]'' (1995). Caine made his first film in the United States in 1966, after an invitation from [[Shirley MacLaine]] to play opposite her in ''[[Gambit (1966 film)|Gambit]].'' During the first two weeks, whilst staying at [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]], he met long-term friends [[John Wayne]] and agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|"Swifty" Lazar]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2006928.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Best of Times Worst of Times Michael Caine | date=1 July 2007 | accessdate=5 April 2010 | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}</ref>

===1970s===
[[File:Get-carter-trailer.jpg|thumb|250px|Michael Caine in trailer for ''Get Carter'' (1971)]]
After working on ''[[The Italian Job]]'' with [[Noël Coward]], and a solid role as [[RAF]] fighter pilot [[Squadron Leader]] Canfield in the all-star cast of ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' (both 1969), Caine played the lead in ''[[Get Carter]]'' (1971), a British gangster film. Caine was busy with successes including ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972) opposite [[Laurence Olivier]], and ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' (1975) co-starring [[Sean Connery]] and directed by [[John Huston]] (which he has stated will be the film he wishes to be remembered for after his death). In 1976 he appeared in the screen adaptation by [[Tom Mankiewicz]] of the [[Jack Higgins]] novel ''[[The Eagle Has Landed]]'' as ''[[Oberst]]'' ([[Colonel]]) Kurt Steiner, the commander of a [[Luftwaffe]] paratroop unit disguised as Polish [[paratrooper]]s, whose mission was to kidnap or kill the then-[[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], alongside co-stars [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Jenny Agutter]] and [[Donald Pleasence]]. Subsequently in 1978, he starred in [[Silver Bears (film)|''The Silver Bears'']], an adaptation of Paul Erdman's (1974) novel of the same name. Caine also was part of an all-star cast in ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977).

===1980s===
By the end of the decade, he had moved to the United States, but his later choice of roles was frequently criticised{{mdash}}something to which he has referred to with self-deprecating comments about taking parts strictly for the money. Caine then averaged two films a year, but these included such failures as the [[BAFTA Award]]-nominated ''[[The Magus (film)|The Magus]]'' (1968), the [[Academy Award]]-nominated ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'' (1978), ''[[Ashanti (1979 film)|Ashanti]]'' (1979) (which he claimed were his worst three films), ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1979), ''[[The Island (1980 film)|The Island]]'' (1980), ''[[The Hand (film)|The Hand]]'' (1981) and a reunion with his ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' co-star [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[The Jigsaw Man (film)|The Jigsaw Man]]'' (1982).
[[File:Lumet-Caine-1982.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Sidney Lumet]] and Caine at the set for ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'', 1982]]
Although Caine also took better roles, including a [[BAFTA]]-winning turn in ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983), an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning one in ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986),<ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Thomas |title=Three-time loser Caine becomes Oscar winner |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&dat=19870430&id=DucrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lwUGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3349,7713188 |newspaper=Kentucky New Era |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Google News Archive |date=30 April 1987 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe]]-nominated one in ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]'' (1988), he continued to appear in poorly received films such as ''[[Blame It on Rio]]'', the [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian Le Frenais]] comedy ''[[Water (1985 film)|Water]]'', the critical-commercial flop ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'' (1987) (about which he had mixed feelings concerning the production and the final cut), and ''[[Bullseye!]]'' (1990); his appearing in so many films that did not meet with critical or box office acclaim made him the butt of numerous jokes on the subject. Of "Jaws: The Revenge", Caine said "I have never seen the film, but by all accounts it was terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/michael_caine_biog/25|title=Michael Caine Biography|publisher=Tiscali}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Collin|first=Robbie|author-link=Robbie Collin|date=March 14, 2013|title=Michael Caine: Extraordinarily good and spectacularly awful|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9926680/Michael-Caine-extraordinarily-good-and-spectacularly-awful.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}</ref> His other successful films (critically or financially) were the 1978 [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'', the 1980 [[Golden Globe]]-nominated [[slasher film]] ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', the 1981 [[war film]] ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', the 1982 film ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'', and the 1986 [[Academy Award]]-nominated ''[[Mona Lisa (film)|Mona Lisa]]''.

FIFA Films. Retrieved 28 January 2013</ref> He also starred in ''[[Without a Clue]]'', portraying [[Sherlock Holmes]] and also acted as Chief Insp. Frederick Abberline in the 1988 TV series 'Jack the Ripper'.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, he found good parts harder to come by. He played the mysterious bartender Mike in ''[[Mr. Destiny]]'' in 1990. A high point came when he played [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in the critically acclaimed ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992). He played the beleaguered stage director Lloyd Fellowes in the film adaptation of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). He also played a villain in the [[Steven Seagal]] film ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' (1994). He was in two [[straight to video]] Harry Palmer sequels and a few television films. However, Caine's reputation as a pop icon was still intact, thanks to his roles in films such as ''The Italian Job'' and ''Get Carter''. His performance in ''[[Little Voice (film)|Little Voice]]'' (1998) was seen as something of a return to form, and won him a [[Golden Globe Award]]. Better parts followed, including ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' (1999), for which he won his second [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12134280 "Sir Michael Caine collects top French honour"].

[[File:Michael Caine handprints, Leicester Square WC2 - geograph.org.uk - 1352187.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Michael Caine's handprints in [[Leicester Square]], London]]

Caine has been Oscar-nominated six times, winning his first [[Academy Award]] for the 1986 film ''Hannah and Her Sisters'', and his second in 1999 for ''The Cider House Rules'', in both cases as a supporting actor. His performance in ''Educating Rita'' in 1983 earned him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]].

He was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1992 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52952|supp=yes|startpage=7|date=12 June 1992|accessdate=5 December 2008}}</ref> and in the [[2000 New Year Honours]] he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] as ''Sir Maurice Micklewhite CBE''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=55879|supp=yes |startpage=1|date=19 June 2000|accessdate=5 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=56136 |startpage=2633|date=2 March 2001|accessdate=5 December 2008}}</ref> In 2000 he received a [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/707630.stm "Kubrick and Caine honoured"]. BBC. Retrieved 14 July 2012</ref> On 5 January 2011, Caine was made a Commander of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by France's culture minister, [[Frédéric Mitterrand]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/01/06/arts/AP-EU-France-Michael-Caine.html?hp|title=France Bestows Culture Honor on Michael Caine|date= 6 January 2011|work=The New York Times |accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, he was awarded the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Showbusiness at the [[Variety Club]] Awards.<ref name="Variety">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7732843.stm|title=Variety Club honours actor Caine|date=17 November 2008|work=BBC News  |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=17 November 2008}}</ref>
In May 2012 he was awarded the Honorary [[Freedom]] of the [[London Borough of Southwark]] as a person of distinction and eminence of the borough.<ref>http://www.southwark.gov.uk</ref>

==In popular culture==
Known for having a distinctive voice and manner of speaking, Caine is a popular subject for impressionists and mimics.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29475358 'My name is...': Sir Michael Caine mimics the impersonators"]. BBC. Retrieved 24 December 2014</ref> Most Caine impressions include the catchphrase "Not a lot of people know that." [[Peter Sellers]] initiated this when he appeared on BBC1's ''[[Michael Parkinson|Parkinson]]'' show on 28 October 1972 and said: "Not many people know that. This is my Michael Caine impression. You see, Mike's always quoting from the ''Guinness Book of Records''. At the drop of a hat he'll trot one out. 'Did you know that it takes a man in a tweed suit five and a half seconds to fall from the top of Big Ben to the ground?' Now there's not many people who know that!". The line had been used earlier in [[Spike Milligan]]'s script for ''[[The Last Goon Show of All]]'', performed on 5 October 1972.<ref>''The Last Goon Show of All'' [http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/ajwills/raw/LastGoonShowofAll.html Homepages.paradise.net.nz]</ref> In 1983, Caine was given the line to say as a joke in the film ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]''.

The British comedy sketch show, ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'', included a series of sketches in which [[Paul Whitehouse]] played a character called Michael Paine; an amalgam of previous Michael Caine impressions, who in a reference to [[The Ipcress File]] wears oversized, thick-rimmed glasses and a trench coat. He introduces himself with the line, "My name is Michael Paine, and I am a nosy neighbour" and in a spoof of the stakeout at the beginning of [[The Ipcress File]], recounts to the camera the 'suspiciously' mundane behaviour of his neighbours, before saying, "Not a lot of people know that I know that".

Caine himself parodied the phenomenon in an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]], imitating others' impressions of him and including the catchphrase.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/07/michael-caine-impersonate_n_805852.html "Michael Caine Impersonates Michael Caine", ''[[Huffington Post]]'']</ref>

A parody of Michael Caine also appears in the animated series ''[[Ugly Americans (TV series)|Ugly Americans]]'', in the episode "The Dork Knight", which also parodies the film ''The Dark Knight''. In the episode, Caine appears as himself, portrayed in the light of his Alfred Pennyworth interpretation, and constantly annoys the protagonists with endless anecdotes of his career.

[[The Trip (2010 TV series)|The Trip]], starring [[Rob Brydon]] and [[Steve Coogan]], featured improvised scenes in which the two leads argue over who can do the better Michael Caine impression. Among the lines they repeat in their attempts to outdo each other are, "You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" and, "She was only sixteen" – from ''[[The Italian Job]]'' and ''[[Get Carter (1971 film)|Get Carter]]'', respectively.

[[Craig Ferguson]] has run segments on his show where he parodies Caine, usually while wearing a [[space suit]].<ref>[http://scottishking.blogspot.com/2009/02/michael-caine-in-space.html Scottishking]</ref>

Some time after his mother died, Caine and his younger brother, [[Stanley Caine|Stanley]], learned they had an elder half-brother, named David. He suffered from severe [[epilepsy]] and had been kept in [[Cane Hill|Cane Hill Mental Hospital]] his entire life. Although their mother regularly visited her first son in the hospital, even her husband did not know the child existed. David died in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/577:584/1/Michael_Caine.htm |title=Michael Caine |publisher=The Biography Channel |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>

Proceeds from the books went to the [[National Playing Fields Association]] (now Fields in Trust) of which Caine was a prominent supporter.

==Politics==
Caine has often been outspoken about his political views. He left the United Kingdom for the United States in the late 1970s, citing the 83% [[income tax]] levied on top earners by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]], but returned to the UK eight years later after taxes had been lowered by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]:

{{quote|I decided not to become a [[tax exile]], so I stayed in Britain, but they kept putting the tax up, so I'd do any old thing every now and then to pay the tax, that was my tax exile money. I realised that's not a democratic country, it's a communist country without a dictator, so I left and I was never going to come back. Maggie Thatcher came in and put the taxes back down and in the end, you know, you don't mind paying tax. What am I going to do? Not pay tax and drive around in a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]], with cripples begging on the street like you see in some countries?<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/Caine-comes-circle/story-12649493-detail/story.html | title= Caine comes full circle | work=[[Essex Chronicle]] | date=9 November 2009 | accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>}}

Following the launch of his film ''[[Harry Brown (film)|Harry Brown]]'', Caine called for the reintroduction of [[national service]] in the UK to give young people "a sense of belonging rather than a sense of violence".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Harry-Brown-Star-Sir-Michael-Caine-Says-Put-Young-People-In-The-Army-To-Stop-Escalating-Violence/Article/200911215451202?f=rss |title=Harry Brown Star Sir Michael Caine Says Put Young People in the Army To Stop Escalating Violence |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

In 2009, Caine publicly criticized the Labour government of [[Gordon Brown]] for its newly introduced 50 per cent income tax rate on top earners and threatened to return to the US if his taxes were increased further.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5221192/Michael-Caine-The-Government-has-reached-its-limit-with-me.html | title= Michael Caine:'The Government has reached its limit with me' | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=25 April 2009 | accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> During the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], Caine publicly endorsed the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and appeared with party leader [[David Cameron]] for the launch of a civilian non-compulsory "National Service" for 16-year-olds, although he claimed he had previously supported [[New Labour]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8617149.stm | work=BBC News | first=Kevin | last=Young | title=Political celebrities: Then & now | date=20 April 2010}}</ref> In July 2014, Caine was reported to have been a celebrity investor in a tax avoidance scheme called Liberty.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/george-michael-and-michael-caine-accused-of-tax-avoidance-through-liberty-scheme-9594976.html|title=George Michael and Michael Caine accused of tax avoidance through Liberty scheme|work=The Independent|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

==Musical career==
Caine is a fan of [[chill-out music]] and released a compilation CD called ''Cained'' in 2007 on the [[UMTV]] record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umtv.co.uk/release.php?id=524 |title=Various Artists – Cained |publisher=UMTV |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref><ref name="wiredcained">{{cite web|last=Van |first=Eliot |url=http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2007/09/actormixtape-ma |title=Actor Michael Caine Releases Chill Compilation: Cained |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> He met [[Elton John]] and was discussing musical tastes, when Caine claimed that he had been creating chillout [[mixtape|mix tapes]] as an amateur for years.<ref name="wiredcained"/><ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2174336.ece Michael Caine to release chill-out album] ''The Times''.
