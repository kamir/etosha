'''Gene Rayburn''' (December 22, 1917 &ndash; November 29, 1999) was an American [[radio]] and [[television]] personality. He is best known as the host of various editions of the popular American television game show ''[[Match Game]]'' for over two decades.

==Background==
Born '''Eugene Jelyevich'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=John|title=Cat Whiskers and Talking Furniture: A Memoir of Radio and Television Broadcasting|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786436972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79bOhN089foC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq}}</ref> in [[Christopher, Illinois]], he was the only child of [[Croatia]]n immigrants. Rayburn's father died when was he was an infant and his mother moved to [[Chicago]], where she met Milan Rubessa. After she married Rubessa, Rayburn took the name '''Eugene Rubessa''' {{IPAc-en|r|uː|ˈ|b|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clothier|first=Gary Lee|title=Mr. Know-It-All: '18 Wheels of Justice' series|newspaper=Daily Breeze|date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> Rayburn graduated from [[Robert Lindblom Math & Science Academy|Lindblom Technical High School]] and later from [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. While a student at Lindblom, he was senior class president and acted in the plays ''Robert of Sicily'', and ''Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch''.<ref>Lindblom Technical High School, Class yearbook January 1936</ref>

Rayburn was married to Helen Ticknor from 1940 until her death in October 1996. They had one child, a daughter, Lynn. After Lynn's birth, Rayburn enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] and served in [[World War II]].

When selecting the name Rayburn, Gene chose it by randomly sticking a finger in the phone book.

==Radio career==
[[File:Gene Rayburn Dee Finch 1951.JPG|thumb|Rayburn and Finch, 1951]]
Before appearing in television, Rayburn was a very successful actor and radio performer. He had a popular morning [[drive time]] radio show in [[New York City]], first with [[Jack Lescoulie]] (''Anything Goes'') and later with Dee Finch (Rayburn & Finch) on WNEW (now [[WBBR]]). Radio history pegs Rayburn's pairings with Lescoulie and Finch as one of the first two-man teams in morning radio.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} When Rayburn left WNEW, Dee Finch continued the format with [[Gene Klavan]].

Rayburn later landed the lead in the Broadway musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' when Dick Van Dyke left the production to star in his eponymous classic sitcom ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.

==Television career==
Breaking into television as the original announcer on [[Steve Allen]]'s ''Tonight'', Gene Rayburn began a long association with game-show producers [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in 1953. He first appeared on [[Robert Q. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Name's the Same]]''; Rayburn frequently sat in for regular panelist [[Carl Reiner]], lending a comic touch to the panel. In 1955, he took over as host of the summer replacement game show, ''[[Make the Connection]]'', from original host, [[Jim McKay]]. From there he hosted shows such as ''[[Choose Up Sides]]'', ''[[Dough Re Mi]]'', and the daytime version of ''[[Tic Tac Dough]]''. On radio, Rayburn became one of the many hosts of the NBC program ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' in 1961 and remained with the show until 1973.

In an uncredited role (he reportedly did not want his name to appear), Rayburn played a TV interviewer in the 1959 movie, ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'' starring [[Doris Day]].

Rayburn was also a frequent panelist in the 1960s and 1970s on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', where the interviewing skills he had burnished on ''Monitor'' made him a popular questioner.

==''The Match Game''==
From 1962 to 1969 Rayburn hosted ''[[Match Game|The Match Game]]''. In the original version, which aired from New York on [[NBC]], Rayburn read questions to two panels, each consisting of a celebrity and two audience members. The questions in the original game were ordinary, like "Name a kind of muffin," or "John loves his ____________." Rayburn usually played it straight, though he would make jokes as the situation warranted. Because it was a live show, very few episodes were recorded for posterity; only four are known to exist. The show was cancelled in 1969 to make room for the topical, short-lived game show ''[[Letters to Laugh-In]]''.

Goodson-Todman revived ''The Match Game'' in 1973 for CBS, this time as a [[California]]-based game show. Gene Rayburn returned as host, and introduced a new format in which two contestants tried to match the responses of six celebrities. Writer [[Dick DeBartolo]], a veteran of the original show, created funnier and often risqué questions ("After being hit by a steamroller, Norman had to slide his ____________ under the door.") Rayburn reveled in this freewheeling new approach, and often indulged in funny voices, banter with the celebrities, and mock arguments with the technical crew. Millions tuned in, and it soon became the highest-rated show in daytime television history.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

From 1973 to 1977, ''The Match Game'' was #1 among all daytime network game shows &mdash; three of those years it was the highest rated of ''all'' daytime shows.

The daytime revival of ''The Match Game'', which featured regular panelists [[Richard Dawson]], [[Brett Somers]] and [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], ran until 1979 on CBS and another three years in first-run syndication. A concurrent night-time version, ''Match Game PM'', aired from 1975 to 1980. Rayburn was nominated for two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] for Outstanding Host or Hostess in a Game or Audience Participation Show. <!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:GeneRayburn GSN 1979.png|thumb|200px|right|Gene Rayburn and a happy contestant in 1979.]] -->

During the years when ''The Match Game'' was taped in Los Angeles, Rayburn lived in [[Osterville, Massachusetts]], on [[Cape Cod]], and would commute to California every two weeks and tape 12 shows over the course of a weekend (five daytime shows and one nighttime show per taping day).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1983, a year after the syndicated ''Match Game'' disappeared,  the show was revived as part of the ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'', with Rayburn hosting the Match Game segment and sitting on the panel of the ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' segment (a unique case of a host directly participating in the gameplay). The show lasted nine months on NBC.

Rayburn knitted socks as a publicity stunt during his time on ''Rayburn and Finch'', and later became proficient at needlepoint; he used the time on long plane rides from New York to Los Angeles with his hobby. In 1974, Goodson made a surprise on-air appearance to congratulate Rayburn on making the show #1 among daytime television programs, and presented him with a needlepoint bag.

During his time in the Air Force, Rayburn was trained in [[meteorology]] and occasionally demonstrated his knowledge of the weather on ''Match Game''.  Rayburn was also a dedicated tennis enthusiast, and often made subtle references to the sport on the show.

==Other game shows/television appearances==
During and between his ''Match Game'' years, Rayburn served as guest panelist on two other Goodson-Todman shows, ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''. Also during the run of the 1970s ''Match Game'', Gene and wife Helen appeared on the game show ''Tattletales'', hosted by [[Bert Convy]]. Three years after the original ''Match Game'' was cancelled, Rayburn hosted the short-lived [[Heatter-Quigley Productions]] show, ''[[The Amateur's Guide to Love]]''. In 1983 he hosted a pilot for [[Reg Grundy Productions]] called ''Party Line'', which later became ''[[Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak]]''.

Rayburn appeared as a contestant during a tournament of game show hosts on the original version of ''[[Card Sharks]]'' in 1980 and was a celebrity guest on ''[[Password Plus]]'' several times between 1980 and 1982.

Rayburn appeared on ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' as a game-show host &mdash; he and another host played by Jan Murray were game show rivals who vied to win the woman they both loved by creating the ultimate game show, with life-or-death consequences.

Rayburn once hosted a local New York City-based show on [[WNEW-TV]] (now WNYW), ''Helluva Town,'' and between game show stints in 1982-83 he returned to WNEW as host of a weekly local talk/lifestyles show called ''Saturday Morning Live''. He ended his brief tenure to return as co-host of ''The Match Game/Hollywood Squares Hour''.

Rayburn's last game show hosting duties were on 1985's ''[[Break the Bank (1985)|Break the Bank]]'' (he was replaced by [[Joe Farago]] after 13 weeks), and ''[[The Movie Masters]]'', an [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] [[cable]] game show that ran from 1989 to 1990.

Just before production was to begin on a new Rayburn-emceed ''Match Game'' revival in 1985, an ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' reporter publicly disclosed that Rayburn was much older than many believed. Rayburn had trouble finding jobs after that, blaming the reporter for revealing his age and subjecting him to [[ageism|age discrimination]].

Rayburn was a guest star on the 2/24/1979 episode of The Love Boat playing a love interest to Fannie Flagg.

Rayburn portrayed himself on a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch in 1990, which featured [[Susan Lucci]] (as her character from ''[[All My Children]]'', [[Erica Kane]]). He returned as one of Kane's many previous husbands, to stop another marriage (officiated by his old "[[Choose Up Sides]]" co-star [[Don Pardo]]) with the host of a game show portrayed by [[Phil Hartman]]. He also continued to make appearances on talk shows throughout the late 1980s and 90s, usually to discuss classic game shows, including appearances on ''[[Vicki Lawrence|Vicki!]]'' and ''[[Maury (TV series)|The Maury Povich Show]]'' and ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show with Ross Shafer]]''. Coincidentally, Shafer would host the 1990 ''Match Game'' revival.

Gene Rayburn co-hosted—with his wife and Peter Emmons—the Drum Corps International (DCI) finals of the DCI Championship for two years, which were telecast nationwide on PBS from
Philadelphia's [[Franklin Field]] in 1976, and Denver's old [[Mile High Stadium]] in 1977.

==Death==
Rayburn's last TV appearance was a 1998 interview with ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the hit CBS game show ''Match Game''. Portions of the interview have been rebroadcast on the [[Game Show Network]], which in 2001 showed portions of another previously unaired interview during the first airing of its ''Match Game Blankathon''.

Though in poor health, Rayburn appeared in person to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]. A month later, he died at his daughter's [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] home of [[congestive heart failure]] on November 29, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bauder|first=David|title=Match Game' host Rayburn dies|newspaper=The World|date=December 3, 1999}}</ref> He was cremated and his ashes spread in the garden of his daughter's home.
