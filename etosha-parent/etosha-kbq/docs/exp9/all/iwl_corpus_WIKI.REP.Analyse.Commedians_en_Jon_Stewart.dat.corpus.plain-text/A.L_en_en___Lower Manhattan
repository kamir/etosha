'''Lower Manhattan''', also known as '''Downtown Manhattan''', is the southernmost part of the island of [[Manhattan]], the main island and center of business and government of the [[New York City|City of New York]], which itself originated at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in 1624.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepinnaclelist.com/blog/directory/manhattan-new-york-some-of-the-most-expensive-real-estate-in-the-world-overlooks-central-park/|title=Manhattan, New York – Some of the Most Expensive Real Estate in the World Overlooks Central Park|publisher=The Pinnacle List|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
Lower Manhattan is defined most commonly as the area delineated on the north by [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], on the west by the [[Hudson River]], on the east by the [[East River]], and on the south by [[New York Harbor]] (also known as [[Upper New York Bay]]). When referring specifically to the Lower Manhattan business district and its immediate environs, the northern border is commonly designated by thoroughfares approximately a mile-and-a-half south of 14th Street and a mile north of the island's southern tip: [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] from near the Hudson east to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] entrances and overpass. Two other major arteries are also sometimes identified as the northern border of "Lower" or "Downtown Manhattan": [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], roughly half a mile north of Chambers Street, and [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], roughly half a mile north of 14th Street. 

The Lower Manhattan business district forms the core of the area below Chambers Street. It includes the [[The Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]] (often referred to as [[Wall Street]], after its primary artery) and the [[World Trade Center]] site. At the island's southern tip is [[Battery Park]]; [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] is just to the north of the Financial District. Also south of Chambers Street are the [[planned community]] of [[Battery Park City]] and the [[South Street Seaport]] historic area. The neighborhood of [[TriBeCa]] straddles Chambers on the west side; at the street's east end is the giant [[Manhattan Municipal Building]]. North of Chambers Street and the Brooklyn Bridge and south of Canal Street lies most of New York's oldest [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] neighborhood. Many [[New York City Courts|court buildings]] and [[Foley Square|other government offices]] are also located in this area. The [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] neighborhood straddles Canal. North of Canal Street and south of 14th Street are the neighborhoods of [[SoHo]], the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], the [[West Village, Manhattan|West Village]], [[Greenwich Village]], [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]], [[NoLIta, Manhattan|Nolita]], and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. Between 14th and 23rd streets are lower [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], the [[Flatiron District]], [[Gramercy, Manhattan|Gramercy]], and the large residential development [[Peter Cooper Village—Stuyvesant Town]] in the eastern part.

The area that would eventually encompass modern day New York City was inhabited by the [[Lenape]] people.  These groups of culturally and linguistically identical [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] traditionally spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language now referred to as ''[[Unami language|Unami]]''.

European settlement began with the founding of a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[fur trade|fur trading]] post in Lower Manhattan, later called [[New Amsterdam]] ({{lang-nl|Nieuw-Amsterdam}}) in 1626.<ref name=LowerManhattanHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2122.html|title=United States History – History of New York City, New York|publisher=Online Highways LLC|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=New York: the World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}</ref> The first fort was built at the [[Battery Park|Battery]] to protect [[New Netherland]].<ref name=NYCPR>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=7712 |title="Battery Park".

Soon thereafter, most likely in 1626, construction of [[Fort Amsterdam]] began.<ref name=NYCPR/> Later, the Dutch West Indies Company imported African slaves to serve as laborers; they helped to build the wall that defended the town against English and Indian attacks. Early directors included [[Willem Verhulst]] and [[Peter Minuit]]. [[Willem Kieft]] became [[Director-General of New Netherland|director]] in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in [[Kieft's War]] against the Native Americans. The [[Pavonia Massacre]], across the Hudson River in present day [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] resulted in the death of 80 natives in February 1643.  Following the massacre, [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch. The Dutch Republic sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft, leading to the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans and a peace treaty on August 29, 1645.<ref name="ellis-p37">{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |pages=37–40}}</ref>

On May 27, 1647, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] was inaugurated as director general upon his arrival and ruled as a member of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. The colony was granted self-government in 1652, and New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1653.<ref name="ellis-p57">{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |page=57}}</ref> The first mayors (''burgemeesters'') of New Amsterdam, Arent van Hattem and Martin Cregier, were appointed in that year.<ref>Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.),''Exploring Historic Dutch New York''.

In 1664, the English conquered the area and [[Geographical renaming|renamed]] it "New York" after the [[James II of England|Duke of York]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Historical Atlas of New York City: A Visual Celebration of 400 Years of New York City's History |author=Homberger, Eric |year=2005 |page=34 |publisher=Owl Books |isbn=0-8050-7842-8}}</ref> At that time, African slaves comprised 40% of the small population of the city.  Some had achieved freedom under the Dutch and owned {{convert|130|acres}} of farms in the area of present-day [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]].<ref name="Spencer">[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/afrburial/ Spencer P.M. Harrington, "Bones and Bureaucrats"], ''Archeology,'' March/April 1993, accessed 11 February 2012</ref> The Dutch briefly regained the city in 1673, renaming the city "New Orange", before permanently ceding the colony of [[New Netherland]] to the English for what is now [[Suriname]] in November 1674.

The new English rulers of the formerly Dutch New Amsterdam and New Netherland renamed the settlement New York. As the colony grew and prospered, sentiment also grew for greater autonomy. In the context of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England, [[Jacob Leisler]] led [[Leisler's Rebellion]] and effectively controlled the city and surrounding areas from 1689–1691, before being arrested and executed.

By 1700, the Lenape population of New York had diminished to 200.<ref name="gothamcenter.org">[http://www.gothamcenter.org/features/timeline/ "Gotham Center for New York City History"] Timeline 1700–1800</ref> By 1703, 42% of households in New York had slaves, a higher percentage than in [[Philadelphia]] or [[Boston]].<ref name = "hh_slavery">{{cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051107/slavery_in_new_york|quote = |title = The Hidden History of Slavery in New York|accessdate = 2008-02-11|work = The Nation |publisher = }}</ref>

The 1735 libel trial of [[John Peter Zenger]] in the city was a seminal influence on [[freedom of the press]] in North America. It would be a standard for the basic articles of freedom in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

After a series of fires in 1741, the city became panicked that blacks [[New York Conspiracy of 1741|planned to burn the city]] in a conspiracy with some poor whites. Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear, but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites, who over a period of months were convicted of arson. Of these, the city executed 13 blacks by burning them alive and hanged 4 whites and 18 blacks.<ref>{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |page =207 |url = |doi =  |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref>

In 1754, [[Columbia University]] was founded under [[charter]] by [[George II of Great Britain]] as King's College in Lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite book |title=An Historical Sketch of Columbia College, in the City of New York, 1754–1876 |author=Moore, Nathaniel Fish |year=1876 |page=8 |publisher=Columbia College}}</ref>

The [[Stamp Act]] and other British measures fomented dissent, particularly among [[Sons of Liberty]] who maintained a long-running skirmish with locally stationed British troops over [[Liberty Pole]]s from 1766 to 1776. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in New York City in 1765 in the first organized resistance to British authority across the colonies.  After the major defeat of the [[Continental Army]] in the [[Battle of Long Island]], General [[George Washington]] withdrew to Manhattan Island, but with the subsequent defeat at the [[Battle of Fort Washington]] the island was effectively left to the British.  The city became a haven for [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] refugees, becoming a British stronghold for the entire war. Consequently, the area also became the focal point for Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|espionage and intelligence-gathering]] throughout the war.

In 1771, Bear Market was established along the Hudson shore on land donated by Trinity Church, and replaced by Washington Market in 1813.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Public Market for Lower Manhattan |publisher=New York City Council |url=http://www.nyccouncil.info/pdf_files/reports/publicmarket.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

New York City was greatly damaged twice by [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|fires]] of suspicious origin during British military rule.  The city became the political and military center of operations for the British in North America for the remainder of the war and a haven for Loyalist refugees. [[Continental Army]] officer [[Nathan Hale]] was hanged in Manhattan for [[espionage]]. In addition, the British began to hold the majority of captured American [[prisoners of war]] aboard [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|prison ships]] in [[Wallabout Bay]], across the [[East River]] in [[Brooklyn]].  More Americans lost their lives from neglect aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war.  British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783.  George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day, as [[Evacuation Day (New York)|the last British forces left the city]].

Starting in 1785, the [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] met in New York City under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. In 1789, New York City became the first [[List of capitals in the United States#United States|national capital of the United States]] under the new [[United States Constitution]]. The Constitution also created the current [[Congress of the United States]], and its first sitting was at [[Federal Hall]] on Wall Street. The first [[United States Supreme Court]] sat there. The [[United States Bill of Rights]] was drafted and ratified there.  George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall.<ref>{{cite web | title = The People's Vote: President George Washington's First Inaugural Speech (1789) | publisher = U.S. News and World Report | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page11.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref> New York City remained the capital of the U.S. until 1790, when the role was transferred to Philadelphia.

New York grew as an economic center, first as a result of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s policies and practices as the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]] and, later, with the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, which connected the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|Atlantic port]] to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior.<ref>{{cite book |author = Bridges, William | title = Map of the City of New York and Island of Manhattan with Explanatory Remarks and References | year=  1811}}</ref><ref name="lankevich-p67">Lankevich (1998), pp. 67–68.</ref> [[History of immigration to the United States|Immigration]] resumed after being slowed by wars in Europe, and a new [[street grid]] system, the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], expanded to encompass all of Manhattan.

Washington Market was located between Barclay and Hubert Streets, and from [[Greenwich Street]] to [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Restless Ports for the City's Food |author=Millstein, Gilbert |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 24, 1960}}</ref> The area remains one of the few parts of Manhattan where the street [[grid system]] is largely irregular. Throughout the early decades of the 1900s, the area experienced a construction boom, with major towers such as [[40 Wall Street]], the [[American International Building]], [[Woolworth Building]], and [[20 Exchange Place]] being erected.

On March 25, 1911, the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in [[Greenwich Village]] took the lives of 146 garment workers, which would eventually lead to great advancements in the city's fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.  [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|Interborough Rapid Transit]] (the first [[New York City Subway]] company) began operating in 1904. The area's demographics stabilized, labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class, the city's government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under [[Fiorello La Guardia]], and his controversial parks commissioner, [[Robert Moses]], ended the blight of many tenement areas, expanded new parks, remade streets, and restricted and reorganized [[Zoning in the United States|zoning controls]], especially in Lower Manhattan.

In the 1950s, a few new buildings were constructed in lower Manhattan, including an 11-story building at 156 William Street in 1955.<ref name="nyt-12251960">{{cite news |title=Building Activity Soars Downtown |author=Bartnett, Edmond J. |work=The New York Times |date=December 25, 1960}}</ref> A 27-story office building at 20 Broad Street, a 12-story building at 80 Pine Street, a 26-story building at 123 William Street, and a few others were built in 1957.<ref name="nyt-12251960"/>  By the end of the decade, lower Manhattan had become economically depressed, in comparison with [[midtown Manhattan]], which was booming.  [[David Rockefeller]] spearheaded widespread [[urban renewal]] efforts in lower Manhattan, beginning with construction [[One Chase Manhattan Plaza]], the new headquarters for his bank.  He established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA) which drew up plans for broader revitalization of lower Manhattan, with the development of a [[worldwide world trade center|world trade center]] at the heart of these plans. The original DLMA plans called for the "world trade center" to be built along the [[East River]], between Old Slip and [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]].  After negotiations with [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Richard J. Hughes]], the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] decided to build the [[World Trade Center]] on a site along the [[Hudson River]] and the [[West Side Highway]], rather than the East River site.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Through much of its history, the area south of Chambers Street was mainly a commercial district, with a small population of residents—in 1960, it was home to about 4,000.<ref name="nyt-01311960">{{cite news |title='Downtown' Enters a New Era |author=Brown, Charles H. |date=January 31, 1960 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Construction of [[Battery Park City]], on landfill from construction of the World Trade Center, brought many new residents to the area.

By the turn of the century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Since the early twentieth century, Lower Manhattan has been an important center for the arts and leisure activities. [[Greenwich Village]] was a locus of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture from the first decade of the century through the 1980s. Several of the city's leading jazz clubs are still located in Greenwich Village, which was also one of the primary bases of the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s. Many art galleries were located in SoHo between the 1970s and early 1990s; today, the downtown Manhattan gallery scene is centered in Chelsea. From the 1960s onward, lower Manhattan has been home to many alternative theater companies, constituting the heart of the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] community.  [[Punk rock]] and its derivatives emerged in the mid-1970s largely at two venues: [[CBGB]] on the [[Bowery]], the western edge of the East Village, and [[Max's Kansas City]] on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue South]]. At the same time, the area's surfeit of reappropriated industrial lofts played an integral role in the development and sustenance of the minimalist composition, [[free jazz]], and [[disco]]/[[electronic dance music]] subcultures. The area's many nightclubs and bars—though mostly shorn of the freewheeling iconoclasm, pioneering spirit, and [[do-it-yourself]] mentality that characterized the pregentrification era—still draw patrons from throughout the city and the surrounding region. In the early twenty-first century, the Meatpacking District, once the sparsely populated province of after-hours [[BDSM]] clubs and transgendered prostitutes, gained a reputation as New York's trendiest neighborhood.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/visitorsguide/neighborhoods/meatpacking.htm |author=Steinberg, Jon |title=Meatpacking District Walking Tour|date=2004-08-18|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref>

The storm and [[Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York|its effects]] have prompted the discussion of constructing [[seawall]]s and other [[coastal management|coastal barriers]] around the shorelines of Manhattan and the New York City metropolitan region to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/public/climatewire/2012/11/15/1|title=ADAPTATION: Political support for a sea wall in New York Harbor begins to form|author=Robert S.

Perhaps Lower Manhattan's most renowned landmark is now the former [[World Trade Center]] site. Before the [[September 11 attacks]], the Twin Towers were iconic of Lower Manhattan's global significance as a [[financial center]].  The new office towers (including [[One World Trade Center]]) are expected to restore the Lower Manhattan skyline and give it the title of the third largest central business district in the United States, behind [[Midtown Manhattan]] and the [[Chicago Loop]]. The [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|9/11 Memorial]] has become a popular draw for visitors.
  
The area contains many historical buildings and sites, including [[Castle Garden]], originally the fort [[Castle Clinton]], [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]], the old [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House|United States Customs House]], now the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], [[Federal Hall]], where [[George Washington]] was [[List of United States presidential inaugurations|inaugurated]] as the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Fraunces Tavern]], [[New York City Hall]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]], renovated original mercantile buildings of the [[South Street Seaport]] (and a modern tourist building), the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], [[South Ferry, Manhattan|South Ferry]], embarkation point for the [[Staten Island Ferry]] and ferries to [[Liberty Island]] and [[Ellis Island]], and [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]].  Lower Manhattan is home to some of New York City's most spectacular skyscrapers, including the [[Woolworth Building]], [[40 Wall Street]] (also known as the Trump Building), the [[Standard Oil]] Building at [[26 Broadway]], and the [[American International Building]].

Among the commercial districts of Lower Manhattan no longer in existence was [[Radio Row]] on Cortlandt Street, which was demolished in 1966 to make way for construction of the former World Trade Center.

''Downtown'' in the context of Manhattan, and of New York City generally, has different meanings to different people, especially depending on where in the city they reside. Residents of the island or of [[The Bronx]] generally speak of ''going'' "downtown" to refer to any southbound excursion to any Manhattan destination.<ref name="NYCV">[http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=365 NYC Basics], NYCvisit.com. Retrieved on December 2, 2007.</ref> A declaration that one is going to ''be'' "downtown" may indicate a plan to be anywhere south of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]—the definition of downtown according to the city's official tourism marketing organization<ref name="NYCV"/>—or even [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]].<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.timeout.com/newyork/file/visitor-info/listings.downtown.html Hotels: Downtown below 23rd Street], ''Time Out New York''; [http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?&aid=57528&search_result=1&stid=8 "Residents Angered By Bar Noise In Downtown Manhattan"], ''NY 1 News'', March 3, 2006. Both retrieved on December 3, 2007.</ref> The full phrase ''Downtown Manhattan'' may also refer more specifically to the area of Manhattan south of [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].<ref name="nyt-01311960"/> Within business-related contexts, many people use the term ''Downtown Manhattan'' to refer only to the Financial District and the corporate offices in the immediate vicinity. For instance, the [[Business Improvement District]] managed by the Alliance for Downtown New York defines Downtown as South of Murray Street (essentially South of [[New York City Hall]]), which includes the [[World Trade Center]] area and the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. The phrase ''Lower Manhattan'' may apply to any of these definitions: the broader ones often if the speaker is discussing the area in relation to the rest of the city; more restrictive ones, again, if the focus is on business matters or on the early colonial and post-colonial history of the island.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

As reflected in popular culture, "Downtown" in Manhattan has historically represented a place where one could "forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, and go Downtown," as the lyrics of [[Petula Clark]]'s [[1964 in music|1964]] hit "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" celebrate (although the artist later clarified that she naively believed [[Times Square]] to be "downtown," and was the actual inspiration for the hit single). The protagonist of [[Billy Joel]]'s [[1983 in music|1983]] hit "[[Uptown Girl]]" contrasts himself (a "downtown man") with the purportedly staid uptown world.<ref>''Downtown: Its Rise and Fall, 1880–1950'' by Professor Robert M Fogelson. Yale University Press, 2003. ISBN 0-300-09827-8. pg 3</ref> Likewise, the chorus of [[Neil Young]]'s 1995 single "Downtown" urges "Let's have a party, downtown all right."
