==Biography==
Calvin Trillin was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1935 to Edythe and Abe Trillin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2011/10/26/my-favorite-things-calvin-trillin/ |title=My Favorite Things: Calvin Trillin |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref> During an interview on the [[Charlie Rose Show]] on February 21, 2013 where he was discussing his book, ''Dogfight'', he said his parents called him "Buddy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12794 |title=Calvin Trillin |publisher=Charlie Rose |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref> He attended public schools in Kansas City and went on to [[Yale University]], where he was the roommate and friend of Peter M. Wolf, (for whose 2013 memoir, My New Orleans, Gone Away, he wrote an amusing foreword) and where he served as chairman of the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' and was a member of the Pundits and [[Scroll and Key]] before graduating in 1957;<ref>The Yale Banner, ''History of the Class of 1957''.</ref> he later served as a [[trustee|Fellow]] of the [[Yale Corporation|University]]. After a stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], he worked as a reporter for ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine before joining the staff of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/calvin_trillin/search?contributorName=calvin%20trillin |title=Contributors – Calvin Trillin |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref> His reporting for ''The New Yorker'' on the [[racial integration]] of the [[University of Georgia]] was published in his first book, ''An Education in Georgia''. He wrote the magazine's ''U.S. Journal'' series from 1967 to 1982, covering local events both serious and quirky throughout the United States.

He has also written for ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' magazine. He began in 1978 with a column called ''Variations,'' which was eventually renamed ''Uncivil Liberties'' and ran through 1985. The same name – ''Uncivil Liberties'' – was used for the column when it was syndicated weekly in newspapers, from 1986 to 1995. Essentially the same column then ran without a name in ''Time'' magazine from 1996 to 2001. His humor columns for ''The Nation'' often made fun of the editor of the time, [[Victor Navasky]], whom he jokingly referred to as ''the wily and parsimonious'' Navasky.  (He once wrote that the magazine paid "in the high two figures.")  From the July 2, 1990, issue of ''The Nation'' to today, Trillin has written his weekly "Deadline Poet" column – humorous poems about current events. Trillin has  written considerably more pieces for ''The Nation'' than any other person.

Family, travel and food are also themes in Trillin's work. Three of his books ''American Fried;'' ''Alice, Let's Eat;'' and ''Third Helpings;'' were individually published and are also collected in the 1994 compendium ''The Tummy Trilogy.''  In 1965, he married the educator and writer [[Alice Stewart Trillin]] with whom he had two daughters. Alice died in [[September 11 attacks|2001]].  The most autobiographical of his works are ''Messages from My Father'', ''Family Man'', and an essay in the March 27, 2006, ''New Yorker'', "Alice, Off the Page", discussing his late wife. A slightly expanded version of the latter essay, entitled ''About Alice,'' was published as a book on December 26, 2006. In ''Messages from My Father'', Trillin recounts how his father always expected his son to be a [[Jew]], but had primarily "raised me to be an American".<ref>Trillin, Calvin. [http://books.google.com/books?id=rEuYqL3zRQcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22calvin+trillin%22+jewish ''Messages from My Father''], p. 101. [[Macmillan Publishers]], 1997. ISBN 0-374-52508-0. Accessed August 31, 2011. ""My father took it for granted that I would always be Jewish, whatever the background of the person I married. On the other hand, he didn't exactly raise me to be a Jew; he raised me to be an American."</ref>

He has also written a collection of short stories – ''Barnett Frummer Is An Unbloomed Flower'' (1969) – and three comic novels, ''Runestruck'' (1977), ''Floater'' (1980), and ''Tepper Isn’t Going Out'' (2001). This last novel is about a man who enjoys parking in [[New York City]] for its own sake and is unusual among novels for exploring the subject of [[parking]].

In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected the essay ''Stranger with a Camera'' for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.

In 2012, he was awarded the Thurber Prize for American Humor for ''Quite Enough of Calvin Trillin: Forty Years of Funny Stuff'', published by Random House. In 2013, he was inducted into the [[New York Writers Hall of Fame]].

Trillin lives in the [[Greenwich Village]] area of [[New York City]].
