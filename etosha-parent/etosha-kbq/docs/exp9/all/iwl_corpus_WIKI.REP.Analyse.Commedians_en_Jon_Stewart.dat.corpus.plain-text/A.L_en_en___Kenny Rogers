==Career==

===Early career===
His career began in the mid-1950s when he recorded with a [[rockabilly]] group called The Scholars, who had some success with a single called "Poor Little Doggie." Rogers was not the lead singer of the group and after two more singles they disbanded when their leader went solo.
In a recording career dating back to 1950s, Kenny Rogers moved effortlessly from teenage rock'n'roll through psychedelic rock to become the consummate country-pop crossover artist of the 1970s and 1980s. Because of his career, he became the one of the highest paid entertainers in the world. At the same time, on his own, Kenneth Rogers (as he was billed then) followed the breakup with his own single, a minor solo hit called "That Crazy Feeling" (1958). After sales slowed down, Rogers joined a [[jazz]] group called [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|The Bobby Doyle Three]], who got a lot of work in clubs thanks to a reasonable fan following and also recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. The group disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called "[[Here's That Rainy Day]]" failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers; including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]]. In 1966 he joined [[The New Christy Minstrels]] as a singer and [[double bass]] player.

Feeling that the Minstrels were not offering the success they wanted, Rogers and fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams, and Thelma Camacho left the group. They formed [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]] in 1967 (later renamed "Kenny Rogers and The First Edition"). They chalked up a string of hits on both the pop and country charts, including "[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]," "[[But You Know I Love You]]," which [[Dolly Parton]] later covered,{1981} "[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]," "Tell It All, Brother," "Reuben James," and "Something's Burning." In his First Edition days, Rogers had something of a [[hippie]] image, sporting long brown hair, an earring, and pink sunglasses.

When the First Edition disbanded in 1976, Rogers launched his solo career. Rogers soon developed a more [[middle-of-the-road (music)|middle of the road]] sound, with a somewhat rough but tuneful voiced style that sold to both pop and country audiences; to date, he has charted more than 60 top 40 hit singles (including two #1's--"Lady" and "Islands In The Stream") and 50 of his albums have charted. His music has also been featured in top selling movie soundtracks, such as ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]],'' ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.<ref name="Big Lebowski soundtrack">{{cite web|title=The Big Lebowski: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Lebowski-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000001EYO|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Urban Cowboy Soundtrack">{{cite web|title=Urban Cowboy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|url=http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Cowboy-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000002H4B/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1336598742&sr=1-1|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Solo career===
[[File:Kenny Rogers Frontier Festival.jpg|thumb|Rogers performing at the University of Houston in 1981]]After leaving The First Edition in 1976, after almost a decade with the group, Rogers signed a solo deal with [[United Artists]]. Producer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]] and Rogers began a partnership that would last four years.<ref>{{cite news | author = Bill Friskics-Warren | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/arts/music/larry-butler-producer-for-kenny-rogers-dies-at-69.html | title = Larry Butler, Producer for Kenny Rogers, Dies at 69 | publisher = New York Times |date = January 24, 2012 | accessdate = October 10, 2012}}</ref>

Rogers first outing for his new label was ''Love Lifted Me.'' The album charted and two singles, "Love Lifted Me" and "While the Feeling's Good," were minor hits. The song "Runaway Girl" was featured in the motion picture ''[[Trackdown (film)|Trackdown]].'' Later in 1976, Rogers issued his second album, the self-titled ''Kenny Rogers,'' whose first single, "[[Laura (What's He Got That I Ain't Got)]]," was another solo hit.

The single "[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]" (1977) was a major hit, reaching number one on the pop charts in 12 countries, selling over five million copies, and firmly establishing Rogers' post-First Edition career. On the strength of "Lucille," the album ''Kenny Rogers'' reached No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard charts#Top Country Albums|Billboard Country Album Chart]]. More success was to follow, including the multi-million selling album ''[[The Gambler (album)|The Gambler]]'' and another international Number 1 single, "[[Coward of the County]]," taken from the equally successful album, ''Kenny.'' In 1980, the Rogers/Butler partnership came to an end, though they would occasionally reunite: in 1987 on the album ''I Prefer the Moonlight'' and again in 1993 on the album ''If Only My Heart Had a Voice.''

In the late 1970s, Rogers teamed up with close friend and Country Music legend [[Dottie West]] for a series of albums and duets. Together the duo won 2 gold records (1 of which later went platinum), 2 CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums "Every Time Two Fools Collide" (#1) and "Classics" (#3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them. Their hits together "[[Every Time Two Fools Collide (song)|Every Time Two Fools Collide]]" (#1), "Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight" (#2), "[[What Are We Doin' in Love]]" (#1), "All I Ever Need Is You" (#1) and "Till I Can Make It On My Own" (#3) all became Country standards. Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: "She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions." In a 1978 press release for their album "Every Time Two Fools Collide," Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography "Luck Or Something Like It." In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]].''

In 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], "[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer|Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer]]," became a major hit. (Rogers, Carnes, and Carnes's husband David Ellingson were all former members of "[[The New Christy Minstrels]]."{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Carnes and Ellingson had written and composed the selections of ''[[Gideon (album)|Gideon]],'' the source album of "Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer," specifically for Rogers himself.) Earlier that year, he sang a duet of "You and Me" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special '''Lynda Carter Special'''.  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit "[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]."<ref name=cmt1304/> Richie went on to produce Rogers's 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as "[[I Don't Need You]]" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), "[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and "[[Share Your Love with Me]]" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|single of the same name]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hit 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. due to its exposure as the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983 recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] "[[We've Got Tonight]]," a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a #1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.

He went on to work with the [[Bee Gees]] to record and produce his 1983 hit album ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]],'' featuring the title track and yet another No.&nbsp;1 hit "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]," a duet with [[Dolly Parton]]. The Gibbs originally wrote the song for [[Marvin Gaye]] in an R&B style, only later to change it for the Kenny Rogers album.<ref>Johnny Walker interview with Robin and Barry Gibb BBC Radio 2 30 August 2010 17:00</ref> The partnership with Bee Gees only lasted one album, which was not a surprise considering that Rogers's original intentions were to work with [[Barry Gibb]] in only one song, but Barry insisted on them doing the entire album.

"Islands in the Stream," Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until "[[Amazed]]" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping Billboard's country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album and TV special, ''[[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|Once Upon a Christmas]],'' as well as a 1985 duet "[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]," which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single "[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]".

Despite the success of "Islands in the Stream," however, RCA insisted on releasing ''Eyes''' title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) "Islands in the Stream" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. "Buried Treasure," "This Woman" and "Evening Star"/"Midsummer Nights" were also all successful singles from the album.

Shortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]], a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]], was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single "Crazy" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.

The next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including "Twenty Years Ago," "Morning Desire," "Tomb of the Unknown Love," among others.  On January 28, 1985 Rogers was one of the [[USA for Africa|45 artists]] who recorded the worldwide charity song "[[We Are the World]]" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name="Front Row King">{{cite web|title=Front Row King|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

In January 1987, Rogers co-hosted the [[American Music Awards]] at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. In 1988 Rogers won a grammy "Best Country Collaboration with Vocals" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]&nbsp;— "Make No Mistake, She's Mine." In the 1990s Rogers continued to chart with singles such as "Crazy In Love," another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, "If You Want To Find Love," and "The Greatest." His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991–94, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992–95, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat [[Grand Palace Theatre]]. In 1994, Rogers released his "dream" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/40s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with The Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1996 he released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final verrsion.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, [[onQ Music]]. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.

In 1999 Rogers scored with the single "The Greatest," a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game). The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success). In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, "We've Got It All," specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===After the 1990s===
[[Image:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Kenny Rogers in 2004]]
In the 21st century, Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single "[[Buy Me a Rose]]".<ref name=cmt1304/> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was 59 years and 11 months old when he scored with "Hello Love"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No. 1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], "[[Beer for My Horses]]".

Although Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, "My World Is Over" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and "We Are the Same".  "My World Is Over" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Kenny Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.

Rogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as "Crazy in Love" and "What About Me?"

Capitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was "[[I Can't Unlove You]]," which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of The First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. "I Can't Unlove You" was followed up with the second single from the album, "The Last Ten Years (Superman)", in September 2006. The third single, "Calling Me," which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.

As of 2011, Rogers has recorded 65 albums and sold over 165 million records.<ref>{{cite web|last=Malachowski|first=David|url=http://www.timesunion.com/default/article/Kenny-Rogers-plays-Christmas-music-and-his-own-868545.php|title=Kenny Rogers plays Christmas music and his own hits|publisher=Times Union|date=December 9, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Iain Shedden|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/countrys-singalong-king-kenny-rogers-swings-in/story-e6frg8n6-1225978936492|title=Country's singalong king Kenny Rogers swings in|publisher=The Australian|date=December 31, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

On August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A&nbsp;— Celebrates New Project with Old Classics.

The release is designed to celebrate Rogers' 50th year in the music business. In 2007 the [[England national rugby union team]] team adopted Rogers song "The Gambler" as their unofficial [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] anthem,<ref>{{cite web|last=Britten|first=Nick|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1565734/Kenny-the-Gambler-Rogers-backs-England.html|title=The Telegraph|publisher=The Telegraph|date=October 10, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> after hearing prop [[Matt Stevens (rugby union)|Matt Stevens]] playing it in the team hotel. Before the semi-final against France and the final against South Africa, Rogers sent video messages of support to the team in light of them choosing his song. He offered to come to England and party with the team if they won the World Cup.

In 2008 Rogers toured with his Christmas Show. He split the show up, making the first half his "best of" and the second half his Christmas songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mohegansun.com/2008/12/11/the-best-entertainers-are-heading-to-mohegan-this-holiday-season.html|title=Mohegan Sun Casino|publisher=Newsroom.mohegansun.com|date=December 11, 2008|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> In 2009 he toured the United Kingdom. In 2009, Rogers embarked on his 50th Anniversary Tour. The tour went around the United States, Britain and Ireland.

On April 10, 2010, a TV special was taped, ''Kenny Rogers: The First 50 Years''. [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Lionel Richie]] were among those set to perform with Rogers during a show celebrating his contribution to country, blues and pop music, It took place at the MGM Grand in Foxwoods. This special debuted on March 8, 2011 on Great American Country.

On June 10, 2012, Rogers appeared on stage with the musical group Phish to perform his hit song "The Gambler" at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Also in 2012, Rogers re-recorded the hit song "Lady", a duet with its songwriter Lionel Richie, on Richie's album ''[[Tuskegee (album)|Tuskegee]]''. The pair also performed the song live at the 2012 ACM concert, "Lionel Richie & Friends".

On April 10, 2013, the CMA announced that Rogers would be a 2013 inductee into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], along with [[Jack Clement|Cowboy Jack Clement]] and [[Bobby Bare]].<ref name=cmt1304/>
In June 2013 he performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2013|Glastonbury Festival]] in the Sunday afternoon 'Legends' slot.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jun/27/30-minutes-with-kenny-rogers|title= Kenny Rogers: 'I figured, someone asked for me, so here I come'|date=June 27, 2013|work=Guardian |accessdate=June 27, 2013 }}</ref>

In 2013, Kenny Rogers recorded a new album with the name ''[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]''. This album included the title track, a new duet with [[Dolly Parton]], which was his first charting single in six years.

==Acting==
Rogers also had success as an actor. His 1982 movie ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]'', in which he played a race-car driver, took more than $20 million at the United States box office, while made-for-TV movies such as ''[[The Gambler (film series)|The Gambler]]'', ''Christmas in America'', and ''Coward of the County'' (based on hit songs of his) topped ratings lists. He also served as host & narrator for the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] historical series "[[The Real West]]".

Rogers says that photography was once his obsession, before it morphed into a passion.  He has authored the photo books ''Kenny Rogers' America'' (1986) and ''Your Friends and Mine'' (1987).<ref>Mario Tarradell, [http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/mario-tarradell/20100716-kenny-rogers-is-enthusiastic-about-his-50th-anniversary-special.ece "Kenny Rogers is enthusiastic about his 50th anniversary special"], ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' (July 16, 2010).</ref>

As an entrepreneur, he collaborated with former [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] CEO [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] in 1991 to start up the [[restaurant chain]] [[Kenny Rogers Roasters]].  The chicken and [[ribs]] chain, which is similar to [[Boston Market]], was famously featured in an episode of the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' called "[[The Chicken Roaster (Seinfeld episode)|The Chicken Roaster]]". On the November 27, 1997, broadcast of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Rogers could not pick his chicken out in a taste test, claiming he preferred "greasy burgers."{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Rogers and his restaurant were subjects of comedy from ''[[MADtv]]'', especially the impersonation done by [[Will Sasso]]; the sketch of the faux-Rogers hosting ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' became popular on the Internet.

Rogers put his name to the Gambler Chassis Co., a [[Sprint car racing]] manufacturer started by C. K. Spurlock in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. The company used the name from Rogers' hit song ''The Gambler''. During the 1980s/90s, Gambler was one of the fastest and widely used Sprintcars with such drivers as [[Steve Kinser]], [[Sammy Swindell]] and [[Doug Wolfgang]] driving the cars to victory in the [[World of Outlaws]] and the famous [[Knoxville Nationals]]. Gambler sprintcars were also successful in Australia with drivers such as [[Garry Rush]] and [[Steve Brazier]] using Gamblers to win multiple [[Australian Sprintcar Championship]]s. Rush also used a Gambler chassis to win the 1987 World Sprintcar Championship at the [[Claremont Showgrounds|Claremont Speedway]] in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], to date the only time there has been an official [[World Sprintcar Championship]].

Rogers appeared in a 2004 episode of ''[[Reno 911!]]'' as himself being subjected to incompetent security provided by starstruck sheriff's deputies to comical effect.

In October 2012 he released a book ''Luck or Something Like it: A Memoir'' about his ups and downs in his musical career.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Joe|title=Book Review: Luck or Something Like It by Kenny Rogers|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Luck-or-Something-Like-It-by-Kenny-3897706.php|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=September 26, 2012}}</ref> With Mike Blakely, he has written a novel, ''What Are the Chances'', that was released September 1, 2013.

In 2014, Rogers appeared as himself in a [[GEICO]] commercial. singing part of his song "[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]" a capella.
