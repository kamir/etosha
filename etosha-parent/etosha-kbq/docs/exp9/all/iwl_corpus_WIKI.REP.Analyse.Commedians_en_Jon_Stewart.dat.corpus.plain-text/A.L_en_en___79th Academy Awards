===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Tim Goodman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' lamented, "It was long. It was flat. And it was bloated. Worst of all, it was boring." He also wrote that "it was difficult for Ellen's subtle rambling to translate because people want pop and humor and declarative sentences in their Academy Awards. Which they didn't exactly get."<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Tim|title=Departed evening of bloated, boring Hollywood babble|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/THE-79TH-ACADEMY-AWARDS-Departed-evening-of-2646004.php|accessdate=February 6, 2014|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=February 25, 2007}}</ref> ''[[The Denver Post]]'' television critic Joanne Ostrow bemoaned, "Pleasant and innocuous but hardly exciting, DeGeneres forgot the primary Academy Award host directive: It's not about the host. Hollywood's biggest night (and television's second-biggest annual gathering, after the [[Super Bowl]]) is a celebration of film."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne|title=Mediocre Ellen lowers telecast to daytime|url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_5305942|accessdate=February 6, 2014|work=The Denver Post|publisher=MediaNews Group|date=February 26, 2007}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Tom Shales]] gave an average review for DeGeneres but criticized the overall slow and choppy pacing of the program noting that it was "punishingly too long."<ref>{{cite news|last=Shales|first=Tom|title=The Broadcast: Long and Longer|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600027.html|accessdate=February 6, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=February 26, 2007}}</ref>

Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Columnist [[Alessandra Stanley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded DeGeneres's performance writing that she was "cheeky but good-natured, far less barbed and sardonic than [[Jon Stewart]] [[78th Academy Awards|last year]] or [[Chris Rock]] in [[77th Academy Awards|2005]]." She added that her style brought a "casual Friday mood to Fancy Sunday."<ref>{{cite news|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|title=Bringing a Touch of Daytime to Hollywood's Biggest Night|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/26/arts/television/26watc.html?_r=0|accessdate=February 3, 2014|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 25, 2007}}</ref> ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' television critic Gail Pennington praised host DeGeneres and producer Ziskin for turning "the evening into an upbeat celebration&ndash;–and the most entertaining Oscars in years."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pennington|first=Gail|title=DeGeneres kept the Oscar show upbeat and lively|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=February 26, 2007|page=D1}}</ref> Television editor Dave Kronke of the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' gave high marks for DeGeneres commenting, "Her material was amusing but scarcely a laugh riot, yet it was amiable and delineated that the evening was a celebration of all the nominees, not just the winners."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kronke|first=David|title=Yep, She's Funny Gentle Humor wins for DeGeneres|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=MediaNews Group|date=February 26, 2007|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/YEP,+SHE%27S+FUNNY+GENTLE+HUMOR+WINS+FOR+DEGENERES.-a0159975212}}</ref>
