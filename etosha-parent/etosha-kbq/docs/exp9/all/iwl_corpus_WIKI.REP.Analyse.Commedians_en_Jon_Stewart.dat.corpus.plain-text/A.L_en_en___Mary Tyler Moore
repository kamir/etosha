'''Mary Tyler Moore''' (born December 29, 1936) is an American actress, primarily known for her roles in television [[sitcom]]s. Moore is best known for ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' (1970–77), in which she starred as [[Mary Richards]], a 30-something single woman who worked as a local news producer in [[Minneapolis]], and for her earlier role as [[Dick Van Dyke Show#Characters|Laura Petrie]] on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1961–66). She also appeared in a number of films, most notably 1967's ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' and 1980's ''[[Ordinary People]]'', in which she played a role that was very different from the television characters she had portrayed, and for which she was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Moore has been active in charity work and various political causes, particularly the issues of [[animal rights]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 1]]. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes early in the run of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-03-22-mtm-diabetes_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Mary Tyler Moore tells how she took control of diabetes | date=2009-03-25}}</ref> She also dealt with alcoholism, which she wrote about in her first of two memoirs.

==Career==

===Television===

====Early appearances====
Moore decided at age 17 that she wanted to be a dancer. Her television career began with Moore's first job as "Happy Hotpoint", a tiny [[elf]] dancing on [[Hotpoint]] [[home appliance|appliances]] in [[television commercial|TV commercials]] during the 1950s series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet|Ozzie and Harriet]]''.<ref name="AA61-65" /> After appearing in 39 Hotpoint TV commercials in five days, she received approximately $6,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History|last=Weiner|first=Ed|author2=Editors of TV Guide|year=1992|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-096914-8|page=100}}</ref> After becoming pregnant while still working as "Happy", Hotpoint ended her stint when it was too difficult to conceal her pregnancy with the elf costume.<ref name=AA61-65>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=61–65}}</ref> Moore modeled anonymously on the covers of a number of record albums and auditioned for the role of the older daughter of [[Danny Thomas]] for his long-running TV show, but was turned down. Much later, Thomas explained that "no daughter of mine could have that [little] nose."

Moore's first regular television role was as a mysterious and glamorous telephone receptionist on ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''. On the show, Moore's voice was heard, but only her shapely legs appeared on camera, adding to the character's mystique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tyler-moore-dick-36447.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore's Big Break |publisher=Tvguide.com|date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> About this time, she guest-starred on [[John Cassavetes]]'s [[NBC]] detective series ''[[Johnny Staccato]]''.  She also guest-starred in ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' in the episode titled "Bentley and the Big Board".  In 1960, she guest-starred in two episodes, "The O'Mara Ladies" and "All The O'Mara Horses", of the [[William Bendix]]-[[Doug McClure]] NBC [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Overland Trail (TV series)|Overland Trail]]''. Several months later, she appeared in the first episode, entitled "One Blonde Too Many", of NBC's one-season ''[[The Tab Hunter Show]]'', a [[sitcom]] starring the former teen idol as a bachelor cartoonist. In 1961, Moore appeared in several big parts in movies and on television, including ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]'', ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Surfside Six]]'', ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' and ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]''.

====''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' (1961–1966)====

In 1961, [[Carl Reiner]] cast Moore in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', an acclaimed weekly series based on Reiner's own life and career as a writer for [[Sid Caesar]]'s television [[variety show]], telling the cast from the outset that it would run no more than five years. The show was produced by Danny Thomas's company, and Thomas himself recommended her. He remembered Mary as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier.<ref name=paley>[http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=43 Profile] the [[Paley Center for Media]]. Retrieved April 3, 2009.</ref> Moore's energetic comic performances as Van Dyke's character's wife, begun at age 24 (11 years Van Dyke's junior), made both the actress and her signature tight capri pants extremely popular, and she became internationally famous. When she won an [[Emmy]] award for her portrayal of Laura Petrie,<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|p=114}}</ref> she said, "I know this will never happen again." Mary Tyler Moore later stated that she was actually 23 years old when she first starred on the ''Dick Van Dyke Show'',<ref>During an appearance on [[Rachael Ray (TV series)|''The Rachael Ray Show'']].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> but had told producers that she was 25 because she heard that Dick Van Dyke had said she might be too young for the part.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' (1970–1977)====

In 1970, after having appeared earlier in a pivotal one-hour musical special called "Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman", Moore and husband [[Grant Tinker]] successfully pitched a sitcom centered on Moore to [[CBS]]. ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' was a half-hour newsroom sitcom featuring [[Ed Asner]] as her gruff boss [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]], a character that would later be spun off into an hour-long dramatic series. Moore's show proved so popular that two other regular characters, [[Valerie Harper]] as [[Rhoda (TV series)|Rhoda Morgenstern]] and [[Cloris Leachman]] as [[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis Lindstrom]], were also spun off into their own successful series. The premise of the single working woman's life, alternating during the program between work and home, became a television staple.<ref name=paley/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9413674|title=Mary Tyler Moore Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> After six years of ratings in the top 20,<ref name=museum>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/marytylermo/marytylermo.htm "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"] museum.tv. Retrieved April 3, 2009.</ref> the show slipped to number 39 during season seven. Producers argued for its cancellation because of its falling ratings, afraid that the show's legacy might be damaged if it were renewed for another season. To the surprise of the entire cast including Mary Tyler Moore herself, it was announced that they would soon be filming their final episode. After the announcement, the series finished strongly and the final show was the seventh most watched show during the week it aired. The 1977 season would go on to win an ''[[Emmy Award]]'' for Outstanding Comedy Series,<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/mary-tyler-moore Mary Tyler Moore Emmy Winner]</ref> to add to the awards it had won in 1975 and 1976. All in all, during its seven seasons, the program held the record for winning the most Emmys – 29. That record remained unbroken until 2002 when the ''[[NBC]]'' sitcom  ''[[Frasier]]'' won its 30th Emmy. ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' had become a touchpoint of the [[Women's Movement]] because it was one of the first to show, in a serious way, an independent working woman.

====Later projects====

During season six of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', she made a musical/variety special for CBS, titled ''Mary's Incredible Dream'',<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=190–192}}</ref> which featured [[Ben Vereen]]. In 1978, Moore made a second CBS special, ''How to Survive the 70's and Maybe Even Bump Into Happiness''. This time, she received significant support from a strong lineup of guest stars: [[Bill Bixby]], [[John Ritter]], [[Harvey Korman]] and Dick Van Dyke.  In the 1978–79 season, Moore attempted to try the musical-variety genre by starring in two unsuccessful CBS variety series in a row: ''[[Mary (1978 TV series)|Mary]]'', which featured [[David Letterman]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]] and [[Dick Shawn]] in the supporting cast. CBS canceled the series. In March, 1979, the network brought Moore back in a new, retooled show, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Hour]]'' which was described as a "sitvar" (part situation comedy/part variety series) with Moore portraying a TV star putting on a variety show.<ref name=museum/> Michael Keaton was the only cast member of ''Mary'' who remained with Moore as a supporting regular in this revised format. Dick Van Dyke appeared as her guest for one episode. The program was canceled within three months.

In the 1985–86 season, she returned to CBS in a series titled ''[[Mary (1985 TV series)|Mary]]'', which suffered from poor reviews, sagging ratings, and internal strife within the production crew. According to Moore, she asked CBS to pull the show, as she was unhappy with the direction of the program and the producers.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=266–267}}</ref> She also starred in the short-lived ''[[Annie McGuire (TV series)|Annie McGuire]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=271–272}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, she had a cameo and a guest-starring role as herself on two episodes of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. She subsequently also guest-starred on [[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s next TV show, ''[[The Ellen Show]]'', in 2001. In 2004, Moore reunited with her ''Dick Van Dyke Show'' castmates for a reunion "episode" called ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ken Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,634109,00.html|title=Review:The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited|publisher=Ew.com|date=2004-05-14|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

In August 2005, Moore guest-starred as Christine St. George, a high-strung host of a fictional TV show on three episodes of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. Moore's scenes were shot on the same soundstage where ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' was filmed in the 1970s. Moore made a guest appearance on the season 2 premiere of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', which stars her old co-star [[Betty White]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Mary-Tyler-Moore-1024989.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore to Guest-Star on Hot in Cleveland Season Premiere|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}</ref> This marked the first time that White and Moore had worked together since ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' ended in 1977.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/tv/index.ssf/2010/11/mary_tyler_moore_to_guest_star.html "Mary Tyler Moore to guest star on 'Hot in Cleveland'"], November 1, 2010</ref> In the fall of 2013, Moore reprised her role on ''Hot in Cleveland'' in a season four episode which not only reunited Moore and White, but former MTM cast members [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Valerie Harper]] and [[Georgia Engel]] as well. This reunion coincided with Valerie Harper's public announcement that she had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was given only a few months to live.

===Theatre===
Moore appeared in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays. She starred in ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway]]'' with [[James Naughton]], which opened on Broadway at the [[Royale Theatre]] on February 24, 1980, and ran for 96 performances, and in ''[[Sweet Sue (play)|Sweet Sue]]'', which opened at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on January 8, 1987, later transferred to the Royale Theatre, and ran for 164 performances. She was the star of a new musical version of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' in December 1966, but the show, titled ''Holly Golightly'', was a notorious flop that closed in previews before opening on Broadway. In reviews of performances in Philadelphia and Boston, critics "murdered" the play in which Moore claimed to be singing with bronchial pneumonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UGAaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5CcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5182,1978228&dq=holly-golightly+mary-tyler-moore&hl=en |title=Boston and Philadelphia Critics Broke Mary Tyler Moore's Heart |publisher=News.google.com |date=1966-12-04 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

[[File:Mary Tyler Moore 1988.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Moore at the [[Academy Awards]] in 1988]]

Moore appeared in previews of the [[Neil Simon]] play ''[[Rose's Dilemma]]'' at the off-Broadway [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] in December 2003, but quit the production after receiving a critical letter from Simon instructing her to "learn your lines or get out of my play".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|url=http://nymag.com/nymag/columns/culturebusiness/n_9651|title=Comedy of Manners|publisher=Nymag.com|date=2003-12-22|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> Moore had been using an earpiece on stage to feed her lines to the repeatedly rewritten play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83370-Dust-Settled-Neil-Simons-Roses-Dilemma-Opens-Dec-18-Off-Broadway|title=Dust Settled, Neil Simon's Rose's Dilemma Opens Dec. 18 Off-Broadway|publisher=Playbill.com|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

During the 1980s, Moore and her production company produced five plays: ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[The Octette Bridge Club]]'', ''[[A Day in the Death of Joe Egg|Joe Egg]]'', ''[[Benefactors (play)|Benefactors]]'', and ''Safe Sex''.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=23123 "Mary Tyler Moore"] on the [[Internet Broadway Database]]</ref>

===Films===
Moore made her film debut in 1961's ''[[X-15 (film)|X-15]]''. She subsequently appeared in a string of 1960s films (after signing an exclusive contract with [[Universal Pictures]]), including 1967's ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' with [[Julie Andrews]] and 1968's ''[[What's So Bad About Feeling Good?]]'' with [[George Peppard]], and ''Don't Just Stand There!''.

In 1969, she starred opposite [[Elvis Presley]] as a nun in ''[[Change of Habit]]''. Moore's future television castmate [[Ed Asner]] also appeared in that film (as a cop). After that film's disappointing reviews and reception at the box office, Moore returned to television, and did not appear in another feature film for eleven years. She was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for 1980's ''[[Ordinary People]]''. Other feature film credits include ''[[Just Between Friends]]'' and ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]''.

She has appeared in a number of [[television movie]]s, including ''Like Mother, Like Son'', ''[[Run a Crooked Mile]]'', ''[[Heartsounds]]'', ''The Gin Game'' (based on the Broadway play; reuniting her with Dick Van Dyke), ''[[Mary and Rhoda]]'', ''[[Finnegan Begin Again]]'', and ''Stolen Babies'' for which she won an [[Emmy Award]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|page=1443}}</ref>

===Author===
Moore has written two memoirs. The first, ''After All'', released in 1995, in which she acknowledged that she is a recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=278–289}}</ref> The next, ''Growing Up Again: Life, Loves, and Oh Yeah, Diabetes'', was released on April 1, 2009, and focuses on living with [[type 1 diabetes]] ([[St. Martin's Press]]; ISBN 0-312-37631-6).<ref>Sessums, Kevin.

===MTM Enterprises===

{{Main|MTM Enterprises}}
Moore and her husband [[Grant Tinker]] founded [[MTM Enterprises]], Inc. in 1969; Moore later commented that he had named the entity after her in much the same fashion that someone might name a boat after a spouse. This company produced ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and several other television shows and films. It also included a [[record label]], [[MTM Records]].<ref name="kingsbury">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|last=Kingsbury|first=Paul|year=2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|isbn=9780195176087|page=359|url=http://books.google.com/?id=v4GQDYx_RnkC&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=%22MTM+records%22+mary&q=%22MTM%20records%22%20mary|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> MTM Enterprises produced a variety of American sitcoms and drama television series such as ''[[Rhoda]]'',  ''[[Lou Grant]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' &ndash; all spin-offs from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' &ndash; ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', ''[[The Texas Wheelers]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The White Shadow]]'', ''[[Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers|Friends and Lovers]]'', ''[[St Elsewhere]]'' and ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', and was later sold to [[Television South]], an [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] Franchise holder during the 1980s. The MTM logo was a short video sequence parodying the MGM logo, but with a kitten meowing instead of a lion roaring.

In 1955, at age 18, she married Richard Carleton Meeker<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=55–65}}</ref> whom Mary described as "the boy next door," and within six weeks she was pregnant with her only child, Richard, Jr. (born July 3, 1956).

In honor of her father, George Tyler Moore, a lifelong [[American Civil War]] enthusiast, in 1995 Moore donated funds to acquire a historic structure in [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]], for Shepherd College (now [[Shepherd University]]) to be used as a center for Civil War studies. The center, named the [[George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War]] is housed in the historic [[Conrad Shindler House]] (c. 1795), which is named in honor of her great-great-great-grandfather, who owned the structure from 1815–52.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherd.edu/gtmcweb/about_history.html|title=The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War|publisher=Shepherd.edu|date=1993-11-16|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> Moore also contributed to the renovation of the house used as headquarters during 1861–62 by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[Thomas J.

[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of the O'Reilly Factor, has previously stated that Moore had been a viewer of his show and her political views had leaned Conservative in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaPazCt0pOc |title=Actor Ed Asner Talks About New Movie, President Obama, and Socialism |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> In a ''Parade'' magazine article from March 22, 2009, Moore identified herself as a "libertarian centrist" who watches [[Fox News]]. She stated, "...when one looks at what's happened to television, there are so few shows that interest me. I do watch a lot of Fox News.
