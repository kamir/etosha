The '''Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear''' was a gathering that took place on October 30, 2010 at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. The rally was led by [[Jon Stewart]], host of the satirical news program ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Stephen Colbert (character)|in-character]] as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|political pundit]].<ref name=torontosun>{{cite news|title=200K turn out to 'Restore Sanity' in Washington|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=October 30, 2010|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/10/30/15890551.html}}</ref> About 215,000 people attended the rally, according to [[aerial photography]] analysis by AirPhotosLive.com for ''[[CBS News]]''.<ref name=cbs-size>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021284-503544.html|work=CBS News|title=Jon Stewart Rally Attracts Estimated 215,000|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=October 30, 2010}}</ref>

The rally was a combination of what initially were announced as separate events: Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity" and Colbert's counterpart, the "March to Keep Fear Alive." Its stated purpose was to provide a venue for attendees to be heard above what Stewart described as the more vocal and extreme 15–20% of Americans who "control the conversation" of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]],<ref name=AFP>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gkOsOs61eFqq5znyHyVThYNAGTDw|title=US comics unveil dueling DC political rallies|date=September 17, 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref> the argument being that these extremes demonize each other and engage in counterproductive actions, with a return to sanity intended to promote reasoned discussion.  Despite Stewart's insistence to the contrary, news reports cast the rally as a spoof of [[Glenn Beck]]'s [[Restoring Honor rally]] and [[Al Sharpton]]'s [[Reclaim the Dream commemorative march|Reclaim the Dream]] rally.<ref name=NBC/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/51942/212962|title=Jon Stewart: Rallies Not a Response to Glenn Beck|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Origins==

===Response to Restoring Honor rally===
On August 28, 2010, the [[Fox News]] Channel's Glenn Beck held a "Restoring Honor" rally at the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. On the same day, [[Al Sharpton]] led a countermarch, called [[Reclaim the Dream commemorative march|Reclaim the Dream]], to mark the 47th anniversary of the historic [[Great March on Washington]].<ref name=NBC/> According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', discussion for a satirical public event in response took place behind the scenes at Stewart's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as early as August 12.<ref>{{Cite episode|title="August 12, 2010"|url=|series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink=|credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station=|city=|airdate=August 12, 2010|began=|ended=|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|transcript=|transcripturl=|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/68086/index1.html|title=America Is a Joke|author=Chris Smith|date=September 12, 2011|work=[[New York Magazine]]|publisher=New York Media LLC.|pages=2, 5|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> Stewart has stated that the rally was never intended to be a means to counter Glenn Beck, but was simply another format for his and Colbert's style of humor, saying "We saw [the Restoring Honor rally] and thought, 'What a beautiful outline. What a beautiful structure to fill with what we want to express in live form, festival form.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130321994|title=Jon Stewart: The Most Trusted Name In Fake News|author=|date=October 4, 2010|work=[[National Public Radio]]|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref> Before any public discussion by Stewart, Colbert, or their staffs, members of the [[social news]] website [[Reddit]] independently began to discuss the possibility of a Colbert-led rally, often referred to as a "Restoring [[Truthiness]] Rally";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=150942998258775|title=100,000 Strong to Restore Truthiness to the US Capital|publisher=Facebook|date=|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> after the rallies were announced, some news articles credited Reddit for the idea.<ref name=washingtonpost1>{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Melissa|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2010/09/rally_to_restore_sanity_to_mee.html|title=Blog Post - 'Rally to Restore Sanity' to meet 'March to Keep Fear Alive;' Reddit users talk about starting the online campaign|publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2010}}</ref> The rally was produced by Stewart's Busboy Productions.

===Announcement===
[[File:Colbert-Stewart 2010 DC rally posters.png|thumb|left|Early posters for the then-separate rallies]]
Stewart first hinted at the event on the September 7 episode of ''The Daily Show'' by declaring that "[he would] have an announcement sometime in the near to not so near future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-7-2010/moment-of-zen---jon-s-important-announcement |title=Moment of Zen - Jon's Important Announcement - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 09/07/10 - Video Clip &#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> Colbert, in that night's episode of ''The Report,'' said that he, too, had an announcement to make.  In the following days, Stewart and Colbert used their shows to hype their respective announcements, competing over whose would be more significant.  The banter finally culminated with Stewart formally announcing the "Rally to Restore Sanity" on the September 16, 2010 episode of ''The Daily Show'';<ref>{{Cite episode|title="September 16, 2010"|url=|series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink=|credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station=|city=|airdate=September 16, 2010|began=|ended=|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|transcript=|transcripturl=|quote=}}</ref> Colbert followed by announcing the "March to Keep Fear Alive" on the subsequent episode of ''The Colbert Report.''

Stewart declared that his rally was intended for the majority of Americans, "the 70–80 percenters," who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media. To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: "Take it down a notch for America." A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the ''Daily Show'' featuring messages such as "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own "March to Keep Fear Alive." Noting that this was not the time to be reasonable, Colbert declared, "Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,2019855,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Quotes of the Day|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

[[Oprah Winfrey]] appeared on ''The Daily Show'' via video on October 14, 2010, to award the attending audience free airfare to the rally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-october-14-2010/rally-to-restore-sanity-and-or-fear-announcement|title=Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear Announcement|publisher=Comedy Central|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> The plane tickets were hidden under the audience members' seats in the same fashion as she has given away prizes to her own audience members on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021261-503544.html|date=October 30, 2010|title=Jon Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity:" A "Non-Political" Rally That Is Actually Politically Charged|first=Christine|last=Delargy|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> In the episode of the ''Colbert Report'' airing immediately afterward, Stephen Colbert also offered tickets to his rally. Without Oprah's support to provide airfare, Colbert instead distributed vouchers for the low-cost [[Chinatown bus]] from [[New York]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] During the show, Colbert also revealed to Stewart that he did not possess a permit to legally organize the "March to Keep Fear Alive," leading Stewart to propose combining the two events into the "Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" that would feature a new combined logo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/15/oprah-latest-star-lend-celebrity-stewarts-rally/|title=Oprah Latest Star to Lend Celebrity Endorsement to Stewart's Rally|date=October 15, 2010|work=FoxNews.com|publisher=[[FOX News Network]], LLC|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

===Charity drive===
Prior to the announcement of the joint rally, supporters of the movement for a Colbert-led march had begun a [[fundraising|drive]] to raise money for educational charities through [[DonorsChoose]].org, a [[charitable organization]] of which Colbert is a member of the Board of Directors. In the first 24 hours, supporters raised over $100,000. In the days that followed, that total increased to over $250,000,<ref name=washingtonpost1/> and by the day of the rally over $500,000 had been contributed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Restoring Truthiness Giving Page|publisher=DonorsChoose.org|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/truthiness}}</ref> Jon Stewart promoted the [http://www.nationalmall.org Trust for the National Mall], urging his viewers to make donations on behalf of the rally.

===Setting===
As the number of expected participants grew, the rally was moved from the grounds of the Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was on the east side of the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.

Portable toilets and first aid stations were also provided. Because the rally was held the day before the previously scheduled [[Marine Corps Marathon]], the rally planners originally requested to share the portable toilets planned for the marathon runners. The marathon organizers refused, so a second set of portable toilets was ordered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/stewart-colbert-rallies-looking-for-a-few-good-porta-potties/19664942?a_dgi=aolshare_facebook|title=Stewart, Colbert Rallies Looking for a Few Good Porta-Potties|date=October 7, 2010|work=AOL News|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref>

While both Colbert and Stewart were tight-lipped as to the event's schedule and guests, [[Metromix]]'s Washington DC website published a tentative schedule on October 27, with guest performers said to be confirmed for the event including musicians [[Sheryl Crow]], [[The Roots]] and [[Jeff Tweedy]] with [[Mavis Staples]] along with actors [[Don Novello]] (appearing as [[Father Guido Sarducci]]) and [[Sam Waterston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dc.metromix.com/events/article/rally-to-restore-sanity/2268575/content|title="Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" Schedule|publisher=Metromix|date=October 27, 2010|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}</ref> Other guests included [[4troops]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/jon-stewart-opens-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-andor-fear-video.php|title=Jon Stewart Opens The Rally To Restore Sanity And/Or Fear (VIDEO)|publisher=TPM|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> Yusuf Islam - formerly known as [[Cat Stevens]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[The O'Jays]],<ref name=train>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/compost/2010/10/peace_trains_crazy_trains_love.html|title=Peace Trains, Crazy Trains, Love Trains and automobiles at Stewart rally|first=Alexandra|last=Petri|work=Washington Post|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> [[John Legend]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Tony Bennett]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/10/30/2010-10-30_thousands_of_new_yorkers_drawn_to_stephen_colbert_jon_stewart_rally_to_restore_s.html|title=Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear' draws thousands of New Yorkers|publisher=[[Nydailynews.com]] |date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Mythbusters]]'' hosts [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130952931|title='Sanity/Fear' Rally A Protest of the Absurd|publisher=[[NPR]] |date=|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref> basketball player [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Douglas|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8100978/Thousands-attend-Rally-to-Restore-Sanity-in-Washington.html|title=Thousands attend 'Rally to Restore Sanity' in Washington|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2011|location=London}}</ref> and [[R2-D2]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/5-funniest-moments-of-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-and-or-fear/65448/|title=5 Funniest Moments of the 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear'|first=Nicole|last=Allan|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

===Comedy===
Satirical comedy was woven throughout the rally with Colbert expressing, in parody, that fear was superior to Stewart's reasonableness. The theme started with Colbert—costumed like [[Evel Knievel]]—emerging from his "fear bunker" in a capsule reminiscent of the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident#Rescue|2010 Chilean miners' rescue]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=20101108_218_A11_TheWas66103|title=Rallying with revelry, goofiness|first=Robert|last=Evatt|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref> Thereafter, Colbert challenged Stewart point by point, usually claiming victory.

One of their battles centered around songs about trains. Stewart started with [[Yusuf Islam]] singing "[[Peace Train]]," which was interrupted continually by Colbert-backed [[Ozzy Osbourne]] singing "[[Crazy Train]]." The audience held up [[V sign#Vietnam War, victory and peace|peace signs]] for "Peace Train" and [[Sign of the horns|horn signs]] for "Crazy Train." Finally, Stewart and Colbert compromised singing "[[Love Train]]" with [[The O'Jays]].<ref name=train/>

Later, Stewart and Colbert donned matching American flag coats and sang an original song "The Greatest, Strongest Country in the World" with lyrics that reflected common liberal and conservative stereotypes, such as "I love [[NASCAR]] halftime shows with tons of TNT. ... My [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] electric scooter does 100 [[Miles per gallon|m-p-g]]. From gay men who like football ... to straight men who like ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''..."<ref name=nbc-ny>{{cite web|last=Hester|first=Jere|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/television/Boldly-Pushing-the-Bounds-of-Sanity-Fear--and-Comedy-106403678.html|publisher=[[NBC New York]]|title=Boldly Pushing the Bounds of Sanity, Fear&nbsp;– and Comedy|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref>

In the finale, a giant [[papier-mâché]] puppet of Colbert ("Fearzilla") was brought on stage to symbolize his superiority. [[Peter Pan]]—played by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]—then appeared and led the crowd in a chant that caused Colbert and his puppet to melt into the stage, thereby handing final victory to Stewart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesdelphic.com/2010/11/04/rally-to-restore-sanity|title=Rally to Restore Sanity|first=Heather|last=Hall|date=November 4, 2010|work=The Times-Delphic|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

===Medals===
Stewart gave out "Medals of Reasonableness" cast in bronze with an image of an owl and the [[Latin language|Latin]] motto ''Sit vis nobiscum,'' liberally translated by Stewart as "[[May the Force be with you]]," to:
* [[Armando Galarraga]] for his calm response to the [[Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game|blown call that cost him a perfect game]].

==="A Moment of Sincerity" speech===
After defeating Colbert's "Fearzilla", Stewart closed the rally with a "moment... for some sincerity" to explain his intentions for the rally:<ref name=crave>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/132858-metal-meets-folk-meets-soul-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity|title=Metal Meets Folk Meets Soul at The Rally To Restore Sanity: The Roots, Ozzy, Cat Stevens, Kid Rock and more joined Jon Stewart & Stephen Colbert Saturday in D.C. in a show of sanity|first=Johnny|last=Firecloud|work=Crave Online|publisher=CRAVEONLINE MEDIA, LLC|date=October 31, 2010|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

He criticized the role the press plays in polarizing political debates, stating that the media—which he described as "the country’s [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour politico–pundit]] perpetual panic 'conflict-inator'"—only amplifies problems and no longer makes a distinction between "hav[ing] animus" and "be[ing] enemies." He warned that demonizing opponents and accepting propaganda makes people "less safe, not more" and that "it is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racists themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate."<ref name=crave/>

Much of the speech was devoted to the idea that "[m]ost Americans don’t live their lives solely as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]." He spoke on the subject of "reasonable compromises" that happen "every day" between persons of different beliefs, citing as an example traffic merging at the entrance to the [[Holland Tunnel]] connecting [[New York City]] and [[Jersey City]].<ref name=crave/>

==Response to rally==
[[Keith Olbermann]] was prominently featured in a video montage shown at the rally that focused on the anger present in cable news. Two days after the rally, he decided to suspend his "Worst Person in the World" segment on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' in the interest of turning down the volume and anger. However, he defended the content of his show by claiming that [[MSNBC]] (the network that hosted ''Countdown'' at the time) differs from [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] in that "sticking up for the powerless is not the moral equivalent of sticking up for the powerful."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/11/02/2010-11-02_keith_olbermann_drops_worst_person_in_the_world_segment_on_msnbc_after_jon_stewa.html|title=Keith Olbermann drops 'Worst Persons in the World' segment on MSNBC after Jon Stewart rally|first=Aliyah|last=Shahid|work=New York Daily News|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}</ref> After tallying an online vote among his viewers, Olbermann announced that the segment would return on the November 17 broadcast as the "Not Really Worst Persons in the World."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/keith-olbermanns-worst-persons-suspension-returning-according-to-his-twitter-it-is_b40332|title=Keith Olbermann’s ‘Worst Person’ Suspension Over?

On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]],'' [[Bill Maher]] criticized the rally, saying that while Stewart and Colbert meant well, the message of the rally promoted a false equivalency between the left and the right, noting, "the big mistake of modern media has been this notion of balance for balance's sake. That the Left is just as violent and cruel as the Right...there's a difference between a mad man and a madman."<ref>{{cite episode|title=November 5, 2010|series=Real Time with Bill Maher|credits=Bill Maher|network=HBO|airdate=November 5, 2010|season=8|number=24}}</ref>

On November 11, Stewart appeared on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' and clarified the message he intended to convey at the rally: that too many have "bought into the idea that the conflict [in America] is left versus right" when the conflict is actually "corruption versus not-corruption" and that "both sides have their ways of shutting down debate."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/11/11/jon-stewart-on-the-rachel-maddow-show-we-have-a-special-place-in-our-hearts-for-fox/|title=Jon Stewart on the Rachel Maddow Show: "We Have a Special Place In Our Hearts For Fox|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>

In the weeks after the rally, the controversy from 20 years earlier over [[Cat Stevens' comments about Salman Rushdie]] was re-ignited, as commentators debated the decision to invite Cat Stevens/Yusuf to perform at the rally. [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] of ''Politico'' said that some found Stevens' appearance at the rally to be a "dissonant note". Professor [[Akbar Ahmed]] said the debate was yet another example of "controversies being dug up and taken out of context to be aired simply because of a rather poisonous environment around Islam."<ref name="TBD1">[http://www.tbd.com/articles/2010/11/should-jon-stewart-have-booked-cat-stevens-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity--32297.html Should Jon Stewart have booked Cat Stevens at the Rally to Restore Sanity?]; ABC 7 News - TBD.com; Ali M. Latifi; November 18, 2010</ref>  [[Salman Rushdie]] called Stewart after the rally to speak with him about Yusuf's appearance, but said Stewart "said he was sorry it upset me, but really, it was plain that he was fine with it. Depressing." Stewart gave his perspective two years later.  Stewart, saying that he didn’t know about Yusuf’s comments at the time, explained: "I’m sure he doesn’t believe that people should be put to death for apostasy. I said, ‘look, I’m sorry you’re upset, but I’m sure the guy isn’t really like that. Let me talk to him.'" Yusuf characterized the 1989 episode as a "misunderstanding", but added, "although why do you have to insult the Prophet?" Stewart continued, "We get into a whole conversation, and it becomes very clear to me that he is straddling two worlds in a very difficult way. And that he actually still – and it broke my heart a little bit. ... If I had known that, I wouldn’t have done it. Because that to me is a deal breaker. Death for free speech is a deal breaker."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.third-beat.com/2012/12/10/jon-stewart-almost-quit-daily-show-asshole-coworkers-and-secrets-revealed-conversation-stephen-colbert/|date=December 10, 2012|title=Jon Stewart to Stephen Colbert: I almost quit Daily Show over "asshole" coworkers|first=Sharilyn|last=Johnson|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref> In 2014, as he had in 2010,<ref>[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/sean-hannity-and-panel-rail-on-the-rally-to-restore-cat-stevensyusuf-islam/ Sean Hannity And Panel Rail On The ‘Rally To Restore Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam’]; [[Mediaite]]; Colby hall; November 1, 2010</ref> conservative talk show host [[Sean Hannity]] criticized Jon Stewart for inviting Yusuf.
