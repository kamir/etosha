==Overview==
British comedians [[Richard Herring]] and [[Jo Caulfield]] wrote in an article that observational comedy "essentially involves saying 'Did you ever notice?' and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home."<ref name="Herring Caulfield">{{cite news|last1=Herring|first1=Richard|last2=Caulfield|first2=Jo|authorlink1=Richard Herring|authorlink2=Jo Caulfield|title=The comedian's toolbox|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/22/comedy4|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 September 2008}}</ref> [[Eddie Izzard]] noted that a comedian's observations "need to be something that people can relate to, for the audience to pick up on it" in order to be considered a successful observational comedy act.<ref name="Double"/> [[Douglas Coupland]] writes, "Anybody can describe a pre-[[Wet wipe|moistened towelette]] to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly is the 'deal' with them." He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a "lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable-those banalities and fragments of minutae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units."<ref>{{cite book|last=Grassian|first=Daniel|title=Hybrid Fictions: American Literature and Generation X|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=London|isbn=978-0786416325|page=182}}</ref>

==History==
Observational comedy became popular in the United States in the 1950s.<ref name="Double"/> Although one author suggests that it "has never been particularly new. Even the more 'old-fashioned' jokes it supposedly replaced were often themselves disguised commentaries based on observing human nature."<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=John|authorlink=John Byrne (columnist)|title=Writing Comedy|date=2012|publisher=Methuen Drama|location=London|isbn=978-1408146453|page=10|edition=4th}}</ref> [[Shelley Berman]] was one of the pioneers in the field.<ref name="Double"/> [[David Brenner]]'s "brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups",<ref>{{cite news|last=Elber|first=Lynn|title=Comedian David Brenner, 'Tonight' favorite, dies|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/comedian-david-brenner-tonight-favorite-dies|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=16 March 2014|quote=...whose brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups, including Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Platt|first=Larry|title=David Brenner will perform at the Sellersville Theater|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-06-15/entertainment/29660728_1_david-brenner-wash-larry-platt|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|date=15 June 2011|quote=Brenner gave birth to a generation of "observational" comics - funny men who examined small moments closely and poked fun at life's minutiae.

==Criticism of the term==
[[Richard Zoglin]] considers the term "observational comedy" misleading because it is not "about politics or social issues or the comedian's own autobiography, but simply about everyday life."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zoglin|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Zoglin|title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America|date=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1582346250}}</ref>
