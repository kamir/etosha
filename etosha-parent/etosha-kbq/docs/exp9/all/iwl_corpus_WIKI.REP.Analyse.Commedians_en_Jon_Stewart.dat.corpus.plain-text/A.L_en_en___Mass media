The '''mass media''' are diversified [[media (communication)|media]] [[technology|technologies]] that are intended to reach a large audience by [[mass communication]]. The technologies through which this communication takes place varies. Broadcast media such as [[radio]], recorded music, [[film]] and [[television]] transmit their information electronically. Print media use a physical object such as a [[newspaper]], [[book]], [[pamphlet]] or [[comics]],<ref>Riesman ''et al.'' (1950) ch.2 p.50</ref> to distribute their information. Outdoor media are a form of mass media that comprises [[billboard]]s, signs, or placards placed inside and outside of commercial buildings, sports stadiums, shops, and buses. Other outdoor media include flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), [[blimp]]s, [[skywriting]],<ref name="Mass Media"/>  and [[Augmented Reality|AR Advertising]]. Public speaking and event organising can also be considered forms of mass media.<ref name="buzzle" /> The digital media comprises both Internet and [[mobile web|mobile]] mass communication. [[Internet]] media provide many mass media services, such as [[email]], [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, and Internet-based radio and television. Many other mass media outlets have a presence on the web, by such things as having TV ads that link to a website, or distributing a [[QR Code]] in print or outdoor media to direct a mobile user to a website. In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility that the Internet has, and the outreach that Internet affords, as information can easily be broadcast to many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently.

The organizations that control these technologies, such as television stations or publishing companies, are also known as the mass media.<ref name="dictionary"/><ref name="Arguing for a general framework for mass media scholarship"/>{{qn|date=September 2012}}

== Issues with definition ==

In the late 20th Century, mass media could be classified{{by whom|date=January 2012}} into eight mass media industries: books, newspapers, magazines, recordings, radio, movies, television and the internet.  With the explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the question of what forms of media should be classified as "mass media" has become more prominent.  For example, it is controversial whether to include cell phones, video games, and computer games (such as MMORPGs) in the definition.  In the 2000s, a classification called the "[[seven mass media]]" became popular.  In order of introduction, they are:

# [[Printing|Print]] ([[book]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, etc.) from the late 15th century
# [[Recording]]s ([[gramophone record]]s, [[magnetic tape]]s, [[compact Cassette|cassette]]s, [[Stereo-Pak|cartridge]]s, [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s) from the late 19th century
# [[Film|Cinema]] from about 1900
# [[Radio broadcasting|Radio]] from about 1910
# [[Television]] from about 1950
# [[Internet]] from about 1990
# [[Mobile phone]]s from about 2000

Each mass media has its own content types, its own creative artists and technicians, and its own business models.  For example, the Internet includes [[web site]]s, [[blog]]s, [[podcasts]], and various other technologies built on top of the general distribution network.  The sixth and seventh media, internet and mobile, are often called collectively as [[digital media]]; and the fourth and fifth, radio and TV, as [[broadcast media]].  Some argue that [[video games]] have developed into a distinct mass form of media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541164 |title=All the world’s a game |publisher=The Economist |date=2011-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref>

While a telephone is a two-way communication device, mass media refer to medium which can communicate a message to a large group, often simultaneously. However, modern cell phones are no longer a single-use device. Most cell phones are equipped with internet access and capable of connecting to the web which itself is a mass medium. A question arises whether this makes cell phones a mass medium or simply a device used to access a mass medium (the internet). There is currently a system by which marketers and advertisers are able to tap into satellites, and broadcast commercials and advertisements directly to cell phones, unsolicited by the phone's user.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} This transmission of mass advertising to millions of people is a form of mass communication.

Video games may also be evolving into a mass medium. Video games convey the same messages and ideologies to all their users. Users sometimes share the experience with one another by playing online. Excluding the internet however,  it is questionable whether players of video games are sharing a common experience when they play the game separately. It is possible to discuss in great detail the events of a video game with a friend you have never played with because the experience was identical to you both. The question is whether this is then a form of mass communication.

Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as Runescape provide a common gaming experience to millions of users across the globe. It is arguable that the users are receiving the same message, i.e., the game is mass communicating the same messages to the various players.

=== Characteristics ===

Five characteristics of mass communication have been identified by [[Cambridge University]]'s [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]]:<ref name="thompson">Thompson: [http://books.google.com/books?id=iXHzjIwQae4C ''The Media and Modernity''] pp.26-8, 74</ref>

* "[C]omprises both technical and institutional methods of production and distribution" This is evident throughout the history of the media, from print to the Internet, each suitable for commercial utility.
* Involves the "commodification of symbolic forms",  as the production of materials relies on its ability to manufacture and sell large quantities of the work. Just as radio stations rely on their time sold to advertisements, so too newspapers rely on their space for the same reasons.
* "[S]eparate contexts between the production and reception of information"
* Its "reach to those 'far removed' in time and space, in comparison to the producers".
* "[I]nformation distribution" - a "one to many" form of communication, whereby products are mass-produced and disseminated to a great quantity of audiences.

=== Mass vs. mainstream ===

The term "mass media" is sometimes used as a synonym for "[[mainstream media]]", which are distinguished from [[alternative media]] by the content and point of view.  Alternative media are also "mass media" outlets in the sense that they use technology capable of reaching many people, even if the audience is often smaller than the mainstream.

In common usage, the term "mass" denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products, but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients.<ref name="thompson"/>

=== Mass vs. local ===

Mass media are distinguished from local media by the notion that whilst the former aims to reach a very large market such as the entire population of a country, the latter broadcasts to a much smaller population and area, and generally focuses on regional news rather than global events. A third type of media, speciality media, provide for specific demographics, such as [[specialty channel]]s on TV ([[sports channel]]s, porn channels, etc.). These definitions are not set in stone, and it is possible for a media outlet to be promoted in status from a local media outlet to a global media outlet. Some local media, which take an interest in state or provincial news, can rise to prominence because of their investigative journalism, and to the local region's preference of updates in national politics rather than regional news. [[The Guardian]], formerly known as the Manchester Guardian is an example of one such media outlet. Once a regional daily newspaper, The Guardian is currently a nationally respected paper.<ref name="wisegeek" />

== Forms of mass media ==

=== Broadcast ===
[[File:Crystal radio advertisement.png|thumb|A family listening to a [[crystal radio]] in the 1920s]]
The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]]. With all technological endeavours a number of technical terms and slang have developed please see the [[list of broadcasting terms]] for a glossary of terms used.

[[Television]] and [[radio]] programs are distributed through radio broadcasting over frequency bands that are highly regulated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the United States. Such regulation includes determination of the width of the bands, range, licencing, types of receivers and transmitters used, and acceptable content.

[[cable television|Cable]] programs are often broadcast simultaneously with radio and television programs, but have a more limited audience. By coding signals and having a [[cable converter box]] in [[home]]s, cable also enables [[subscription]]-based channels and [[pay-per-view]] services.

A broadcasting [[organisation]] may broadcast several programs at the same time, through several channels ([[frequencies]]), for example [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two|Two]]. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day. [[Digital radio]] and [[digital television]] may also transmit [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] programming, with several channels [[data compression|compressed]] into one [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]].

When broadcasting is done via the Internet the term [[webcasting]] is often used. In 2004 a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce [[podcast]]ing. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium, with one of the main proponents being [[Adam Curry]] and his associates the [[Podshow]].

=== Film ===

''''Film'''' encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The name comes from the [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock|filmstock]]), historically the primary [[recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures.  Many other terms exist—''motion pictures'' (or just ''pictures'' and "picture"), ''the silver screen'', ''photoplays'', ''the cinema'', ''picture shows'', ''flicks''—and commonly ''movies''.

Films are produced by [[recording]] people and objects with [[camera]]s or by creating them using [[animation]] techniques and/or [[special effect]]s.  Films comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown in rapid succession, the illusion of motion is given to the viewer.  Flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]]—whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed.  Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion; a psychological effect identified as [[beta movement]].

Film is considered by many {{who|date=March 2015}} to be an important [[art]] form; films entertain, educate, enlighten and inspire audiences. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that translate the film message. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.

=== Video games ===

A [[video game]] is a [[computer]]-controlled game in which a video display such as a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[television]] is the primary feedback device. The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text (and which can therefore theoretically be played on a [[teletypewriter]]) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary feedback device, but there are very few new games in these categories. There always must also be some sort of [[input device]], usually in the form of [[button (control)|button/joystick]] combinations (on arcade games), a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] & [[Computer mouse|mouse]]/[[trackball]] combination (computer games), or a [[Game controller|controller]] ([[Video game console|console]] games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input. Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe.

In common usage, a "computer game" or a "[[personal computer game|PC game]]" refers to a game that is played on a [[personal computer]]. "[[Console game]]" refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such, while interfacing with a standard [[television]] set. "[[Arcade game]]" refers to a game designed to be played in an establishment in which patrons pay to play on a per-use basis.  "Video game" (or "videogame") has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device, including, but not limited to, [[mobile phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], advanced [[calculator]]s, etc.

=== Audio recording and reproduction ===

[[Sound recording and reproduction]] is the [[electric]]al or mechanical re-creation and/or amplification of [[sound]], often as [[music]]. This involves the use of [[audio equipment]] such as microphones, recording devices, and loudspeakers. From early beginnings with the invention of the [[phonograph]] using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording, the mass production of the [[Gramophone record|78 record]], the [[wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]] followed by the [[tape recorder]], the vinyl [[Gramophone record|LP record]]. The invention of the [[compact cassette]] in the 1960s, followed by Sony's [[Walkman]], gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of [[digital recording]] and the [[compact disc]] in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality. The most recent developments have been in [[digital audio player]]s.

An album is a collection of related audio recordings, released together to the public, usually commercially.

The term [[album|record album]] originated from the fact that 78 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] [[Phonograph]] [[Gramophone record|disc records]] were kept together in a book resembling a photo album. The first collection of records to be called an "album" was [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'', release in April 1909 as a four-disc set by [[Odeon records]].<ref name="sandiego"/><ref name="Chronomedia"/> It retailed for 16 [[shillings]]—about [[Pound sterling|£]]15 in modern currency.

A [[music video]] (also promo) is a [[short film]] or [[video]] that accompanies a complete piece of music, most commonly a [[song]]. Modern music videos were primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the origins of music videos go back much further, they came into their own in the 1980s, when [[Music Television]]'s format was based on them. In the 1980s, the term "rock video" was often used to describe this form of entertainment, although the term has fallen into disuse.

Music videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking, including [[animation]], [[live action]] films, [[documentary film|documentaries]], and non-narrative, [[abstract film]].

=== Internet ===
{{see also|Web extra}}

The [[Internet]] (also known simply as "the Net" or less precisely as "the Web") is a more interactive medium of mass media, and can be briefly described as "a network of networks". Specifically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected [[computer network]]s that transmit [[data (computing)|data]] by [[packet switching]] using the standard [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and governmental networks, which together carry various [[information]] and services, such as [[email]], [[online chat]], [[Computer file|file]] transfer, and the interlinked [[web page]]s and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].

Contrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected ''computer networks'', linked by [[copper]] wires, [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] cables, [[wireless]] connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected ''documents'', linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s.  The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, [[file sharing]] and others described below.

Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a [[web site]] has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of [[web traffic]] is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of [[peer-to-peer]] technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable.  Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. "content") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes.  This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society.

"Cross-media" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea is expressed in the news industry as "convergence". Many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both [[printing|print]] and on the web without manual conversion effort. An increasing number of [[wireless]] devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective “create once, publish many”.

The Internet is quickly becoming the center of mass media. Everything is becoming accessible via the internet. Rather than picking up a newspaper, or watching the 10 o'clock news, people can log onto the internet to get the news they want, when they want it. For example, many workers listen to the radio through the Internet while sitting at their desk.

Even the [[education system]] relies on the Internet. Teachers can contact the entire class by sending one e-mail. They may have web pages on which students can get another copy of the class outline or assignments. Some classes have class blogs in which students are required to post weekly, with students graded on their contributions.

==== Blogs (web logs) ====

[[Blogging]], too, has become a pervasive form of media.  A [[blog]] is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or interactive media such as images or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order, with most recent posts shown on top. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images and other graphics, and links to other blogs, web pages, and related media. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. [[Microblogging]] is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.

==== RSS feeds ====

[[RSS]] is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like [[Wired News|Wired]], news-oriented community sites like [[Slashdot]], and personal blogs. It is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines, and podcasts. An RSS document (which is called a "feed" or "web feed" or "channel") contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner that can be piped into special programs or filtered displays.

==== Podcast ====
{{Main|Podcast}}

A [[podcast]] is a series of digital-media files which are distributed over the Internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and computers. The term podcast, like broadcast, can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.

==== Mobile ====

[[Mobile phone]]s were introduced in [[Japan]] in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in Finland. Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and other portable devices, and today the total value of media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content, and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 (source Informa). The mobile media content includes over 8 billion dollars worth of mobile music (ringing tones, ringback tones, truetones, MP3 files, karaoke, music videos, music streaming services etc.); over 5 billion dollars worth of mobile gaming; and various news, entertainment and advertising services. In Japan mobile phone books are so popular that five of the ten best-selling printed books were originally released as mobile phone books.

Similar to the internet, mobile is also an interactive media, but has far wider reach, with 3.3 billion mobile phone users at the end of 2007 to 1.3 billion internet users (source ITU). Like email on the internet, the top application on mobile is also a personal messaging service, but SMS text messaging is used by over 2.4 billion people. Practically all internet services and applications exist or have similar cousins on mobile, from search to multiplayer games to virtual worlds to blogs. Mobile has several unique benefits which many mobile media pundits claim make mobile a more powerful media than either TV or the internet, starting with mobile being permanently carried and always connected. Mobile has the best audience accuracy and is the only mass media with a built-in payment channel available to every user without any credit cards or PayPal accounts or even an age limit. Mobile is often called the [[Seven mass media|7th Mass Medium]] and either the fourth screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens) or the third screen (counting only TV and PC).

=== Print media ===

==== Book ====
{{Main|Book}}
[[File:Brockhaus Lexikon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus]] [[Conversations-Lexikon mit vorzüglicher Rücksicht auf die gegenwärtigen Zeiten|Konversations-Lexikon]], 1902]]

A [[book]] is a collection of sheets of [[paper]], [[parchment]] or other material with a piece of text written on them, bound together along one edge within covers. A book is also a literary work or a main division of such a work. A book produced in electronic format is known as an [[e-book]].

<!-- In [[library and information science]], a book is called a [[monograph]] to distinguish it from serial [[publication]]s such as [[magazine]]s, [[journal]]s or [[newspaper]]s.

Publishers may produce low-cost, pre-proof editions known as [[Galley proof|galleys]] or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.
-->

==== Magazine ====

A [[magazine]] is a periodical [[publication]] containing a variety of articles, generally financed by [[advertising]] and/or purchase by readers.

Magazines are typically published [[week]]ly, [[biweekly]], [[month]]ly, [[bimonthly]] or [[quarterly]], with a [[periodical cover date|date on the cover]] that is in advance of the date it is actually published.  They are often printed in color on coated paper, and are bound with a [[bookbinding|soft cover]].

Magazines fall into two broad categories: consumer magazines and business magazines.  In practice, magazines are a subset of [[:Category:Periodicals|periodicals]], distinct from those periodicals produced by scientific, artistic, academic or special interest publishers which are subscription-only, more expensive, narrowly limited in circulation, and often have little or no advertising.

Magazines can be classified as:
* General interest magazines (e.g. ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'', ''[[India Today]]'', ''[[The Week]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' etc.)
* Special interest magazines (women's, sports, business, [[scuba diving]], etc.)

==== Newspaper ====

A [[newspaper]] is a [[publication]] containing news and information and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called [[newsprint]]. It may be general or special interest, most often published daily or weekly. The first printed newspaper was published in 1605, and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as radio and television. Recent developments on the Internet are posing major threats to its business model, however. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of a newspaper's income, is shifting from print to online; some commentators, nevertheless, point out that historically new media such as radio and television did not entirely supplant existing.

=== Outdoor media ===

Outdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards placed inside and outside of commercial buildings/objects like shops/buses, flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), blimps, skywriting, AR Advertising. Many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums. Tobacco and alcohol manufacturers used billboards and other outdoor media extensively. However, in 1998, the Master Settlement Agreement between the US and the tobacco industries prohibited the billboard advertising of cigarettes. In a 1994 Chicago-based study, Diana Hackbarth and her colleagues revealed how tobacco- and alcohol-based billboards were concentrated in poor neighbourhoods. In other urban centers, alcohol and tobacco billboards were much more concentrated in African-American neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.<ref name="Mass Media"/>

== Purposes ==
[[File:911-Panel.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A panel in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], shows the September 12 headlines in America and around the world]]

Mass media encompasses much more than just news, although it is sometimes misunderstood in this way.  It can be used for various purposes:
* [[Advocacy]], both for business and social concerns. This can include [[advertising]], [[marketing]], [[propaganda]], [[public relations]], and [[politics|political]] communication.
* [[Entertainment]], traditionally through performances of [[acting]], [[music]], [[sports]], and [[TV show]]s along with light reading; since the late 20th century also through [[video and computer games]].
* [[Public service announcement]]s and emergency alerts (that can be used as political device to communicate propaganda to the public).<ref name="wisegeek" />

== Professions involving mass media ==

=== Journalism ===

[[Journalism]] is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting [[information]] regarding [[News|current events]], [[Fads and trends|trends]], issues and [[people]]. Those who practice journalism are known as [[journalist]]s.

[[News]]-oriented journalism is sometimes described as the "first rough draft of history" (attributed to [[Phil Graham]]), because journalists often record important events, producing news articles on short deadlines. While under pressure to be first with their stories, [[news media]] organizations usually [[editing|edit]] and [[proofreading|proofread]] their reports prior to publication, adhering to each organization's standards of accuracy, quality and style. Many news organizations claim proud traditions of holding government officials and institutions accountable to the public, while media critics have raised questions about holding the press itself accountable to the standards of [[Journalism#Professional journalism|professional journalism]].

=== Public relations ===

[[Public relations]] is the art and science of managing communication between an organization and its key publics <!--?-->to build, manage and sustain its positive image. Examples include:
* [[Corporation]]s use marketing public relations to convey information about the products they manufacture or services they provide to potential customers to support their direct sales efforts.  Typically, they support sales in the short and long term, establishing and burnishing the corporation's branding for a strong, ongoing market.
* Corporations also use public relations as a vehicle to reach legislators and other politicians, seeking favorable tax, regulatory, and other treatment, and they may use public relations to portray themselves as enlightened employers, in support of human-resources recruiting programs.
* [[Non-profit organization|Nonprofit organization]]s, including schools and universities, hospitals, and human and social service agencies, use public relations in support of awareness programs, fund-raising programs, staff recruiting, and to increase patronage of their services.
* Politicians use public relations to attract votes and raise money, and, when successful at the ballot box, to promote and defend their service in office, with an eye to the next election or, at career’s end, to their legacy.

=== Publishing ===

[[Publishing]] is the industry concerned with the production of [[literature]] or [[information]] – the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers.

Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as [[book]]s and [[newspaper]]s. With the advent of digital information systems and the [[Internet]], the scope of publishing has expanded to include [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, and the like.

As a [[business]], publishing includes the development, [[marketing]], [[Mass production|production]], and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of newspapers, magazines, books, [[literary work]]s, [[musical composition|musical work]]s, [[software]], other works dealing with information.

Publication is also important as a [[law|legal concept]]; (1) as the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to marry or enter bankruptcy, and; (2) as the essential precondition of being able to claim [[defamation]]; that is, the alleged [[libel]] must have been published.

==== Software publishing ====

A [[software publisher]] is a [[publishing]] [[company (law)|company]] in the [[software industry]] between the [[software developer|developer]] and the [[distribution (business)|distributor]]. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of [[shareware]]).

Software publishers often license software from developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region. The terms of licensing vary enormously, and are typically secret.

Developers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets, or to avoid focussing on marketing. Or publishers may use developers to create software to meet a market need that the publisher has identified.

== History ==
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|180px|Early wooden printing press, depicted in 1520.]]
The history of mass media can be traced back to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures. This was the first time when a form of media was "broadcast" to a wider audience. The first dated printed book known is the "[[Diamond Sutra]]", printed in China in 868&nbsp;AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier. Movable clay type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relatively high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass-medium was probably European [[popular prints]] from about 1400.  Although these were produced in huge numbers, very few early examples survive, and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term "mass media" was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for being the first example of mass media, as we use the term today. This form of media started in Europe in the Middle Ages.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation.  He printed the first book on a [[printing press]] with [[movable type]] in 1453. The Gutenberg Bible, one of the books he published, was translated into many different languages and printed throughout the continent.  The invention of the [[printing press]] in the late 15th century gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication, by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible.<ref name="Radical mass media criticism: a cultural genealogy"/><ref name="ramey-2007-1-2"/><ref name="Sex, love & romance in the mass media: analysis & criticism of unrealistic portrayals & their influence"/> The invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass-medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620;<ref name="www"/> but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass-audience directly. The first high-circulation newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as [[The Times]], and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas. The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one-way medium.<ref name="Encyclopedia of library and information science, Volume 65"/><ref name="A companion to media studies"/><ref name="Mass media & society"/>

The phrase "the media" began to be used in the 1920s.<ref name="Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet"/> The notion of "mass media" was generally restricted to print media up until the post-Second World War, when radio, television and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular, because they provided both information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio than to actively read. In recent times, the Internet become the latest and most popular mass medium. Information has become readily available through websites, and easily accessible through search engines. One can do many activities at the same time, such as playing games, listening to music, and social networking, irrespective of location. Whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer, the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as Google Books. Modern day mass media consists of the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts and RSS feeds.<ref name="History of Mass Media"/>

During the 20th century, the growth of mass media was driven by [[technology]], including that which allowed much duplication of material. Physical duplication technologies such as [[printing]], record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. [[Radio]] and [[television]] allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money. An example of Riel and Neil's theory. [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to be made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the [[Constituency|electorate]] about issues regarding government and corporate entities (see [[Media influence]]). Some consider the [[concentration of media ownership]] to be a threat to democracy.<ref name="incorporated"/>

'''Limited-effects theory''', originally tested in the 1940s and 1950s, considers that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe, media exerts a negligible influence. '''Class-dominant theory''' argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. '''Culturalist theory''', which was developed in the 1980s and 1990s, combines the other two theories and claims that people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive. This theory states that audience members play an active, rather than passive role in relation to mass media.

In an article entitled ''Mass Media Influence on Society'', rayuso {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} argues that the media ''in the US'' is dominated by five major companies (Time Warner, VIACOM, Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp) which own 95% of all mass media including theme parks, movie studios, television and radio broadcast networks and programing, video news, sports entertainment, telecommunications, wireless phones, video games software, electronic media and music companies. Whilst historically, there was more diversity in companies, they have recently merged to form an elite which have the power to shape the opinion and beliefs of people. People buy after seeing thousands of advertisements by various companies in TV, newspapers or magazines, which are able to affect their purchasing decisions. The definition of what is acceptable by society is dictated by the media. This power can be used for good, for example encouraging children to play sport. However, it can also be used for bad, for example children being influenced by cigars smoked by film stars, their exposure to sex images, their exposure to images of violence and their exposure to junk food ads. The documentary [[Supersize Me]] describes how companies like McDonalds have been sued in the past, the plaintiffs claiming that it was the fault of their liminal and subliminal advertising that "forced" them to perchance the product. The Barbie and Ken dolls of the 1950s are sometimes cited as the main cause for the obsession in modern day society for women to be skinny and men to be buff. After the attacks of 9/11, the media gave extensive coverage of the event and exposed Osama Bin Laden's guilt for the attack, information they were told by the authorities. This shaped the public opinion to support the war on terrorism, and later, the war on Iraq. A main concern is that due to this immense power of the mass media (being able to drive the public opinion), media receiving inaccurate information could cause the public opinion to support the wrong cause.

In his book The Commercialization of American Culture, Matthew P. McAllister says that "a well-developed media system, informing and teaching its citizens, helps democracy move toward its ideal state."<ref name="enotes"/>

In 1997, J. R. Finnegan Jr. and K. Viswanath identified 3 main effects or functions of mass media:

:#'''The Knowledge Gap:''' The mass media influences knowledge gaps due to factors including "the extent to which the content is appealing, the degree to which information channels are accessible and desirable, and the amount of social conflict and diversity there is in a community".
:#'''Agenda Setting:''' People are influence in how they think about issues due to the selective nature of what media choose for public consumption. After publicly disclosing that he had prostate cancer prior to the 2000 New York senatorial election, Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York City (aided by the media) sparked a huge priority elevation of the cancer in people's consciousness. This was because news media began to report on the risks of prostate cancer, which in turn prompted a greater public awareness about the disease and the need for screening. This ability for the media to be able to change how the public thinks and behaves has occurred on other occasions. In mid-1970s when Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller, wives of the then-President and then-Vice President respectively, were both diagnosed with breast cancer. J. J. Davis states that "when risks are highlighted in the media, particularly in great detail, the extent of agenda setting is likely to be based on the degree to which a public sense of outrage and threat is provoked". When wanting to set an agenda, framing can be invaluably useful to a mass media organisation. Framing involves "taking a leadership role in the organisation of public discourse about an issue". The media is influenced by the desire for balance in coverage, and the resulting pressures can come from groups with particular political action and advocacy positions. Finnegan and Viswanath say, "groups, institutions, and advocates compete to identify problems, to move them onto the public agenda, and to define the issues symbolically" (1997, p.&nbsp;324).
:#'''Cultivation of Perceptions:''' The extent to which media exposure shapes audience perceptions over time is known as cultivation. Television is a common experience, especially in places like the United States, to the point where it can be described as a "homogenising agent" (S. W. Littlejohn). However, instead of being merely a result of the TV, the effect is often based on socioeconomic factors. Having a prolonged exposure to TV or movie violence might affect a viewer to the extent where they actively think community violence is a problem, or alternatively find it justifiable. The resulting belief is likely to be different depending of where people live however.<ref name="enotes" />

Since the 1950s, when cinema, radio and TV began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population, these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control.<ref name="Lorimer94p26"/><ref name="Vipond2000p88"/> Up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a [[advanced capitalism|high level of industrialization]], the country itself "belongs to the person who controls communications."<ref name="Eco67"/>

Mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information.<ref name="Lorimer94p26"/> They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values, and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation.<ref name="Vipond2000p88"/> Mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations, riots, and general strikes.<ref name="civil">Dan Braha. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048596 “Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction”], PLoS ONE 7(10) (2012): e48596. doi:10.1371/journal.pone .0048596.</ref> That is, the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities, but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks.<ref name="civil"/>

=== Racism and stereotyping ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
{{Main|Stereotype}}
{{Globalize|section|date=March 2015}}
Mass media has played a large role in the way white Americans perceive African-Americans. The media focus on African-American in the contexts of crime, drug use, gang violence, and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of African-Americans. African-Americans have been subjected to oppression and discrimination for the past few hundred years. According to Stephen Balkaran in his article Mass Media and Racism, "The media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to African-Americans' continuing status as second-class citizens". This has resulted in an uncertainty among white Americans as to what the genuine nature of African-Americans really is. Despite the resulting racial divide, the fact that these people are undeniably American has "raised doubts about the white man's value system". This means that there is a somewhat "troubling suspicion" among some Americans that their white America is tainted by the black influence.<ref name="Mass Media and Racism"/> Mass media as well as [[propaganda]] tend to reinforce or introduce [[stereotype]]s to the general public.

The mass media has also been criticized for its racial bias, such as downplaying African-Americans committing crimes and publicizing crimes committed against them by races other than their own. Notable examples are 13-month-old Antonio West's murder being ignored for [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]]'s and Dillon Taylor's for [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]]'s. The media also tends to censor the ethnicity of black perpetrators and not doing the same to those of other races.

== Ethical issues and criticism ==

Lack of local or specific topical focus is a common criticism of mass media.  A mass [[news media]] outlet is often forced to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic. As such, it has to skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers. An example given by the website WiseGeek is that "the residents of a community might view their fight against development as critical, but the story would only attract the attention of the mass media if the fight became controversial or if precedents of some form were set".<ref name="wisegeek" />

The term "mass" suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive, undifferentiated individuals. This is an image associated with some earlier critiques of "mass culture" and [[mass society]] which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life, creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them.<ref name="thompson" />  However, interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media.<ref name="thompson" />

Whilst some{{who|date=January 2012}} refer to the mass media as "opiate of the masses", others{{who|date=January 2012}} argue that is a vital aspect of human societies. By understanding mass media, one is then able to analyse and find a deeper understanding of one's population and culture. This valuable and powerful ability is one reason why the field of [[media studies]] is popular. As WiseGeek says, "watching, reading, and interacting with a nation's mass media can provide clues into how people think, especially if a diverse assortment of mass media sources are perused".<ref name="wisegeek" />

Since the 1950s, in the countries that have reached a [[advanced capitalism|high level of industrialization]], the mass media of cinema, radio and TV have a key role in political power.<ref name="Eco67"/>

Contemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of [[concentration of media ownership]], with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms.<ref name="The SAGE Handbook of Media Studies"/>

In 2002, Arnold Kling wrote that "the newspaper business is going to die within the next twenty years. Newspaper publishing will continue, but only as a philanthropic venture." Jim Pinkerton said in 2006 of the future of mass media, "Every country with ambitions on the international stage will soon have its own state-supported media."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/06/the_future_of_m.html | title=The Future of Mass Media | publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc. | date=June 15, 2006 | accessdate=November 29, 2011 | author=Kling, Arnold}}</ref>
