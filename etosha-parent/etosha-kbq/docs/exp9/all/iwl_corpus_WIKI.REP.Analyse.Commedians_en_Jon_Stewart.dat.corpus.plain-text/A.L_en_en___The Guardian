'''''The Guardian''''' is a British centre-left national daily newspaper. Founded in 1821 as a local paper replacing the radical ''[[Manchester Observer]]'', it was known as '''''The Manchester Guardian''''' until 1959.

It has grown into a national paper, and forms part of a media group with international and online offshoots. Its sister papers include ''[[The Observer]]'' (a British Sunday paper) and ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'' (an international roundup of articles from various papers). In addition to its UK online edition [[theguardian.com]], the paper has two international web sites, [[Guardian Australia]] and [[Guardian US]]. ''The Guardian'' is influential in the design and publishing arena, sponsoring many awards in these areas. Other media projects include ''GuardianFilm''. ''The Guardian'' has been edited by [[Alan Rusbridger]] since 1995, with [[Katharine Viner]] designated to replace him in the summer of 2015.<ref name="Guardian200315">[http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/20/guardian-appoints-katharine-viner-new-editor-in-chief "Guardian appoints Katharine Viner as editor-in-chief"], ''The Guardian'', 20 March 2015</ref>

In August 2013 ''The Guardian'' in paper form had an average [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom by circulation|daily circulation]] of 189,000 copies, behind ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'', and ahead of ''[[The Independent]]''.<ref>National Newspapers Report, June 2013, published by the Audit Bureau of Circulation, http://abc.fileburst.com/publishedreports/National%20Newspapers%20Report%202013-06.pdf Accessed 12 July 2013.

==History==

===1821 to 1972===

====Early years====
''The Manchester Guardian'' was founded in Manchester in 1821 by cotton merchant [[John Edward Taylor]] with backing from the [[Little Circle]], a group of [[nonconformism|non-conformist]] businessmen.<ref name = "G">{{Cite news|title=Battle for the memory of Peterloo: Campaigners demand fitting tribute |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2007 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/13/britishidentity.artnews |accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London|last=Wainwright|first=Martin}}</ref> They launched their paper after the police closure of the more radical ''[[Manchester Observer]]'', the paper that had championed the cause of the [[Peterloo Massacre]] protesters.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Editorial|title=The Manchester Guardian, born 5 May 1821: 190 years&nbsp;– work in progress|date=4 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/05/manchester-guardian-work-in-progress}}</ref> Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers, writing: "(T)hey have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow-countrymen, from whose ill-requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence. 'They do not toil, neither do they spin,' but they live better than those that do.<ref>''Manchester Gazette'', 7 August 1819, quoted in {{Cite book| title= 'Guardian' : biography of a newspaper | last= Ayerst | first= David | year= 1971 | publisher=Collins | location= London | isbn= 0-00-211329-5 | page=20 }}</ref> When the government closed down the ''Manchester Observer'', the mill-owners' champions had the upper hand.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Poor men's guardians : a record of the struggles for a democratic newspaper press, 1763–1973 | last= Harrison |first= Stanley | year= 1974 | publisher=Lawrence and Wishart | location= London | isbn= 0-85315-308-6 | page=53}}</ref>

The influential journalist [[Jeremiah Garnett]] joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper, and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper.<ref name=dnbGarnett>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Garnett, Jeremiah|last=Garnett|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Garnett (writer)|volume=21|quote=''citing:'' [''Manchester Guardian'', 28 September 1870; ''Manchester Free Lance'', 1 October 1870 ; Prentice's Historical Sketches and Personal Recollections of Manchester; personal knowledge.]}}</ref>

The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would "zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty&nbsp;... warmly advocate the cause of Reform&nbsp;... endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and&nbsp;... support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scott Trust: History |publisher=Guardian Media Group |url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/ScottTrust/History/tabid/193/Default.aspx |accessdate=26 March 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080723175652/http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/ScottTrust/History/tabid/193/Default.aspx|archivedate=3 July 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In 1825 the paper merged with the ''British Volunteer'' and was known as '''The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer''' until 1828.<ref>[https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_3593893 Johns Hopkins Libraries:''The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer''], [Manchester, England] : Printed and published by J. Garnett, [1825-1828]</ref>

The working-class ''Manchester and Salford Advertiser'' called the ''Manchester Guardian'' "the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the mill-owners".<ref>21 May 1836</ref> The ''Manchester Guardian'' was generally hostile to labour's claims. Of the 1832 Ten Hours Bill the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition "the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=28 January 1832}}</ref> The ''Manchester Guardian'' dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators&nbsp;– "...&nbsp;if an accommodation can be effected the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone. They live on strife&nbsp;..."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=26 February 1873}}</ref>

''The Manchester Guardian'' was highly critical of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s conduct during the [[American Civil War]], writing on the news that Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated: "Of his rule, we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty&nbsp;..."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=27 April 1865}}</ref>

====C. P. Scott====
[[C. P. Scott]] made the newspaper nationally recognised. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the [[Second Boer War]] against popular opinion.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hampton, Mark|year=2011|title=The Press, Patriotism, and Public Discussion: C. P. Scott, the "Manchester Guardian", and the Boer War, 1899–1902|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=44|number=1|pages=177–197|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/3133666}}</ref> Scott supported the movement for [[women's suffrage]], but was critical of any tactics by the [[Suffragettes]] that involved [[direct action]]:<ref name="suffragettes">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/13/research.highereducation |title=Unladylike behaviour|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=28 July 2009 |publisher=Guardian News and Media|last=Purvis|first=June}}</ref> "The really ludicrous position is that [[David Lloyd George|Mr Lloyd George]] is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people's windows and breaking up benevolent societies' meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him". Scott thought the Suffragettes' "courage and devotion" was "worthy of a better cause and saner leadership".<ref>quoted in David Ayerst, ''The Guardian,'' 1971, p 353</ref> It has been argued that Scott's criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who "transgressed the gender expectations of [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian society]]".<ref name="suffragettes"/>

Scott commissioned [[J.M. Synge]] and his friend [[Jack Yeats]] to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland (pre-First World War), and these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection ''Travels in Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara''.<ref>{{cite news| last =Arnold | first =Bruce | title =To the waters and the wild | newspaper =Irish Independent| location =Dublin| pages = | language = | publisher =Independent News & Media| date =27 November 2012| url =http://www.independent.ie/incoming/to-the-waters-and-the-wild-26527736.html | accessdate =4 June 2014 }}</ref>

Scott's friendship with [[Chaim Weizmann]] played a role in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], and in 1948 ''The Guardian'' was a supporter of the new State of [[Israel]].

In June 1936 ownership of the paper passed to the [[Scott Trust]] (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper's independence.

====Spanish Civil War====
Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre-left [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. With the pro-Liberal ''[[News Chronicle]]'', the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-supporting ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]'s ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General [[Francisco Franco]]'s insurgent nationalists.

====Post-war====
The paper so loathed Labour's left-wing champion [[Aneurin Bevan]] "and the hate-gospellers of his entourage" that it called for [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]]'s post-war Labour government to be voted out of office.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Manchester Guardian|author=Leader|date=22 October 1951|title=Time for change?}}</ref> The newspaper opposed the creation of the [[National Health Service]] as it feared the state provision of healthcare would "eliminate selective elimination" and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people.<ref>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945–1951|first=David|last=Kynaston|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|page=285}}</ref>

The Manchester Guardian strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]: "The Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency. It pours petrol on a growing fire. There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow."  <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/10/pressandpublishing.egypt | title=Courage under fire | publisher=The Guardian | date=10 July 2006 | accessdate=5 March 2014 | author=Rusbridger Alan}}</ref>

===1972 to 2000===

====Northern Ireland====
When 13 civil rights demonstrators were killed on 30 January 1972, known as [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], by British soldiers in [[Northern Ireland]], ''The Guardian'' said that "Neither side can escape condemnation".<ref name="BloodySunday"/>  Of the protesters, they wrote, "The organisers of the demonstration, Miss [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]] among them, deliberately challenged the ban on marches. They knew that stone throwing and [[sniping]] could not be prevented, and that the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] might use the [[human shield|crowd as a shield]]."<ref name="BloodySunday">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/feb/01/bloodysunday.northernireland1|title=The division deepens|work=The Guardian|date=1 February 1972|author=Leader | location=London}}</ref>  Of the army, they wrote, "there seems little doubt that random shots were fired into the crowd, that aim was taken at individuals who were neither bombers nor weapons carriers and that excessive force was used."<ref name="BloodySunday"/>

Many Irish people believed that the [[Widgery Tribunal]]'s ruling on the killings was a whitewash,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |title=19 April 1972: 'Bloody Sunday' report excuses Army |publisher=BBC  |year=2008 |accessdate=28 July 2009|work=On this day 1950–2005}}</ref> a view that was also supported later with the publication of the [[Saville inquiry]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowcott |first=Owen |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/16/bloody-sunday-inquiry-derry-verdict |title=Bloody Sunday inquiry: 'We always knew the dead were innocent' |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> but in 1972 ''The Guardian'' declared that "Widgery's report is not one-sided" (20 April 1972<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/apr/20/bloodysunday.northernireland|title=To make history repeat itself|work=The Guardian|date=20 April 1972|author=Leader | location=London}}</ref>). The paper at the time also supported [[internment]] without trial in Northern Ireland: "Internment without trial is hateful, repressive and undemocratic. In the existing Irish situation, most regrettably, it is also inevitable.&nbsp;... .To remove the ringleaders, in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down, is a step to which there is no obvious alternative."<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 10 August 1971</ref> And before then, ''The Guardian'' had called for British troops to be sent to the region: British soldiers could "present a more disinterested face of law and order",<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 15 August 1969</ref> but only on condition that "Britain takes charge".<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 4 August 1969</ref>

====Social Democratic Party and New Labour====
Three of ''The Guardian'''s four leader writers joined the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] on its foundation in 1981, but the paper was enthusiastic in its support for [[Tony Blair]] in his successful bid to lead the Labour Party,<ref>{{cite news|title=Labour: the choice for the future|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2 July 1994|author=Leader}}</ref> and to be elected Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|title=A political earthquake: The Tory loss is cataclysmic; Labour's win historic|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=2 May 1997|author=Leader}}</ref>

====Sarah Tisdall====
In 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of [[cruise missile]]s in Britain that were leaked to ''The Guardian'' by civil servant [[Sarah Tisdall]]. The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a six-month prison sentence for Tisdall,<ref>Paul Routledge [http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-hunter-of-the-truth-lord-justice-scott-with-the-government-rattled-paul-routledge-looks-at-the-man-john-major-now-has-to-face-1407249.html "Profile: Hunter of the truth: Lord justice Scott: With the Government rattled, Paul Routledge looks at the man John Major now has to face",] ''The Independent on Sunday'', 16 January 1994</ref> though she served only four. "I still blame myself", said [[Peter Preston]] who was the editor of ''The Guardian'' at the time, but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it "believed in the rule of law".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/05/pressandpublishing.politicsandthemedia|title=A source of great regret|work=The Guardian|date=5 September 2005| location=London|last=Preston|first=Peter}}</ref>

====First Gulf War====
In the lead-up to the first [[Gulf War]], between 1990 and 1991, ''The Guardian'' expressed doubts about military action against Iraq: "Frustration in the Gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of task forces and tactical bombing, but the military option is no option at all. The emergence yesterday of a potential hostage problem of vast dimensions only emphasised that this is far too complex a crisis for gunboat diplomacy. Loose talk of 'carpet bombing' Baghdad should be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable scenarios".<ref>{{cite news|title=Choosing the best option|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=6 August 1990|author=Leader}}</ref>

But on the eve of the war, the paper rallied to the war cause: "The simple cause, at the end, is just. An evil regime in Iraq instituted an evil and brutal invasion. Our soldiers and airmen are there, at UN behest, to set that evil to rights. Their duties are clear.&nbsp;... Let the momentum, and the resolution, be swift."<ref>{{cite news|title=Suddenly the sky turns orange|work=The Guardian|date=17 January 1991|author=Leader}}</ref> After the event, journalist [[Maggie O'Kane]] conceded that she and her colleagues had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda: "...&nbsp;we, the media, were harnessed like 2,000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the British and US military wanted us to see in this nice clean war."<ref>"Bloodless words bloody war: In a Guardian/Channel 4 investigation across three continents, Maggie O'Kane follows the trail of lies, cover-ups and carnage that were the truth behind the 'clean' war in the Gulf." ''Guardian'' [London, England] 16 December 1995: 12. ''General Reference Center GOLD.'' Web. 12 December 2011.</ref>

====Journalist allegedly working for Russian intelligence services====
In 1995, [[KGB]] defector [[Oleg Gordievsky]] identified prominent ''Guardian'' editor [[Richard Gott]] as one of his agents. While Gott denied that he received cash, he confessed taking benefits from the KGB on a visit to the [[Soviet Union]].

Gordievsky commented on the newspaper: "The KGB loved ''The Guardian''. It was deemed highly susceptible to penetration".<ref name="findarticles.com">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n7_v11/ai_16679970/pg_2/ Spies, in from the cold, snitch on collaborators].

====Jonathan Aitken====
In 1995, both the [[Granada Television]] programme ''[[World In Action]]'' and ''The Guardian'' were sued for [[libel]] by the then cabinet minister [[Jonathan Aitken#Libel, arrest and prison|Jonathan Aitken]], for their allegation that the [[Harrods]] owner [[Mohamed Al Fayed]] had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]] in Paris, which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken's part. Aitken publicly stated he would fight with "the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/apr/11/uk1|title='The simple sword of truth'|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 April 1995  |accessdate=25 May 2010|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> The court case proceeded, and in 1997 ''The Guardian'' produced evidence that Aitken's claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/jun/21/uk.davidpallister|title=He lied and lied and lied|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=21 June 1997|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|last2=Pallister|first2=David|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> In 1999, Aitken was jailed for [[perjury]] and [[perverting the course of justice]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/258070.stm|title=Aitken pleads guilty to perjury|work=BBC News|date=19 January 1999}}</ref>

====Kosovo====
The paper supported [[NATO]]'s military intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. Though the [[United Nations Security Council]] did not support the action, ''The Guardian'' stated that "the only honourable course for Europe and America is to use military force".<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 23 March 1999</ref> [[Mary Kaldor]]'s piece was headlined "Bombs away! But to save civilians we must get in some soldiers too."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/25/balkans8|title=Bombs away!

====Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq====
The paper endorsed the argument that Iraq had to be disarmed of '[[Weapons of Mass Destruction]]': "It is not credible to argue, as Iraq did in its initial reaction to [[Colin Powell|Mr Powell]] [at the Security Council], that it is simply all lies.&nbsp;... Iraq must disarm."<ref>''The Guardian',' leader, 6 February 2003</ref>

====Accusations of anti-Semitism and bias in coverage of Israel====
In recent decades ''The Guardian'' has been accused of biased [[criticism of Israel]]i government policy.<ref name=Sela>[[Hadar Sela]], ''[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]]'', [http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2010/06/sela.html Anti-Zionist And Antisemitic Discourse On The Guardian's Comment Is Free Website]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}, Volume 14, No. 2&nbsp;– June 2010</ref> In December 2003, columnist [[Julie Burchill]] cited "striking bias against the state of Israel" as one of the reasons she left the paper for ''The Times''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/nov/29/weekend.julieburchill|title=Good, bad and ugly|work=The Guardian|date=29 November 2003|authorlink= Julie Burchill | location=London|last=Burchill|first=Julie}}</ref> A leaked report from the European Monitoring Centre on Racism cited ''The Economist'''s claim that for "many British Jews," the British media's reporting on Israel "is spiced with a tone of animosity, 'as to smell of anti-Semitism'&nbsp;... This is above all the case with the ''Guardian'' and ''[[The Independent]]''". The EU said the report, dated February 2003 was not published because it was insubstantial in its current state and lacking sufficient evidence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/eu.politics1|title=Leaked report shows rise in anti-semitism|work=The Guardian|date=4 December 2003| location=London|last=MacAskill|first=Ewen}}</ref><ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/report_uk.html Leaked report] hosted on Jewish Virtual Library</ref>

Responding to these accusations, a ''Guardian'' editorial in 2002 condemned anti-Semitism and defended the paper's right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government, arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti-Jewish are mistaken.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/26/israel.guardianleaders |title=Leader: A new anti-semitism? |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 26 January 2002|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref> Harriet Sherwood, then ''The Guardian's'' foreign editor, later its Jerusalem correspondent, has also denied ''The Guardian'' has an anti-Israel bias, saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1931208,00.html |title=News coverage |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>

On 6 November 2011, Chris Elliott, the ''Guardian''{{'}}s readers' editor, wrote that "Guardian reporters, writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel," citing recent cases where ''The Guardian'' received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel. Elliott noted that, over nine months, he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti-Semitic, revising the language and footnoting this change.<ref name="Elliott responds">{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/06/averting-accusations-of-antisemitism-guardian | title=The readers' editor on&nbsp;... averting accusations of antisemitism | publisher=''The Guardian'' | date=6 November 2011 | accessdate=3 October 2012 | author=Elliott, Chris}}</ref>

On 11 August 2014 the print edition of ''The Guardian'' published an advocacy advert during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]] featuring [[Elie Wiesel]], headed by the words "Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago. Now it's Hamas' turn." ''The Times'' of London had decided against running the ad, although it had already appeared in major American newspapers.<ref>Meredith Carey [http://observer.com/2014/08/exclusive-the-guardian-accepts-the-elie-weisel-ad-rejected-by-london-times/ "Exclusive: The Guardian Accepts the Elie Wiesel Ad Rejected by London Times"], ''New York Observer'', 7 August 2014</ref>  One week later Chris Elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/readers-editor-decision-this-world-advertisement |title=The readers' editor on... the decision to run This World's advertisement |last1=Elliott |first1=Chris|date=18 August 2014 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

====Clark County====
In August 2004, for the [[US presidential election, 2004|US presidential election]], the daily ''G2'' supplement launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in [[Clark County, Ohio]], an average-sized county in a [[swing state]]. The editor of the ''G2'' supplement [[Ian Katz]] bought a voter list from the county for $25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election, giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against US President George W. Bush. The paper scrapped "Operation Clark County" on 21 October 2004 after first publishing a column of responses&nbsp;— nearly all of them outraged&nbsp;— to the campaign under the headline "Dear Limey assholes".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/18/uselections2004.usa2|title=Dear Limey assholes|accessdate=13 May 2008|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 October 2004 }}</ref>  The public's dislike of the campaign likely contributed to Bush's victory in Clark County.<ref name="bowers">Bowers, Andy.

====Guardian America====
In 2007, the paper launched a website Guardian America, an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States, which at the time stood at more than 5.9m. The company hired former ''[[American Prospect]]'' editor, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine columnist and ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' writer [[Michael Tomasky]] to head up the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors. The site featured ''Guardian'' news relevant to an American audience: coverage of US news and the Middle East, for example.<ref>''New York Observer'', 4 September 2007, [http://observer.com/2007/09/iguardiani-reclaims-america/ The Guardian Reclaims America]</ref>

Tomasky stepped down from his position as ''Guardian'' American editor in February 2009, ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff. He retained his position as a columnist and blogger, taking the title editor-at-large.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/18/michael-tomasky-editor-democracy|title=Michael Tomasky joins political journal Democracy|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 February 2009|last=Kiss|first=Jemima|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref>

In October 2009, the company abandoned the ''Guardian'' America homepage, instead directing users to a US news index page on the main website.<ref>''paidContent.org'', 20 October 2009, [http://paidcontent.org/2009/10/20/419-gnm-axing-guardianamerica-com-shuffling-execs-in-restructure/ GNM Axing GuardianAmerica.com, Shuffling Execs in Restructure]</ref> The next month, the company laid off six American employees, including a reporter, a multimedia producer and four web editors. The move came as Guardian News and Media opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a massive effort to cut costs across the company.<ref>''paidContent.org'', 5 November 2009, [http://paidcontent.org/2009/11/06/419-guardian-news-and-media-laying-off-seven-employees-in-u-s/ Guardian News And Media Laying Off Six Employees In U.S.] paidcontent.org</ref>  In subsequent years, however, ''The Guardian'' has hired various commentators on US affairs including [[Ana Marie Cox]], [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]], [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Glenn Greenwald]] and former George W. Bush speechwriter [[Josh Treviño]].<ref name="Treviño">[http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/9 The Guardian adds Josh Treviño to growing US team].</ref> Treviño's first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in June 2011 over the second Gaza flotilla, the controversy over which had been revived by the appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/16/2011-gaza-flotilla-tweet-clarification?commentpage=all#start-of-comments|title=My 2011 Gaza flotilla tweet: a clarification|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>

====Gagged from reporting Parliament====
In October 2009, ''The Guardian'' reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter, namely a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week.<ref>[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmordbk2/cmob2.htm Part 2: Oral or Written Questions from Wednesday 14 October 2009]</ref> The paper noted that it was being "forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret. The only fact the ''Guardian'' can report is that the case involves the London solicitors [[Carter-Ruck]]." The paper further claimed that this case appears "to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the [[1688 Bill of Rights]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/12/guardian-gagged-from-reporting-parliament|title=Guardian gagged from reporting parliament|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 October 2009|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter-Ruck in the relevant period was by [[Paul Farrelly]] MP, in reference to legal action by [[Barclays]] and [[Trafigura]].<ref>Question 292409: "Paul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme): To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of legislation to protect (a) whistleblowers and (b) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by (i) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and (ii) Trafigura and Carter-Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast, commissioned by Trafigura."[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmordbk2/91014o01.htm]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=Press Gazette|date=13 October 2009|title=Guardian gagged from reporting Parliament|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/44460|publisher=Progressive Media International|location=London|first=Dominic|last=Ponsford}}</ref> The part of the question referencing Carter-Ruck relates to the latter company's September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report<ref>[[Wikileaks]], [http://www.wikileaks.com/wiki/Minton_report:_Trafigura_Toxic_dumping_along_the_Ivory_Coast_broke_EU_regulations,_14_Sep_2006 Minton report: Trafigura toxic dumping along the Ivory Coast broke EU regulations, 14 Sep 2006]</ref> into the [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump]] scandal, which involved a [[class action]] case that the company only settled in September 2009 after ''The Guardian'' published some of the commodity trader's internal emails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-oil-ivory-coast|title=How UK oil company Trafigura tried to cover up African pollution disaster|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 September 2009|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> The reporting injunction was lifted the next day, as Carter-Ruck withdrew it before ''The Guardian'' could challenge it in the High Court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-gagged-parliamentary-question|title=Gag on Guardian reporting MP's Trafigura question lifted|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 October 2009|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> [[Alan Rusbridger]] credited the rapid back-down of Carter-Ruck to Twitter,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/oct/14/trafigura-fiasco-tears-up-textbook |title=The Trafigura fiasco tears up the textbook |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=14 October 2009 |accessdate=25 January 2010 |last=Rusbridger|first=Alan|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> as did a BBC article.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8304908.stm |title=When is a secret not a secret? |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=25 January 2010|last=Higham|first=Nick|work=BBC News}}</ref>

In June 2013 the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] telephone records held by [[Barack Obama]]'s administration in June 2013,<ref name="reuters.com"/> and subsequently revealed the existence of the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]] after it was leaked to the paper by former [[National Security Agency|NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]].<ref name="theguardian.com"/> The newspaper was subsequently contacted by the British government's Cabinet Secretary, [[Jeremy Heywood|Sir Jeremy Heywood]], under instruction from the Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who ordered that the hard drives containing the information must be destroyed.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23776063 "Edward Snowden files: No 10 contacted Guardian"] BBC News, 21 August 2013</ref> ''The Guardian'''s offices were then visited in July by agents from the UK's [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]], who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from Snowden.<ref>[http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/rusbridger-tells-of-hard-drive-destruction-4680075.html "Rusbridger tells of hard drive destruction"] ''The Age'', 21 August 2013</ref> In June 2014 ''[[The Register]]'' reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a "beyond top secret" internet monitoring base in [[Seeb]], [[Oman]] and the close involvement of [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]] in intercepting internet communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base|title=Revealed: GCHQ's beyond top secret middle eastern internet spy base|publisher=The Register|author=Duncan Campbell|date=3 June 2014}}</ref>

==Ownership==
[[File:The Guardian Building Window in London.JPG|thumb|right|''The Guardian's'' HQ in [[London]]]]
''The Guardian'' is part of the GMG [[Guardian Media Group]] of newspapers, radio stations, print media including ''[[The Observer]]'' Sunday newspaper, ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'' international newspaper, and new media—''Guardian Abroad'' website, and ''[[theguardian.com|guardian.co.uk]]''. All the aforementioned were owned by [[Scott Trust Limited|The Scott Trust]], a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008, which aimed to ensure the paper's [[editorial independence]] in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to take overs by for-profit media groups. At the beginning of October 2008, the Scott Trusts assets were transferred to a new limited company, The Scott Trust Limited, with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up.<ref>{{Cite news  |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/08/theguardian.theobserver |title=Guardian owner the Scott Trust to be wound up after 72 years|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 October 2008|accessdate=10 October 2008 |last=Conlan|first=Tara|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> [[Liz Forgan|Dame Liz Forgan]], chair of the Scott Trust, reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained as under the previous arrangements.

''The Guardian'' has been consistently loss-making. The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes ''The Observer'', reported operating losses of £49.9m in 2006, up from £18.6m in 2005.<ref>Guardian Media Group plc 2006. "[http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/gmgplc/media/news/article/article110.html Guardian Media Group 2005/6 results]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}".</ref> The paper is therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group, including ''[[Auto Trader (UK)|Auto Trader]]'' (which the Guardian Media Group sold in January 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/01/guardian-sells-trader-media|title=The Guardian sells Trader Media|date=21 January 2014|work=The Economist|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>).

''The Guardian'''s ownership by the Scott Trust is probably a factor in its being the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental [[audit]] in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company.<ref>Guardian Newspapers Ltd & Scott Trust, 2005. "[http://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit Social, ethical and environmental audit, 2005]".</ref> It is also the only British daily national newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the "readers' editor") to handle complaints and corrections.

''The Guardian'' and its parent groups participate in [[Project Syndicate]], established by [[George Soros]], and intervened in 1995 to save the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' in South Africa, but Guardian Media Group sold the majority of its shares in the ''Mail & Guardian'' in 2002.

The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the Guardian Media Group caused the group to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor [[Trinity Mirror]] in March 2010. This included the flagship ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', and severed the historic link between that paper and ''The Guardian''. The sale was in order to safeguard the future of ''The Guardian'' newspaper as is the intended purpose of the Scott Trust.<ref name="M.E.N sold to Trinity Mirror">{{cite news |title=Manchester Evening News sold by Guardian Media Group |publisher=M.E.N.

In June 2011 Guardian News and Media revealed increased annual losses of £33m and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage, leaving a physical newspaper that was to contain more comment and features. It was also speculated that ''The Guardian'' may become the first British national daily paper to go solely online.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rayner |first=Gordon |title=Riches to rags as Guardian bleeds £33m in a year |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 June 2011 |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8583220/Riches-to-rags-as-Guardian-bleeds-33m-in-a-year.html |accessdate=21 October 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian and Observer to adopt 'digital-first' strategy |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=16 June 2011 |url= http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/16/guardian-observer-digital-first-strategy?INTCMP=SRCH |accessdate=21 October 2011|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

For the three years up to June 2012, the paper lost £100,000 a day, which prompted ''Intelligent Life'' to question whether ''The Guardian'' can survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/ideas/tim-de-lisle/can-guardian-survive |title=Can The Guardian Survive? |publisher=More Intelligent Life |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>

==Political stance and editorial opinion==
Founded by textile traders and merchants, ''The Guardian'' had a reputation as "an organ of the middle class",<ref>[[Frederick Engels]], ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', Progress, 1973, p. 109.</ref> or in the words of C.P. Scott's son Ted, "a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last".<ref>Ayerst, ''The Guardian'', 1971, p. 471.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}</ref> "I write for the ''Guardian''," said [[Max Hastings|Sir Max Hastings]] in 2005,<ref>{{cite news|title=Smaller size, higher brow?|first=Mark|last=Seddon|work=New Statesman|location=London|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200502210005|date=21 February 2005}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> "because it is read by the new establishment", reflecting the paper's then growing influence.

The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion: a [[MORI]] poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80% of ''Guardian'' readers were Labour Party voters;<ref>''[[International Socialism (journal)|International Socialism]]'' Spring 2003, ISBN 1-898876-97-5</ref> according to another MORI poll taken in 2005, 48% of ''Guardian'' readers were Labour voters and 34% [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] voters.<ref>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/content/polls-05/voting-intention-by-newspaper-readership-quarter-1.ashx Voting Intention by Newspaper Readership Quarter 1 2005]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}, Ipsos MORI, 21 April 2005

===Publication history===
[[File:GuardianNewsroom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The Guardian'''s Newsroom visitor centre and archive (No 60), with an old sign with the name ''The Manchester Guardian'']]

The first edition was published on 5 May 1821,<ref>Schoolnet n.d. "[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/PRguardian.htm Manchester Guardian]."</ref> at which time ''The Guardian'' was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7[[penny|d]].; the [[stamp duty]] on newspapers (4d. per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836 ''The Guardian'' added a Wednesday edition; with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.

In 1952, the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. Then-editor A. P. Wadsworth wrote: "It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion."

In 1959, the paper dropped "Manchester" from its title, becoming simply ''The Guardian'', and in 1964 it moved to London, losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the less intellectual but much more profitable ''Manchester Evening News''. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with ''The Times''. The paper consolidated its centre-left stance during the 1970s and 1980s but was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of ''The Independent'' in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation.

On 12 February 1988, ''The Guardian'' had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an [[italic type|italic]] [[Garamond]] "''The''", with a bold [[Helvetica]] "'''Guardian'''", that remained in use until the 2005 redesign.

In 1992, it relaunched its features section as ''G2'', a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other "quality" broadsheets, and ultimately led to the rise of "compact" papers and ''The Guardian'''s move to the Berliner format. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet [[price war]] started by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''The Times''. In June 1993, ''The Guardian'' bought ''The Observer'' from [[Lonrho]], thus gaining a serious Sunday newspaper partner with similar political views. (In Britain daily newspapers are not published on Sundays; there are instead Sunday-only newspapers. Many daily newspapers have sister Sunday publications, often named similarly: ''The Times'', ''Sunday Times''.)

Its international weekly edition is now titled ''The Guardian Weekly'', though it retained the title ''Manchester Guardian Weekly'' for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. ''The Guardian Weekly'' is also linked to a website for expatriates, [[Guardian Abroad]], which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012.

''G24'' is a constantly updated electronic newspaper available free of charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/g24 |title=G24 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> It is downloadable as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file. The contents come from ''The Guardian'' and its Sunday sibling ''The Observer''.

===Moving to the Berliner paper format===
''The Guardian'' is printed in full colour,<ref>{{Cite news

}}</ref> and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format for its main section, while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid, approximately A4, and pocket-size (approximately A5).

In 2004, ''The Guardian'' announced plans to change to a "Berliner" or "[[midi (newspaper)|midi]]" format similar to that used by ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' in Germany, ''Le Monde'' in France and many other European papers; at 470×315&nbsp;mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change followed the moves by ''The Independent'' and ''[[The Times]]'' to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday 1 September 2005 ''The Guardian'' announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005.
<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/01/theguardian.pressandpublishing|title=New-look Guardian launches on September 12|work=MediaGuardian|date=1 September 2005|last1=Cozens|first1=Claire|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> Sister Sunday newspaper ''The Observer'' went over to the same format on 8 January 2006.

The advantage that ''The Guardian'' saw in the Berliner format was that though it is only a little wider than a tabloid, and is thus equally easy to read on public transport, its greater height gives more flexibility in page design. The new presses mean that printing can go right across the "gutter", the strip down the middle of the centre page, allowing the paper to print striking double page pictures. The new presses also made the paper the first UK national able to print in full colour on every page.

The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its new-look front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005. Designed by [[Mark Porter (designer)|Mark Porter]], the new look includes a new [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family designed by [[Paul Barnes (designer)|Paul Barnes]] and [[Christian Schwartz]] was created for the new design. With just over 200 fonts, it is "one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper."<ref name="fontshop2006">{{cite web

|publisher=FontShop Benelux
|date=15 November 2006

|title=Does type design matter in newspapers?
|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>
Especially notable is Guardian Egyptian, a highly legible [[slab serif]] that is used in various weights for both text and headlines and is central to the redesign.

The switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80&nbsp;million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This was because, before ''The Guardian'''s move, no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications as one of the paper's presses was part-owned by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph Newspapers]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express|Express Newspapers]]'', and it was contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the Guardian Media Group's north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.

====Reception====
The new format was generally well received by ''Guardian'' readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes. The only controversy was over the dropping of the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' cartoon strip. The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss; within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. ''G2'' supplement editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, "I'm sorry, once again, that I made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address—so cross".<ref>{{Wayback |date=20070212135000 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1600349,00.html |title=''Guardian Reborn'', The Guardian}}. Retrieved on 22 July 2007. {{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> Some readers were, however, dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all-colour sports section meant that coverage of late-finishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country.

The investment was rewarded with a circulation rise. In December 2005, the average daily sale stood at 380,693, nearly 6% higher than the figure for December 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/13/abcs.pressandpublishing|title=Telegraph sales hit all-time low|work=MediaGuardian|date=13 January 2006|last1=Cozens|first1=Claire|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> (However as of December 2012, circulation has since dropped to 204,222.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/11/guardian-telegraph-financial-times-december-abcs|title=Guardian, Telegraph and FT post modest sales rises in December|date=11 January 2013|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref>) In 2006, the US-based [[Society for News Design]] chose ''The Guardian'' and Polish daily ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' as the world's best-designed newspapers—from among 389 entries from 44 countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/21/theguardian.pressandpublishing |title=Guardian wins design award |date=21 February 2006 |work=MediaGuardian |location=London |last=Busfield|first=Steve|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref>

==Regular content and features==
On each weekday ''The Guardian'' comes with the ''G2'' supplement containing feature articles, columns, television and radio listings, and the quick crossword. Since the change to the Berliner format, there is a separate daily Sport section. Other regular supplements during the week are shown below.

Before the redesign in 2005, the main news section was in the large broadsheet format, but the supplements were all in the half-sized tabloid format, with the exception of the glossy ''Weekend'' section, which was a 290×245&nbsp;mm magazine, and ''The Guide'', which was in a small 225×145&nbsp;mm format.

With the change of the main section to the Berliner format, the specialist sections are now printed as Berliner, as is a now-daily Sports section, but ''G2'' has moved to a "magazine-sized" demi-Berliner format. A Thursday Technology section and daily science coverage in the news section replaced Life and Online. ''Weekend'' and ''The Guide'' are still in the same small formats as before the change.

On Monday to Thursday prior to the recession, the supplements carried substantial quantities of recruitment advertising as well as editorial on their specialised topics. However, this has diminished since the onset of recession, to the point that the supplements have been seriously contracted or no longer appear as independent sections. The formerly sixty-page-thick ''Society'' supplement (Wednesday) is now no more and has been absorbed into the main part of the paper.

==GuardianFilms==
In 2003, ''The Guardian'' started the film production company GuardianFilms, headed by journalist Maggie O'Kane. Much of the company's output is documentary made for television– and it has included [[Salam Pax]]'s ''[[Baghdad Blogger]]'' for [[BBC Two]]'s daily flagship ''[[Newsnight]]'', some of which have been shown in compilations by ''[[CNN]] International'', ''Sex On The Streets'' and ''Spiked'', both made for the UK's [[Channel 4]] television.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/guardianfilms |title=Films |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 12 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2009 }}</ref>

"GuardianFilms was born in a sleeping bag in the Burmese [[rainforest]]," wrote O'Kane in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-7-2003-47360.asp |title=Maggie O'Kane: Bringing the Guardian's Ethos to Tv |publisher=Buzzle.com |date=7 November 2003 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> "I was a foreign correspondent for the paper, and it had taken me weeks of negotiations, dealing with shady contacts and a lot of walking to reach the cigar-smoking Karen twins– the boy soldiers who were leading attacks against the country's ruling junta. After I had reached them and written a cover story for the newspaper's ''G2'' section, I got a call from the [[BBC]]'s documentary department, which was researching a film on child soldiers. Could I give them all my contacts?

"The plight of the Karen people, who were forced into slave labour in the rainforest to build pipelines for oil companies (some of them British), was a tale of human suffering that needed to be told by any branch of the media that was interested. I handed over all the names and numbers I had, as well as details of the secret route through [[Thailand]] to get into [[Burma]]. Good girl. Afterwards– and not for the first time– it seemed to me that we at ''The Guardian'' should be using our resources ourselves. Instead of providing contact numbers for any independent TV company prepared to get on the phone to a journalist, we should make our own films."

According to GuardianFilms's own webpage, its international work has focused on training talented local journalists based on the premise that "the era of a traditional London or Washington based foreign correspondent or fireman is coming to an end and the world urgently needs a more searching challenging journalism brought to us by people who speak the language and can secure access far beyond the "Green Zone Journalist" limits of the traditional correspondent." It says it is especially focused on reporting the Muslim world in a more challenging manner, and has trained a number of journalists in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/guardianfilms |title=Films homepage |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 12 February 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010 }}</ref>

==The Guardian News & Media Archive==
''The Guardian'' and its sister newspaper ''The Observer'' opened ''The Newsroom'', an archive and visitor centre in London, in 2002. The centre preserved and promoted the histories and values of the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions. The Newsroom's activities all transferred to Kings Place in 2008.<ref name="test">{{cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/interactive/guardian-interactive-timeline | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Lisa | last=Villani | title=MIC: GNM archive (microsite) | date=20 August 2009}}</ref> Now known as the Guardian News & Media Archive, the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers. The archive holds official records of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers. As well as corporate records, the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/archive-collections | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=MIC: GNM archive (microsite) | date=26 August 2009}}</ref> This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment. There is also an extensive ''Manchester Guardian'' archive at the [[University of Manchester]]'s [[John Rylands University Library]] and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. The [[British Library]] also has a large archive of ''The Manchester Guardian'', available in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM in their
[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/ British Library Newspapers] collection.

In November 2007 ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' made their archives available over the internet via [http://archive.guardian.co.uk/ DigitalArchive]. The current extent of the archives available are 1821 to 2000 for ''The Guardian'' and 1791 to 2000 for ''The Observer'': these archives will eventually run up to 2003.

The Newsroom's other components were also transferred to Kings Place in 2008. ''The Guardian''<nowiki></nowiki>'s [http://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre Education Centre] provides a range of educational programmes for students and adults. ''The Guardian'''s [http://www.theguardian.com/gnmexhibitions exhibition space] was also moved to Kings Place, and has a rolling programme of exhibitions that investigate and reflect upon aspects of news and newspapers and the role of journalism. This programme often draws on the archive collections held in the GNM Archive.
