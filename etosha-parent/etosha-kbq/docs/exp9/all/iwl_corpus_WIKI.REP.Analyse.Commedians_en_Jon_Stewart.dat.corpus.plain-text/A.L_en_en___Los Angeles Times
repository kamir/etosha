The '''''Los Angeles Times''''', commonly referred to as the '''''Times''''', is a daily [[newspaper]] published in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], since 1881. It was the largest metropolitan newspaper in circulation in the United States in 2008 and the fourth most widely distributed newspaper in the country.<ref>[[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation]]</ref> In 2000, the [[Tribune Company]], parent company of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and local television station [[KTLA]], purchased the ''Los Angeles Times''.<ref name=Tribune>{{cite news|title=Tribune called on to sell L.A.

{{See also|List of Los Angeles Times publishers}}
[[File:Chandler and Otis 001.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Chandler and Otis 1917]]

===Otis era===
The ''Times'' was first published on December 4, 1881, as the ''Los Angeles Daily Times'' under the direction of [[Nathan Cole Jr.]] and [[Thomas Gardiner (publisher)|Thomas Gardiner]]. It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by [[Jesse Yarnell]] and [[T.J. Caystile]]. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, [[S.J. Mathes]] had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the ''Times'' continued publication. In July 1882, [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]] moved from [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to become the paper's editor.<ref name=LAT1923>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=354598012&sid=50&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Mirror Acorn, 'Times' Oak," ''Los Angeles Times,'' October 23, 1923, page II-1] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Otis made the ''Times'' a financial success.

In an era where newspapers were driven by party politics, the ''Times'' was directed at [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] readers. As was typical of newspapers of the time, the ''Times'' would sit on stories for several days, notably including the [[Election of 1884|1884]] victory of Democratic presidential candidate [[Grover Cleveland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethics.journalism.wisc.edu/2011/04/20/the-fall-and-rise-of-partisan-journalism/ | title=The Fall and Rise of Partisan Journalism | author=James L. Baughman  | publisher=ethics.journalism.wisc.edu | date=April 20, 2011| accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref>

Historian [[Kevin Starr]] wrote that Otis was a businessman "capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment".<ref>

</ref> Otis's editorial policy was based on civic [[boosterism]], extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the [[Owens Valley]] in the [[California Water Wars]], a set of events fictionalized in the [[Roman Polanski]] movie [[Chinatown (1974 movie)|''Chinatown'']].

[[Image:Photo-los-angeles-times-building-post-bombing.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Rubble of the ''L.A. Times'' building after the [[Los Angeles Times bombing|1910 bombing]]]]
The efforts of the ''Times'' to fight local unions led to the October 1, 1910, [[Los Angeles Times bombing|bombing of its headquarters]], killing twenty-one people. Two union leaders, [[McNamara brothers|James and Joseph McNamara]], were charged. The [[American Federation of Labor]] hired noted trial attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.

Otis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new ''Times'' headquarters building designed by [[Gordon Kaufmann]], proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: "Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True."<ref>{{cite book|last=Berges|first=Marshall|title=The Life and Times of Los Angeles: A Newspaper, A Family and A City|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|page=25}}</ref><ref name="answers.com">[http://www.answers.com/topic/clarence-darrow Clarence Darrow: Biography and Much More from Answers.com<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.answers.com</ref>

===Chandler era===
Upon Otis's death in 1917, his son-in-law, [[Harry Chandler]], took control as publisher of the ''Times''. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, [[Norman Chandler]], who ran the paper during the rapid growth of [[post-war]] Los Angeles. Norman's wife, [[Dorothy Buffum Chandler]], became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], whose main concert hall was named the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in her honor. Family members are buried at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.

[[Image:1984-Newspaper-Vending-Machine.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Times'' [[Newspaper vending machine]] featuring news of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]]]
The fourth generation of family publishers, [[Otis Chandler]], held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the [[Northeastern United States]] due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, notably ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]''. Believing that the newsroom was "the heartbeat of the business",<ref name="mcdougal">

</ref> Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with the ''Washington Post'' to form the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations.

During the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.

Writing in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, ''Times'' reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:

<blockquote>The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the ''Los Angeles Times'' under the Chandler family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20130807,0,2277462.column|title=Washington Post Buy: Can Jeff Bezos Fix Newspapers' Business Model?|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> </blockquote>

The paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history ''Thinking Big'' (1977, ISBN 0-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by [[David Halberstam]] in ''[[The Powers That Be (book)|The Powers That Be]]'' (1979, ISBN 0-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN 0-252-06941-2). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.<ref>''ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts''.

===Modern era===
{{main|Los Angeles Times in the 21st century}}
[[Image:LATimesBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Los Angeles Times Building]], seen from the corner of 1st and Spring streets]]
The ''Times'' was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation and the need to increase its Web presence.

In 2000, the [[Tribune Company]] acquired the ''Times'', placing the paper in co-ownership with then-WB (now [[CW Television Network|CW]])-affiliated [[KTLA]], which Tribune acquired in 1985.<ref name=Tribune />

For two days in 2005, the ''Times'' experimented with [[Wikitorial]], the first [[Wiki]] by a major news organization to allow readers to combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. However, they shut it down after a few people besieged it with inappropriate material.

In December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/09/business/fi-tribune9| title=Owner of L.A.

The single copy rate is $2. Since March 2015 the paper increased its daily price $0.50 (33.3%) to match its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day rate (at [[newspaper vending machine|newsracks]] tax included; price is higher in designated state areas).

==Pulitzer prizes==
Through 2014, the ''Times'' had won 41 [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]s, including four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 [[Watts Riots]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/services/newspaper/mediacenter/la-mediacenter-pulitzers,0,6930216.story |title=Los Angeles Times – Media Center |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 17, 1994 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}</ref>

''Times'' reporters Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Explanatory Reporting in 2009 "for their fresh and painstaking exploration into the cost and effectiveness of attempts to combat the growing menace of wildfires across the western United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/04/20/2009-pulitzer-prizes-journalism/|title=2009 Pulitzer Prizes: Journalism|work=Reuters|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Competition and rivalry==

In the 19th century, the chief competition to the ''Times'' was the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Herald]],'' followed by the smaller ''[[Los Angeles Tribune]].'' In December 1903, newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] began publishing the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' as a direct morning competitor to the ''Times.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulwaf.com/LA-1900s/03.12.html |title=December 1903: Hearst's Examiner comes to L.A |publisher=Ulwaf.com |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref> In the 20th century, the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Express]]'' was an afternoon competitor, as was [[Manchester Boddy]]'s '' [[Los Angeles Daily News (historic)|Los Angeles Daily News]]'', a Democratic newspaper.<ref name=RedInk>[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL11566287M/Red_Ink_White_Lies Red Ink, White Lies: The Rise and Fall of Los Angeles Newspapers, 1920–1962] by Rob Leicester Wagner, Dragonflyer Press, 2000.</ref>

By the mid-1940s, the ''Times'' was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. In 1948, it launched the ''Los Angeles Mirror,'' an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the ''Daily News'' and the merged ''Herald-Express''. In 1954, the ''Mirror'' absorbed the ''Daily News''. The combined paper, the ''Mirror-News,'' ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon [[Los Angeles Herald Examiner|''Herald-Express'']] and the morning ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' merged to become the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner]]''.<ref name="Pitt">Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt, ''Los Angeles: A to Z,'' University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-20274-0.</ref>

The ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner]]'' published its last number in 1989. Today the second-largest daily newspaper in Los Angeles is the [[San Fernando Valley]]-based ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' (unrelated to the aforementioned defunct publication).

===Midwinter and midsummer===

====Midwinter====
For 69 years, from 1885<ref>[http://socalhistory.org/bios/otis.html Harrison Gray Otis Southern California Historical Society]</ref> until 1954, the ''Times'' issued on New Year's Day a special annual Midwinter Number or Midwinter Edition that extolled the virtues of Southern California. At first it was called the "Trade Number," and in 1886 it featured a special press run of "extra scope and proportions"; that is, "a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed."<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=319655972&sid=25&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Our Annual Trade Number," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 18, 1886, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Two years later, the edition had grown to "forty-eight handsome pages (9x15 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation," was "equivalent to a 150-page book."<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=318936802&sid=26&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Our Annual Edition," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 21, 1888, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> The last use of the phrase ''Trade Number'' was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=321696492&sid=34&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "General Contents," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 1, 1895] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

The Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from the ''Kansas City Star'' in 1923:

{{quote|It is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages – the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=328889372&sid=20&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP Quoted in "Highest Praise Given to 'Times,'" ''Los Angeles Times'', January 28, 1923, page II-12] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>}}

In 1948 the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to "7 big picture magazines in beautiful [[rotogravure]] reproduction."<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=420191701&sid=42&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP Display advertisement, ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 13, 1947] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a ''Times'' advertisement on January 10, 1954.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=452716872&sid=39&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Bigger and Better Than Ever," page F-10] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

====Midsummer====

Between 1891 and 1895, the ''Times'' also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one with the theme "The Land and Its Fruits".<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=324708542&sid=18&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "'The Land and Its Fruits' — Our Harvest Number," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 5, 1891, page 6] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=324707802&sid=24&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Ready Tomorrow," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 4, 1891, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

===Zoned editions and subsidiaries===
{{main|Los Angeles Times suburban sections}}
In the 1990s, the ''Times'' published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included a [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] edition, an [[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]] edition, a [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] edition, and a "National Edition" that was distributed to [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The National Edition was closed in December 2004.

Some of these editions were folded into ''Our Times'', a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular Los Angeles ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]'' newspaper.

A subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the ''[[Burbank Leader]]'', ''Coastline Pilot'' of [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], ''Crescenta Valley Sun,'' ''Daily Pilot'' of [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] and [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]], ''[[Glendale News-Press]]'', ''[[Huntington Beach Independent]]'' and ''La Cañada Valley Sun''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/services/newspaper/mediacenter/la-mediacenter-factsheet-tcn2,0,1436442.story|title=''Los Angeles Times'' website|date=April 17, 2014|work=latimes.com|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Features==
Among the ''Times''{{'}} staff are columnists [[Steve Lopez]] and [[Patt Morrison]] and film critic [[Kenneth Turan]]. Sports columnists include [[Bill Plaschke]], who is also a panelist on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Around the Horn]]'', and [[Helene Elliott]], the first female sportswriter to be inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. Former sports editor [[Bill Dwyre]] is also a columnist.

One of the ''Times''{{'}} features is "Column One," a feature that appears daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it is a place for the weird and the interesting; in the ''How Far Can a Piano Fly?'' (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, [[Patt Morrison]] writes that the column's purpose is to elicit a "Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that" type of reaction.

The ''Times'' also embarked on a number of [[investigative journalism]] pieces. A series in December 2004 on the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Care Center|King/Drew Medical Center]] in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]], which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, ''[[The Soloist]].'' It also won 62 awards at the SND awards.

On January 31, 2013 a [[KCBS-TV]] news report looking at the use of disabled parking placards in Los Angeles, featured ''Times'' health columnist [[Karen Voight]] using a disabled parking badge, thereby avoiding meter parking charges outside the fitness centre where she was teaching a class.<ref>CBS2 Investigation reveals rampant-fraud in use of disabled parking placards: [http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/01/31/cbs2-investigation-reveals-rampant-fraud-in-use-of-disabled-parking-placards/]</ref> The crew filmed Voight participating in the exercise class, and subsequently walking down the street without any problem. When the CBS reporter David Goldstein confronted the international fitness expert, she said "My knee is unable to do a lot of things."

The Times-Mirror Company was a founding owner of television station [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which opened in January 1949. It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to [[CBS]] in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as [[Metromedia Square]], the studio was sold along with KTTV to [[Metromedia]] in 1963.

After a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated '''Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company''' with its 1970 purchase of the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' and its radio and television stations, [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD-AM]]-[[KZPS|FM]]-TV in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Storch|first=Charles|title=Times Mirror Selling Dallas Times Herald|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-06-27/business/8602150886_1_john-buzzetta-gloucester-county-times-dallas-times-herald|accessdate=June 26, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=June 27, 1986}}</ref> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted an exemption of its [[concentration of media ownership|cross-ownership]] policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed [[KDFW-TV]].

Times-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired [[KTBC-TV]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1973;<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/72-OCR/1972-09-04-BC-OCR-Page-0006.pdf "Johnson family sells Austin TV."] ''[[Broadcasting and Cable|Broadcasting]]'', September 4, 1972, pg. 6.</ref> and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by [[Advance Publications|Newhouse Newspapers]]: WAPI-TV (now [[WVTM-TV]]) in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; [[KTVI]] in [[St. Louis]]; WSYR-TV (now [[WSTM-TV]]) in [[Syracuse, New York]] and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now [[WETM-TV]]) in [[Elmira, New York]]; and WTPA-TV (now [[WHTM-TV]]) in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/80-OCR/1980-03-31-BC-OCR-Page-0030.pdf "Times Mirror's deal for Newhouse's TVs gets FCC approval."] ''Broadcasting'', March 31, 1980, pg. 30.</ref>  The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] areas, amongst others. They were originally titled '''Times-Mirror Cable''', and were later renamed to '''Dimension Cable Television'''. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] movie network; it wasn't successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to [[Cox Communications]].

Times-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/85-OCR/BC-1985-09-30-OCR-Page-0109.pdf "Changing hands: Proposed."] ''Broadcasting'', September 30, 1985, pg. 109.</ref> The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/93-OCR/BC-1993-03-22-OCR-Page-0007.pdf "Times Mirror set to sell four TV'."] ''Broadcasting and Cable'', March 22, 1993, pg. 7.</ref> These stations were acquired by [[New World Communications]] shortly thereafter and became key components in [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994–1995]].
