'''''I Am America (And So Can You!)''''' is a 2007 satirical book by American comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] and the writers of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. It was released on October 9, 2007, with the audiobook edition released several days earlier. The book is loosely structured around the fictional life story of [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] as he appears on ''The Colbert Report''. As of the April 6, 2008 publishing, the book had been on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]] in the Hardcover Nonfiction category for twenty-four weeks, ranking number one for fourteen of them.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/bestseller/ | title = ''New York Times'' Bestseller List |work=The New York Times | accessdate = April 2, 2008}}</ref>

==Description==
''I Am America (And So Can You!)'' is described as being a "pure extension" of ''The Colbert Report'', delving into the views of Colbert's "well-intentioned, poorly informed [[social status|high status]] idiot"<ref>{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Deborah | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25questions.html?_r=2&oref=slogin | title = Funny About the News |work=New York Times Magazine | date = September 25, 2005 | accessdate = January 5, 2008}}</ref> character on what he considers to be the most pressing issues facing the United States. The book draws some influence from the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s book, ''[[The O'Reilly Factor (book)|The O'Reilly Factor]]'' (2000) and [[Sean Hannity]]'s ''[[Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism|Deliver Us From Evil]]'' (2004), which Colbert says he forced himself to read as a reference.<ref>Colbert, Stephen (October 16, 2007).

Red [[Margin (typography)|margin]] notes appear throughout the book, providing humorous reactions and counterpoints to Colbert's arguments in a style comparable to the ''Report''{{'}}s "[[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report#The Wørd|The Wørd]]" segment.<ref>{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = It May Be a Book, but You Can Read It | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/books/08masl.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |work=The New York Times | date = October 8, 2007 | accessdate = January 5, 2008}}</ref> The cover features a sticker depicting a burning book, declaring ''I Am America'' to be a nominee for "The Stephen T. Colbert Award for the Literary Excellence". A sheet of twelve similar stickers are provided inside, with which readers are provided to nominate other books for the award. A second sheet of stickers containing positive expressions such as "Hell Yeah!", "Nailed It!" and "It's Morning In Colbert-ica" is included for readers as bookmarks to remind them "when you agreed with me most."<ref name="IAAASCY">Colbert, Stephen (2007).

Colbert, whose character frequently uses his show to advertise his own satirical products, frequently promoted ''I Am America'' at the time of its release, including in a commercial which depicted the book emerging from an erupting volcano in a manner similar to commercials for ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]''. On October 9, 2007, the day of the book's release, Colbert interviewed himself as the show's featured guest. On ''[[Meet the Press]]'', he signaled that his book was testing waters for a Presidential run, much like other politicians.{{episode|date=September 2012}}
