'''''Saturday Night Live''''' (abbreviated as '''''SNL''''') is an American late-night [[live television]] [[sketch comedy]] and [[variety show]] created by [[Lorne Michaels]] and developed by [[Dick Ebersol]]. The show premiered on [[NBC]] on October 11, 1975, under the original title '''''NBC's Saturday Night'''''. The show's [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches (listed chronologically)|comedy sketches]], which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening [[monologue]] and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a [[cold open]] sketch that ends with someone [[breaking character]] and proclaiming, "[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]," beginning the show proper.

In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by [[Jean Doumanian]], who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned; Michaels has remained since then. Many of ''SNL''{{'}}s cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, or starring in TV and film.

Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the [[GE Building|Comcast Building]], ''SNL'' has aired 787 episodes since its debut, and concluded its [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|fortieth season]] on May 16, 2015, making it one of the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest-running network television programs in the United States]]. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, including [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Brazil]] each meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as [[feature films]], although only two met with critical and financial success: ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980) and ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including [[List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases|home media releases]] of "best of" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.

Throughout four decades on air, ''Saturday Night Live'' has received a number of awards, including 36 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, two [[Peabody Award]]s, and three [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s. In 2000, it was inducted into the [[National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame]]. It was ranked tenth in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'s}} "[[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]]" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME''". As of 2012, it has received 156 Emmy nominations, the most received by any TV show. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests.

==Development== <!-- Short overview, with links to details available in other articles -->
{{History of SNL|float=left}}
From 1965 until September 1975, NBC ran ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Best of Carson]]'' reruns of ''The Tonight Show'', airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates' discretion (originally known as ''The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''). In 1974, [[Johnny Carson]] announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off.<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/history.shtml SNL's Beginnings] from [[NBC]]</ref>

In 1974, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, [[Dick Ebersol]], and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. At the suggestion of [[Paramount Pictures]] executive [[Barry Diller]], Schlosser and Ebersol then approached [[Lorne Michaels]]. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances. By 1975, Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[John Belushi]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Garrett Morris]], [[Laraine Newman]], [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[Gilda Radner]],<ref name="History2"/> and [[George Coe]].<ref name="LFNYch1"/> The show was originally called ''NBC's Saturday Night'', because ''Saturday Night Live'' was in use by ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' on the rival network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name="OriginalTitle"/> NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Debuting on October 11, 1975,<ref name="History1"/> the show became an instant hit, thrusting the cast into instant stardom. Chase left the show during the second season and was replaced by the new and upcoming comic [[Bill Murray]]. Aykroyd and Belushi left the show after season four. In 1980 (after season five), Michaels—emotionally and physically exhausted—requested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time to pursue other ideas.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=121-122}} Concerned that the show would be cancelled without him, Michaels suggested writers [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], and [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] as his replacements. However, NBC president [[Fred Silverman]] disliked Franken and—after Franken performed "Limo for a Lame-O", a scathing critique of Silverman's presidency—Silverman was furious at Franken and blamed Michaels for approving the sketch.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=157-159,161}} Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for [[Paramount Pictures]], intending to take his associate producer, [[Jean Doumanian]], with him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at ''SNL'' after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice-president Barbara Gallagher.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=160-161}} Michaels' departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=167}}

The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous $1 million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels' place.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=166, 176}} The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast's replacements, such as [[Charles Rocket]] and [[Ann Risley]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=167}} Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said "fuck" on live television.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=175}} After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=130}}<ref name="CrewDoumanian"/> Although executives suggested that ''SNL'' be left to die, network chief [[Brandon Tartikoff]] wanted to keep the show going, believing that the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol, who previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels' approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=177-179}}

Ebersol's tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era, except for the breakout of cast member [[Eddie Murphy]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=155}} Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Martin Short]] who could bring their already successful material to the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=177-179}} Ebersol's final year with this new cast is considered one of the series' funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show that Michaels had created.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=197}} After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, including departing from the show's established "live" format.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=200}} Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted not to. The show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol's idea, and seeking out established acts such as [[Joan Cusack]] and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=199}} The cast and writers struggled creatively, and in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer [[Bernie Brillstein]] to give it one more year.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=211}} The show was renewed but for the first time in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=212}} Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Phil Hartman]] instead of known names.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=212}}

The show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase ''SNL''{{'}}s ratings and profitability, then-NBC West Coast president [[Don Ohlmeyer]] and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as [[Chris Farley]] and [[Adam Sandler]] be fired because Ohlmeyer did not "get" them, and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels' position.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=352-353, 358}} Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for [[CBS]] during this time, but remained loyal to ''SNL''.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=350-351}} By 1995, Farley and Sandler were fired, and [[Mike Myers]], another popular cast member, had left for a film career, but a new cast waited to replace them, featuring the likes of [[Will Ferrell]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], and [[Tina Fey]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=359}} The show focused on performers, and writers were forced to supply material for the cast's existing characters before they could write original sketches.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=361-362}} By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels' independence, forcing the removal of writer [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] and cast member [[Norm MacDonald]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=363}}

===Cast===
[[File:SNL Original Cast.jpg|thumb|The original 1975 cast, from left to right: [[Laraine Newman]], [[John Belushi]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Garrett Morris]], and [[Chevy Chase]]]]
{{Main|Saturday Night Live cast members}}
The original 1975 cast of ''SNL'', officially known on-air as "The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players",<ref name="CastPTime"/> a term coined by writer [[Herb Sargent]],{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=38}} included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris and Chevy Chase. Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, he was hired on a one-year writer contract, and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=23}} Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=27}} Morris was initially brought in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=28}} Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=27}} Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner, and writers [[Anne Beatts]] and [[Michael O'Donoghue]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=26}} Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of trouble for the show, but Beatts, O'Donoghue and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=26}} After Chase left the show he was replaced by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, but was unable to due to budget restrictions.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=34}} When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=82-83}} Chase's departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House|Animal House]]'', and later refused to allow ''SNL'' musician [[Paul Shaffer]] to participate in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=81}}<ref name="CastHistory"/> Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent successes. Radner had a one-woman [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=118}} In 1980, when Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests, he was followed by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, and Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.<ref name="CastHistory"/>

The Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and were not received favorably.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=130}} Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Joe Piscopo]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=140}} Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]. Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian, however, also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=136-137}} Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=153}} after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's success.<ref name="Murphy1"/>{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=161-163,165}} Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Trading Places]]'', before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983–84 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Martin Short]] were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|pp=177-179}} Michaels' return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent such as Robert Downey Jr., [[Jon Lovitz]] and [[Dennis Miller]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=198}} The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller and [[Nora Dunn]], and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jan Hooks]], who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=209}} The cast continued on for the next decade with the addition of new talent such as [[Mike Myers]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[Chris Farley]]. Afraid of cast leaving for film, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing competition for limited screen time.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=308-309, 346-347}} By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=352-353,359}} While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of 6 cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like [[Bill Hader]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], and [[Fred Armisen]].<ref name="2013CastTransition"/>

''SNL'' has featured over 130 cast members including [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Spade]], [[Will Forte]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Chris Parnell]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Andy Samberg]], and [[Kristen Wiig]]. [[Darrell Hammond]] is the longest-serving cast member, having been a part of the cast for fourteen years between 1995 and 2009.<ref name="CastHammond"/> Those selected to join the cast of ''SNL'' are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as [[The Groundlings]] (Ferrell, Hartman,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=219}} Lovitz, Wiig<ref name="CastWiig1"/>) and [[The Second City]] (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,<ref name="FeySC"/> [[Tim Meadows]]), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, [[Norm Macdonald]]), who already possess the training or experience necessary for ''SNL''.<ref name="CastCasting"/>

Of the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of "Weekend Update", a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time.<ref name="CastUpdate1"/> Many of the "Weekend Update" hosts have gone on to find greater success outside of the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray,<ref name="CastUpdate1"/> Miller, Macdonald,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=286}} Fey,<ref name="CastUpdate1"/> Fallon,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=293}} and Poehler. From 2008, [[Seth Meyers]] was the solo host of "Weekend Update",<ref name="CastUpdate1"/> before being partnered with [[Cecily Strong]] in 2013. After Meyers left for ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'' in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer [[Colin Jost]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/snl-head-writer-join-cecily-strong-weekend-update-co-anchor-2D11981955|title='SNL' head writer to join Cecily Strong as 'Weekend Update' co-anchor

The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show,<ref name="CastContract2"/><ref name="CastContract"/> but starting with the 1999–2000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.<ref name="CastContract"/> The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed that a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on ''SNL'' and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, [[Paramount Pictures]], and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on ''SNL'' only to leave and make money for other studios.<ref name="CastContract"/> In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to ''SNL'' for a total of seven years.<ref name="CastContract3"/> The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=81}} In the first season of the show, cast were paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=78}} By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000<ref name="CastContract"/> and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year.

===Writers===
[[File:Lorne Michaels David Shankbone 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lorne Michaels]] in 2010]]
{{Main|List of Saturday Night Live writers}}
As of the 2013–14 season, [[Colin Jost]] and [[Rob Klein]] are the show's co-head writers. Meyers had been co-head writer since 2005 and became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012. The "Weekend Update" segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 2011–12 season.<ref name="2013SepCasting"/><ref name="AlexBaze1"/><ref name="WritersAbelesInt1"/> Scenes on "Weekend Update" that involve members of the cast acting in-character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside of the dedicated "Weekend Update" team, who know those characters better.<ref name="WritersAbelesInt1"/>

''SNL'' writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]], and [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]].<ref name="CastHistory"/> Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the ''SNL'' writing room. Like the ''SNL'' cast that step before the cameras, many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show such as Conan O'Brien, who was brought into ''SNL'' from The Groundlings, went on to writing for ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and eventually began hosting his own [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|show]],<ref name="speakerbio"/> and former head writer [[Adam McKay]] who, along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website [[Funny or Die]].<ref name="WriterMcKay"/> In 2000, Tina Fey became the first female ''SNL'' head writer<ref name="Levin2001"/><ref name="observer"/> and successfully transitioned into starring on the show,<ref name="witchel"/> as well as writing and starring in feature films,<ref name="Otto2004"/><ref name="Ebert2010"/><ref name="grosz"/> and ultimately creating and starring in her own show ''[[30 Rock]]''—partly based on her ''SNL'' experiences.<ref name="Poniewozik2006"/> In 2005, Fey was being paid $1.5 million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer.<ref name="WriterHeadSalary"/>

===Announcers===
[[Don Pardo]] served as the announcer for the series when it first began,<ref name="Announcer1"/> and continued in the role for all but season seven between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and [[Mel Brandt]] and [[Bill Hanrahan]] filled the announcing role. In 2004, Pardo announced that he would step down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 where he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 2009–10 season.<ref name="Announcer1"/> In 2010, then 92-year old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live.<ref name="Announcer1"/><ref name="2014Pardo"/> Cast members Joe Piscopo<ref>{{cite episode |title=Jamie Lee Curtis/The Fixx |series=Saturday Night Live |network=NBC |airdate=February 18, 1984}}</ref> and Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=295}} Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|season 40]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ausiello|first1=Michael|title=SNL Taps Darrell Hammond to Succeed Don Pardo as Announcer|url=http://tvline.com/2014/09/18/darrell-hammond-saturday-night-live-announcer-replacing-don-pardo-snl/|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>

===Hosts and musical guests===
{{Main|List of Saturday Night Live guests}}

A typical episode of ''SNL'' will feature a single host chosen for their popularity, novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=229}} The host delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical guest for the night. Comedian [[George Carlin]] was the first to host ''SNL'' in the debut October 1975 episode;<ref name="HostCarlin"/> three episodes later, [[Candice Bergen]] became the first female host{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=44}} and subsequently the first to host more than once.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=48}} Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, from actors, such as [[Christopher Walken]], [[Buck Henry]], and [[John Goodman]],{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=396}} to musicians like [[George Harrison]]{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=231}} and [[Dolly Parton]],{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=230}} to political activist [[Ralph Nader]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=229}} Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the [[Five-Timers Club]], a term that originated on a sketch performed on [[Tom Hanks]]' fifth episode.<ref name="Host5Timer"/> As of September 24, 2011, actor [[Alec Baldwin]] holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on sixteen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor [[Steve Martin]] who had hosted fifteen times since 1976.<ref name="HostBaldwinRec"/>

Each episode also features a musical guest, a solo act or a band, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. As of May 19, 2012, [[Dave Grohl]] is the most frequent musical guest, performing on eleven shows since 1992.<ref name="MusicalGrohl"/> Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip-synching tracks,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=45}} believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show. Exceptions are only made when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals, where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously.<ref name="60MinutesInterview"/> A 1975 performance by pop group [[ABBA]] was the first and only act to feature lip-synching,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=45}} until [[Saturday_Night_Live_incidents#Ashlee_Simpson|the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson]].

===The ''SNL'' Band===
{{Main|Saturday Night Live Band}}

The Saturday Night Live Band (also known as "The Live Band") is the [[house band]] for ''SNL''. Academy Award-winning composer [[Howard Shore]] served as the first musical director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] chorus) Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured several New York studio musicians including [[Paul Shaffer]] (1975–1980), [[Lou Marini]] (1975–1983), [[David Sanborn]] (1975), [[Michael Brecker]] (early 1980s), [[Ray Chew]] (1980–1983), [[Alan Rubin]] (1975–1983), [[Georg Wadenius]] (1979–1985), [[Steve Ferrone]] (1985), [[David Johansen]] (performing as Buster Poindexter), [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]] (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and [[G.E. Smith]] (musical director from 1985 to 1995). The band is currently under the leadership of [[Tower of Power]] alumnus [[Lenny Pickett]], keyboardist Leon Pendarvis and Eli Bruegemann, who does not play in the band on the live show. The number of musicians has varied over the years, but the basic instrumentation has been three saxophones, one trombone, one trumpet, and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards, a guitar, bass, drums, and an extra percussionist, not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo's arrival in 1995. The 1983–1984 and 1984–1985 seasons featured the smallest band, a six-piece combo. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a ''Saturday Night Live'' bumper graphic until the program resumes.<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/band.shtml SNL Band] from [[NBC]]</ref>

==Production==
[[File:29 - New York - Octobre 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[GE Building]] (30 Rockefeller Plaza, or "30 Rock") from where the show is broadcast.]]

===The studio===
Since the show's inception, ''SNL'' has aired from Studio 8H, located on floors 8 and 9 of the [[GE Building]] (30 Rockefeller Plaza, or "30 Rock"). The studio had previously been used as a radio [[soundstage]] for [[Arturo Toscanini]] and his [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]].{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally inspected Studio 8H in 1975, and found it technically limited, outdated, in need of repair,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=30}} and lacking the capacity to host a live show.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} at a cost of approximately $300,000.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=31}} Three of the first four shows of the 1976–77 season were shot at the former [[JC Studios|NBC Studios]] in Brooklyn, due to [[NBC News]] using Studio 8H for Presidential election coverage.<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/history.shtml SNL's Studio] from [[NBC]]</ref>

During the summer 2005 shooting hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first season premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in [[high-definition television]], appearing [[letterbox]]ed on conventional television screens.  The offices of ''SNL'' writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of "30 Rock".{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=35}}

===Creating an episode===
Production on an ''SNL'' episode will normally start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}}{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}}<ref name="SatNightDocu"/> between the cast, writers, producers including Michaels, and the guest host, in Michaels' office, over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}} a process which can extend through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8pm on the Tuesday evening.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}}<ref name="SatNightDocu"/> At 5pm on Wednesday, the sketches are read during a round-table meeting in the writers room,<ref name="SatNightDocu"/> attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=28}} At this point there may be at least 40 sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=28}}

After completion of the read-through, Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to Michaels' office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels' office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|pp=28-29}} Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day,{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}} but will certainly commence on Thursday, work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches,{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}} and possibly rehearsals.<ref name="SatNightDocu"/> If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=79}} before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8pm, again on Saturday before the live show.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}}<ref name="SatNightDocu"/> After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=30}} This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=27}} The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.{{Sfn|Mohr|2004|p=23}}

According to an interview with Fey in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated "Weekend Update" writing team will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of "Weekend Update" will normally not work with, or read the scripts from, the team until Thursday evening, after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.<ref>{{cite web

===Post-production===
With onsite facilities housed on floors 8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza, post-production duties on live broadcasts of ''Saturday Night Live'' include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganise for future repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from primarily [[analog recording|analog]] to [[Digital data|digital]] in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and 5 cameras worth of visual elements.<ref name="snlpostprodsan">{{cite web|url=http://www.qlogic.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Education_and_Resource/case_studies/SNL_v3.pdf |title=Case study.

===Filming and photography===
Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras, both using [[Vinten]] pedestals. A GVG 4000-3 digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a Chyron {{sic|hide=y|Infinit!}} character generator and a Quantel PictureBox. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analogue mixing console, and a Yamaha [[digital mixing console]] used for tape playback support and utility audio work.<ref name="nbcproduction8h">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcproductionservices.com/studio8H.stm |title=NBC Production Services |publisher=NBC Production Services |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref>

As of 2009, the opening title sequence and opening montage is shot using the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and [[Canon EOS 7D]] digital SLR cameras. Typical elements are recorded at 30&nbsp;[[frame rate|fps]], with slow-motion sequences shot at 60&nbsp;fps, both in full 1080p high definition.<ref name="snlpostprodcanon">{{cite web|url=http://www.shootonline.com/go/index.php?name=Release&op=view&id=rs-web2-1141654-1257971505-2 |title=NBC's Saturday Night Live shoots opening title sequence in full 1080p HD video with Canon's EOS digital SLR cameras | date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2009| publisher=[[Shoot]]}}</ref>

Edie Baskin was the original ''SNL'' photographer. She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and other work. Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=39}} The first episode used publicity photos of Carlin as transitional [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host [[Paul Simon]]. It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos, beginning a tradition which continues today.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=41}}

Since 1999, [[Mary Ellen Matthews]] has been the official photographer of ''SNL'', responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday.<ref name="MatthewsInt1"/> Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with [[soft light|hard lights]] to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: "I think it just helps the image pop off the screen...If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional...The [classic Hollywood lighting] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can."<ref name="MatthewsInt2"/> Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.<ref name="MatthewsInt2"/>

Germany's version of the show, ''RTL Samstag Nacht'' was a hit in the 1990s on the RTL channel.

Spain's version of the show was short-lived, only lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested.

The Japanese version ''Saturday Night Live JPN'', which ran for six months in 2011, was created in part with Lorne Michaels' production company, [[Coca-cola]], Broadway Video and broadcast on [[Fuji TV]] networks. The show followed the same format with a few minor differences, being only 45 minutes long and hosted by a permanent host. The cast was made up of seasoned comedians who take center stage and newcomers who play the background roles. It was broadcast once a month, and ended after six episodes, as planned from the start.<ref name="jezebel"/><ref name="mediaset1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2011/06/05/saturday-night-live-japan/ |title=SNL Japan |publisher=Axiommagazine.jp |date=June 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Megan|last=Angelo |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/japanese-snl-saturday-night-live-kristen-wiig-2011-6 |title=Saturday Night Live JPN |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=June 4, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2011/07/08/general/live-from-tokyo-its-saturday-night/#.VNOgKdLxKlB|title=Live from Tokyo, it’s Saturday Night!|publisher=japantimes.co.jp|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>

===Delays===
The episode scheduled for October 25, 1986, hosted by [[Rosanna Arquette]], was not aired until November 8 due to [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcasting Game 6 of the [[1986 World Series]] between the [[New York Mets]] and [[Boston Red Sox]]; the game entered extra innings, causing that night's broadcast of ''SNL'' to be cancelled. The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1:30&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, and broadcast two weeks later with an "apology" by Mets pitcher [[Ron Darling]]. (He explained that the Mets players had all been happy and excited to win the World Series game, widely considered one of the [[1986 World Series#Game 6|most memorable]] in the event's 109-year history, but of course they all had become upset and glum when, in the locker room afterwards, they found out that they had caused the first-ever cancellation of ''SNL''. Footage showed the depressed players sadly staring at the locker room floor in shame.){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The episode scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by [[Jennifer Lopez]], aired 45 minutes late due to an [[XFL]] game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay that the episode was re-run a mere three weeks later, and the fledgling league actually changed the rules in order to speed up play, Plus, a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off (whether the game had been decided or not) when SNL started so that no such incident would happen again.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1021846/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Fight Club | date=February 26, 2001}}</ref>

===Accolades===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Saturday Night Live}}

''Saturday Night Live'' has won numerous awards since its debut, including 36 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s,<ref name="emmysearchsnl">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Award Database |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> 2 [[Peabody Award]]s,<ref name="peabodywinnersbooksnl">{{cite web|url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/PeabodyWinnersBook.pdf|title=George Foster Peabody award winners|accessdate=November 23, 2009|publisher=National Association of Broadcasters}}</ref> and 4 [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s.<ref name="writersguildsnl">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/awards/awardssub.aspx?id=1517|title=Writers Guild Awards|accessdate=November 23, 2009|publisher=Writers Guild of America, West|archiveurl=http://archive.is/1fr9|archivedate=May 25, 2012}}</ref> In 2009, it received a total of 13 Emmy nominations for a lifetime total of 126, breaking the record for the most award nominated show in Emmy history, previously set with 124 by hospital drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.<ref name="AwardsRecordEmmy"/><ref name="AwardsRecordEmmy2"/> As of August 2012, it has received a record total of 156 Emmy nominations.<ref name="nbcabout"/><ref name="2012AccoAug"/> Only 17 cast members have received individual Emmy nominations in the show's entire history. Of these only Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner have won, taking the award for Outstanding Individual Performance, in 1976 and 1978 respectively. In 1983, Eddie Murphy became the last male cast member to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy until [[Bill Hader]] nearly thirty years later in 2012: Hader received a second nomination in 2013, making him the cast's only male multiple nominee.<ref name="2012AccoAug"/><ref name="2012AccoSep"/><ref name="2013AccoHader"/>

===Electoral impact===
''SNL'' has also had an effect on U.S. elections – most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called ''SNL'' Effect was observed during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on ''SNL'', with ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. [[Barack Obama]] was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the then-Democratic nominee.<ref name="ImpactGeneral"/>

Chevy Chase's bumbling impression of then-president [[Gerald Ford]] during the 1976 presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] stating "I can see Russia from my house" was actually spoken by SNL cast member Tina Fey while portraying Palin.<ref name="ImpactPalin"/> Several politicians have appeared on ''SNL'', including President [[Gerald Ford]] (in 1976, during the show's first season), Senator (at the time) Barack Obama (2007), Senator [[John McCain]] (2002 & 2008), Senator Hillary Clinton (2008), and Governor Sarah Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey's Palin impression, resulting in the show's largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers.<ref name="HostPoliticians"/><ref name="THRPolitical"/> Senator Obama's appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned her scheduled appearance.<ref name="THRPolitical"/>  The political content was abandoned briefly following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] terrorist attack in New York, with Poehler saying that the writers did not want to produce politicized material; highly political content would be absent for the next 4 years.<ref name="THRPolitical"/>

==Controversies==
{{main|Saturday Night Live incidents}}
Due to the show's [[live television|live factor]], a number of technical problems, performer mishaps, and even random cuts to [[dead air]] have occurred throughout the show's run.

==In other media==

===Home media===
{{Main|List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases}}
Currently, [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] hold video rights to the series. Universal has issued complete season DVD sets of the first few seasons, while Lionsgate's share of the rights are a result of prior contracts with NBC struck before the [[NBC Universal]] merger. A majority of Lionsgate's SNL DVDs are "Best Of..." compilations.

===Books===
''Saturday Night Live'' (ISBN 0-380-01801-2), the first authorized book about the series, was published by [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1977 and edited by [[Anne Beatts]] and [[John Head]],{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2014}} with photography by Edie Baskin;<ref>[http://lccn.loc.gov/78102562 ''Saturday Night Live'' (1977)] from the [[Library of Congress]] Online Catalog</ref> all three worked for ''SNL'' at the time the book was published. The oversized illustrated paperback included the scripts for several sketches by the 1975–1980 cast.<ref>[http://www.dailyllama.com/spam/books/idle.html Eric Idle Books] from dailyllama.com</ref> In 1986, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad authored ''Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live'' (ISBN 0-688-05099-9), a behind-the-scenes look at the first ten seasons. ''Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years'' (ISBN 0-395-75284-1), by Michael Cader, was released in 1994, and presented information about the cast, characters, and other memorable moments seen on the show from 1975 to 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Book Review: 'Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years'. |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303994,00.html|accessdate=April 30, 2011| work=Entertainment Weekly| first1=Bruce |last1=Fretts |date=October 7, 1994}}</ref>

''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests'' (ISBN 0-316-73565-5) was released in 2002. The book, written by [[Tom Shales]] and James Andrew Miller, consists of interviews from people who have worked on the show. The interviews reveal personal experiences from what happened backstage and the difficulty of getting the show on air each week.<ref>{{cite news|title=Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, Definitive record of an enduring creative work|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/bookreviews/50.html|accessdate=April 30, 2011| work=Washingtonian| first1=William |last1=O'Sullivan | date=January 4, 2003}}</ref> In 2004, former cast member [[Jay Mohr]] released his memoir ''[[Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live]]'' (ISBN 1-401-30801-5), about his struggles during his two seasons on the show between 1993 and 1995, dealing with getting sketches on air and the intense work schedule. Cast member Bobby Moynihan described the book as "a handbook on what NOT to do at ''SNL''."<ref name="BookMohr1"/>

===Films===
''SNL'' has made several efforts to develop some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which earned over $115 million on a $27 million budget.<ref name="BOMBlues"/>

In 1990, Michaels oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled ''The Saturday Night Live Movie'' with many of the show's current writing staff, including [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], [[Greg Daniels]], [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Robert Smigel]], and [[George Meyer]], contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990 before being abandoned.<ref>[http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2012/07/06/script-review-the-saturday-night-live-movie/ Script Review: THE SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE MOVIE] from filmbuffonline.com</ref>

However, it was the success of ''Wayne's World'' (1992) that encouraged Michaels to produce more film [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, based on several popular sketch characters. Michaels revived 1970s characters for ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (1993), followed by ''[[It's Pat]]'' (1994); ''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]'' (1995); ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'' (1998); ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Ladies Man (2000 film)|The Ladies Man]]'' (2000). Some did moderately well, though others did not—notably, ''It's Pat'', which did so badly at the box office that the studio that made the film, [[Touchstone Pictures]] (owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], which also owns NBC's rival [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), pulled it only one week after releasing it,<ref>[http://www.filmcritic.com/features/2010/05/snls-bad-boys----top-ten-worst-snlmovies/ Live, From New York, It's the Worst Movies From the Cast of SNL] from filmcritic.com</ref> and ''Stuart Saves His Family'', which lost $14 million. Many of these films were produced by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The films based on ''The Blues Brothers'' were produced by [[Universal Studios]], which merged with NBC in 2004 to form [[NBC Universal]] (Universal also has a [[United International Pictures|joint venture]] with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios' films).

The character Bob Roberts from the [[Tim Robbins]] [[Bob Roberts|film of the same name]] (1992), first appeared on ''SNL'' in a short film about the conservative folk singer.

In addition, the 1999 comedy film ''[[Office Space]]'' originated from a series of animated short films by [[Mike Judge]] that aired on ''SNL'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite news | last = Fierman | first = Daniel | title = Judge's Dread | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = February 26, 1999 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274497,00.html | accessdate = August 16, 2007}}</ref>

The group [[The Folksmen]] first appeared on ''SNL'', performing the song "Old Joe's Place" before later appearing in the film ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians: [[Harry Shearer]], [[Michael McKean]], and [[Christopher Guest]], who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]. At the time of the appearance (the 1984–85 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members.

''[[Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures]]'' is based off the [[Mr. Bill]] sketches from early seasons of ''SNL''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091565/ |title=Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures (1986) - IMDb |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=IMDb |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Rosenberg |title=The First Arrivals on the Home Front |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58024463.html?dids=58024463:58024463&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+10%2C+1986&author=HOWARD+ROSENBERG&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=THE+FIRST+ARRIVALS+ON+THE+HOME+FRONT&pqatl=google |work=Los Angeles Times |page=1, Calendar section |date=September 10, 1986 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>

===Music===
In 2005, the comedy troupe [[The Lonely Island]], consisting of ''SNL'' members [[Andy Samberg]], [[Akiva Schaffer]], and [[Jorma Taccone]], gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their skit music video "[[Lazy Sunday]]", written with fellow cast member [[Chris Parnell]]. The song became a surprise hit,<ref name="LonelyIsland1"/> and convinced Michaels to encourage the troupe to develop more comedy songs. Further successes with songs including "[[Like A Boss]], "[[Jizz in My Pants]]," "[[I'm on a Boat]]," "[[We Like Sportz]]", "Boombox," and "[[Dick in a Box]]"—which won an Emmy for ''Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics'' in 2007<ref name="LonelyIsland2"/>—saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, ''[[Incredibad]]'' (2009)<ref name="LonelyIsland3"/> and ''[[Turtleneck & Chain]]'' (2011), containing ''SNL''-developed songs and original works. The albums were released by [[Universal Republic Records]] who were provided with a license to the ''SNL'' songs by NBC and Broadway Video.

A cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including the song "Chevy's Girls"
and comedy bits from the show ("Weekend Update", "Emily Litella", "Gun Control"); it was later re-issued on CD and [[MP3]] download.

===Other===
Several programs have documented the behind-the-scenes events of the show. A ''60 Minutes'' report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted the involvement of the guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an [[A&E Network|A&E]] episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' which covered the production process, as well as an episode of ''TV Tales'' in 2002 on [[E!]]. In 2010, ''Saturday Night'', a 94-minute documentary by actor [[James Franco]] in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by [[John Malkovich]], from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated as a five-minute short film for Franco's [[New York University]] film class, Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to be expanded.<ref name="SatNightDocu"/> On Feb. 15, 2015, NBC aired a 3 1/2 hour special on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members and special guest appearances from previous hosts.<ref>http://variety.com/2015/tv/reviews/snl-40-tv-review-saturday-night-live-40th-anniversary-special-1201434680/</ref>

In September 2011, ice cream company [[Ben & Jerry's]] released a limited-edition ice cream called "[[Schweddy Balls]]", inspired by a 1998 sketch of the same name starring Alec Baldwin, [[Ana Gasteyer]] and [[Molly Shannon]].<ref name="MerchIceCream3"/> The ice cream became the fastest-selling Ben & Jerry's limited-edition flavor. The ice cream was also subject to criticism and boycotts by the [[American Family Association#One Million Moms/One Million Dads project|One Million Moms]] organization over the "vulgar"<ref name="MerchIceCream2"/> name. Some retail chains chose not to sell the flavor, but declined to say if the decision was at their own discretion or based on the One Million Moms boycotts.<ref name="MerchIceCream2"/><ref name="MerchIceCream"/> In June 2014, two new flavours inspired by SNL sketches were introduced—''[[Lazy Sunday]]'', based on a sketch of the same name featuring Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell, and ''Gilly's Catastrophic Crunch'' based on the recurring ''[[Gilly (Saturday Night Live)#Gilly|Gilly]]'' sketches featuring Kristen Wiig.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kludt |first=Amanda |url=http://eater.com/archives/2014/06/19/saturday-night-live-inspired-ben-jerrys-newest-flavors.php |title=Ben & Jerry's Introduces SNL-Themed Ice Cream |publisher=Eater |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2014-12-12}}</ref> ''Two Wild and Crazy Pies'', based on the catchphrase of the recurring [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1977–1978#The Festrunk Brothers ("Two Wild and Crazy Guys!")|Festrunk Brothers]], was introduced in September 2014,<ref>{{cite web|last=Aiken |first=Kristen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/24/ben-and-jerrys-new-snl-flavor_n_5864158.html |title=Ben & Jerry's New 'SNL'-Inspired Flavor Is Their Best Yet, But You Won't Find It In A Pint |work=The Huffington Post |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2015-02-16}}</ref> followed by ''Wayne'Swirled'' inspired by the eponymous [[Wayne's World]] in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/wayneswirled-snl-batch |title=Introducing Wayne'Swirled: The Newest SNL Batch! |publisher=Ben & Jerry |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2015-02-16}}</ref>
