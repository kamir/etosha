'''Thomas Kenton "Kent" Jones''' (born June 12, 1964) is a writer and performer on MSNBC's ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]''. He is a comedy writer who also wrote and performed at [[Air America Radio]].

== Career ==

A [[Missouri]] native, Kent moved to [[New York]] in 1986 and held a variety of [[journalism]] jobs working at ''[[InStyle]]'' and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and contributing freelance humor articles to various publications. In 1996, he discovered the 'far more legitimate field of fake news' at ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]], where he was a writer for five years. In 2000, Kent and his fellow writers won the [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy, Variety or Special, as well as the [[Peabody Award]] for Excellence in Broadcasting.  Kent then moved to [[Los Angeles]] and worked as a producer on shows at [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2004 Kent moved back to New York to become part of the launch of [[Air America Radio]]. He wrote for ''[[Unfiltered]]'' with [[Lizz Winstead]], [[Chuck D]] and [[Rachel Maddow]] where he delivered the "Unfiltered News." He also wrote extensively for ''[[Morning Sedition]]'' where he performed several characters including Foreign Correspondent Angus McFarquhar, Bill from Harlem and, most frequently, Planet Bush Bureau Chief Lawton Smalls. After the cancellation of ''Morning Sedition'' in December 2005, Kent continued to write and perform on ''[[The Marc Maron Show]]''  until its cancellation in July 2006.  He appeared on ''The Rachel Maddow Show'', with daily Sports and "Kent Jones Now" segments and additional co-hosting, especially during her "Ask Dr. Maddow" and "Pet Story" segments.  The Lawton Smalls character made "calls" to ''[[The Majority Report|The Sam Seder Show]]'' and was on the Nov 7th 2006 live webcam election coverage with Rachel Maddow. Jones left Air America on Friday, December 14, 2007, as a result of a "business decision" by the management.

He uses the phrase Sacajawea! When something shocks and surprises him.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Jones became a regular contributor to ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' on MSNBC in September 2008. His regular segment "Just Enough" aired for several years during the last few minutes of the show and focused on pop culture news, before being quietly dropped.  He now serves as a producer for the show, appearing occasionally on air as correspondent and in other segments. He also contributes humor pieces to the show's blog, [http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/ The Maddowblog].

The show and its entire staff won an [http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/30/8041459-backstage-at-the-emmy-awards-and-completely-out-of-our-element?lite Emmy] award in 2011 for Outstanding news and discussion analysis.

== Personal ==

Kent lives in New York City with his wife, Kelly.

He has also joked that he is the four-time winner of the [[Iditarod (race)|Iditarod sled race]] in Alaska, though he disclaimed this on the March 16, 2007 ''Rachel Maddow Show'', referencing the Wikipedia entry in the process ("It's false.  It's ''funny'', but it's wrong.")

He is a [[Kansas City Royals]] fan.
