At Harvard, Lemmon was a member of the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], and he was commissioned by the [[United States Navy]],<ref name=tca/> serving as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on an aircraft carrier briefly before returning to Harvard after the end of his military service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Lemmon Biography Film Actor (1925–2001)|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jack-lemmon-9378762|website=Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref> After graduation in 1947,<ref>{{cite web|title=Actor Jack Lemmon Honored by Glee Club, Hasty Pudding|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/12.12/ActorJackLemmon.html|website=Harvard University Gazette|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref> Lemmon took up acting professionally, working on radio, television and Broadway.<ref name=tca/> He studied acting under coach [[Uta Hagen]].<ref name=tca/> He was enamored of the piano and learned to play it on his own. He could also play the harmonica, guitar, organ, and the [[double bass]].

==Career==
Lemmon's film debut was a [[bit part]] as a plasterer/painter in the 1949 film ''[[The Lady Takes a Sailor]]'', but he went unnoticed until his debut, opposite [[Judy Holliday]], in the 1954 comedy ''[[It Should Happen to You]]''.<ref name=tca/> Lemmon worked with legendary actresses, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Betty Grable]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Doris Day]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Judy Holliday]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[June Allyson]], [[Virna Lisi]], [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Sophia Loren]]. He was close friends with actors, [[Tony Curtis]], [[Ernie Kovacs]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Kevin Spacey]]. He made two films with Curtis, three films with Kovacs (''[[Operation Mad Ball]]'', ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'' and ''[[It Happened to Jane]]'') and eleven with Matthau.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Early in Lemmon's career he met comedian [[Ernie Kovacs]] while co-starring with him in ''[[Operation Mad Ball]]''.<ref name="imdb.com">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050805/ IMDB entry for ''Operation Mad Ball'']</ref> Lemmon and Kovacs became close friends and appeared together in two subsequent films, ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]''<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051406/ IMDB entry ''Bell, Book, and Candle'']</ref> and ''[[It Happened to Jane]]''<ref name="ReferenceB">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052933/ IMDB entry for ''It Happened to Jane'']</ref> In 1977 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] broadcast a compilation series of Kovacs's television work, and Lemmon served as the narrator of the series.  Lemmon discussed his friendship with Kovacs in the documentary, ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083898/ IMDB entry for ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius'']</ref>

He was a favorite of director [[Billy Wilder]], starring in the films ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (for which he was awarded [[Prix d'interprétation masculine|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]), ''[[The Apartment]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'', ''[[Avanti!]]'', ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'', and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]''.  Wilder felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography ''Nobody's Perfect'' quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat". The biography quotes Lemmon as saying, "I am particularly susceptible to the parts I play... If my character was having a nervous breakdown, I started to have one".

He enjoyed a longtime working relationships with both [[Blake Edwards]], starring in  ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962), ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) and ''[[That's Life! (film)|That's Life!]]'' (1986), and [[Richard Quine]], starring in ''[[My Sister Eileen (1955 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'', ''[[Operation Mad Ball]]''.,<ref name="imdb.com"/> ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]''<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and ''[[It Happened to Jane]]''<ref name="ReferenceB"/> and ''[[How to Murder Your Wife]]'' (1965). Quine also directed Lemmon's screen test when the actor was signed by Columbia.

Lemmon recorded an album in 1958 while filming ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Twelve jazz tracks were created for Lemmon and another twelve were added. Lemmon played the piano and recorded his own renditions of Monroe's trademark songs, ''I Wanna Be Loved By You'' and ''I'm Through With Love'', for the album which was released in 1959 as ''A Twist of Lemmon/Some Like It Hot''.

Lemmon was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor Oscar]] in 1956 for ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (1955) and the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (1973), becoming the first actor to achieve this rare double (the only other actors to achieve this are: [[Robert De Niro]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[Denzel Washington]]).<ref name=tca/> He was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in the controversial film ''[[Missing (film)|Missing]]'' in 1982, and for his roles in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962),  ''[[The China Syndrome]] '' (1979), and ''[[Tribute (1980 film)|Tribute]]'' (1980). He won another Cannes award for his performance in ''Missing'' (which received the [[Palme d'Or]]). In 1988, the [[American Film Institute]] gave him its [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]].

''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962) was a favorite role. He portrayed Joe Clay, a young, fun-loving alcoholic businessman. In that film, Lemmon delivered the line, "My name is Joe Clay ... I'm an alcoholic." Three and a half decades later, he stated on the television program ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' that he was a recovering alcoholic.<ref name=tca/>

Lemmon's production company JML produced ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' in 1967.  [[Paul Newman]] was grateful to Lemmon for his support and offered him the role of the Sundance Kid, later played by [[Robert Redford]] in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', but Lemmon turned it down.  He did not like riding horses and he felt he'd already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid's character before.<ref>''A slice of Lemmon for extra character'', Bob Flynn, Panorama, p. 7, Canberra Times, August 15, 1998</ref>

Lemmon appeared in many films partnered with actor [[Walter Matthau]]. Among their pairings was 1968's ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'', as [[Felix Ungar]] (Lemmon) and [[Oscar Madison]] (Matthau). The first film they starred in together was ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (for which Matthau won the 1966 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]''. In 1971, Lemmon directed Matthau in the comedy ''[[Kotch]]''. It was the only movie that Lemmon directed and Matthau was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance.

Additionally, Lemmon and Matthau had small parts in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (the only film in which both appeared without sharing screen time). In 1993, the duo teamed again to star in ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]''. The film was a surprise hit, earning the two actors a new generation of young fans.  During the rest of the decade, they would star together in ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]'', ''[[Out to Sea]]'', and the widely panned ''[[The Odd Couple II]]''. In 1996, Lemmon was awarded the [[Golden Bear|Honorary Golden Bear]] award at the [[46th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale1996">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html |title=Berlinale: 1996 Prize Winners |accessdate=January 1, 2012 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> In 1997, Lemmon was a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]," playing the character Frank Ormand, owner of the pretzel business that Marge Simpson franchised. The recurring character [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Gil Gunderson|Old Gil Gunderson]], voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], is an ongoing parody of Lemmon's character in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''.

At the [[55th Golden Globe Awards|1998 Golden Globe Awards]], he was nominated for "Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie" for his role in ''[[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' losing to [[Ving Rhames]].  After accepting the award, Rhames asked Lemmon to come on stage and, in a move that stunned the audience, gave his award to him. (The [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]], which presents the Golden Globes, had a second award made and sent to Rhames.).<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Tk3EgDPZD0w# Ving Rhames gives his Golden Globe to Jack Lemmon (1998)]</ref> He received the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1988.

Lemmon won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie (film)|Tuesdays with Morrie]]''. His final film role was an uncredited one: the narrator in [[Robert Redford]]'s film ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Jack Lemmon 1988 ArM.jpg|thumb|Lemmon in 1988]]
Actor [[Kevin Spacey]] recalled that Lemmon is remembered for always making time for other people. Already regarded as a legend, he met teenage Spacey backstage after a theater performance and spoke to him about pursuing an acting career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=Drnz1mbpui4 |title=Charlie Rose – Kevin Spacey / Jamaica Kincaid |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}</ref> Spacey would later work with Lemmon in ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1987), ''[[Dad (film)|Dad]]'' (1989), the critically acclaimed film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992) and on stage in a revival of ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]''. Lemmon was Spacey's [[mentor]], and taught Spacey that people who do well in a business have an obligation to "send the elevator back down" to help lift people starting out on the ground floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQkTeZQnw4&t=32s |title=Jameson First Shot |publisher=YouTube |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> This metaphor is fitting given that Lemmon was born in an elevator.

In his autobiography, ''My Life'',<ref>Reynolds, Burt. (1994) My Life. New York: Hyperion. ISBN 0-7868-6130-4</ref> [[Burt Reynolds]] recalls Lemmon as the quintessential gentleman who never spoke ill of anyone, even if they deserved it. This kindness backfired for Reynolds: prior to accepting the lead in ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]'' (1975), directed by [[John G. Avildsen]], Reynolds asked Lemmon, whom Avildsen had directed in ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (1973) for an opinion of Avildsen as a director. Lemmon told Reynolds that Avildsen was "okay", and Reynolds accepted the role. After the film was released and his experiences in production proved unhappy, Reynolds complained to Lemmon and described Avildsen as an "asshole", whereupon Lemmon replied, "I guess you could say that."

Lemmon was married twice. His son [[Chris Lemmon]] (born 1954), was his first child by his first wife, actress [[Cynthia Stone]]. His second wife was actress [[Felicia Farr]], with whom he had a daughter, Courtney (born 1966). Farr had a daughter from a previous relationship (her marriage to Lee Farr) named Denise. Lemmon was a [[Catholic]].<ref>Don Widener ''Lemmon: A Biography'' (1975), page 7</ref> He publicly announced his alcoholism during a 1998 interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/29/entertainment/la-et-st-james-lipton-20130529|title=James Lipton's 'Inside the Actors Studio' hits 250 on changing Bravo|author=Meredith Blake|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611264/|title=Inside the Actors Studio: Season 4, Episode 10|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref>

To golfers everywhere Lemmon was known as the "star" of the celebrity-packed third round telecast of the annual Bing Crosby National Pro-Am/AT&T National Pro Am, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links each February.  Lemmon's packed gallery was there not only for his humor but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to "make the cut" to round 4, something he was not able to achieve.

==Death==
[[File:Jack Lemmon grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Jack Lemmon's grave]]
Lemmon died of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] and [[metastasis|metastatic cancer]] of the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] on June 27, 2001.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Aljean Harmetz]] |coauthors= |title=Jack Lemmon, Dark and Comic Actor, Dies at 76 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/movies/jack-lemmon-dark-and-comic-actor-dies-at-76.html |quote=Jack Lemmon, the brash young American Everyman who evolved into the screen's grumpiest old Everyman during a movie career that lasted a half century, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles.
