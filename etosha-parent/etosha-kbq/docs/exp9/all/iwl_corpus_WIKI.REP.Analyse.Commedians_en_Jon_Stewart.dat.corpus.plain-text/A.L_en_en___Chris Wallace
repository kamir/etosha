Wallace attended [[The Hotchkiss School]] and [[Harvard College]]. He first reported news on-air for [[WHRB]], the student radio station at Harvard. He memorably covered the 1969 occupation of University Hall by students and was detained by [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] police, using his one phone call to sign off a report from Cambridge City Jail.<ref>{{cite news|last=Levinson|first=Arlene|title=Harvard Alumni Plan Reunion To Mark Shutting Down University in 1969|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=15 March 1989}}</ref>

Although accepted at [[Yale Law School]], Wallace instead took a job with ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Jonathan|title=Son of '60 Minutes' icon makes his own mark at Fox News|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=The Hill|date=14 July 2005|page=19}}</ref>  He says he realized he wanted to move to television when he noticed all the reporters at the 1972 [[political convention]]s were watching the proceedings on TV instead of in person. For a time in the early 1970s, he worked for Chicago CBS owned-and-operated station [[WBBM-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Anonymous |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/cambridge/news/x1060311846/Harvards-WHRB-celebrates-70-years |title=Harvard's WHRB celebrates 70 years – Cambridge, Massachusetts – Cambridge Chronicle |publisher=Wickedlocal.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>

==Network and cable television journalist==

Wallace began his network journalism career with [[NBC]] in 1975, where he stayed for 14 years, as a reporter with [[WNBC-TV]] in [[New York City]]. Wallace then transferred to NBC's Washington bureau as a political correspondent for [[NBC News]], and later served as Washington co-anchor for the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show in 1982. He also served as chief [[White House]] correspondent (1982–89), moderator of ''[[Meet the Press]]'' (1987–88), and anchor of the Sunday edition of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''. Wallace's confrontational style was evident during President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s news conference in March 1987, when Reagan admitted to [[Iran-Contra|dealing arms for hostages]]. During his questioning, Wallace asked Reagan why he had denied that Israel was involved with the arms sales to Iran "when you knew that wasn't true."<ref>{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|last2=Beckwith|first2=David|last3=Gorey|first3=Hays|title=Reagan: Well, He Survived|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963910-2,00.html|accessdate=1 September 2010|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 30, 1987}}</ref>

Wallace left NBC in 1989 for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. At [[ABC News]], Wallace was the senior correspondent for ''[[Primetime (TV series)|Primetime Thursday]]'' and occasionally hosted ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. During the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991, he reported from [[Tel Aviv]] on the [[Iraq]]i [[Scud]] missiles attacks. At the time, the [[Israeli Government]] did not want to advertise where the Scuds landed, in order to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of ''Nightline'', Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. ''Nightline'' host [[Ted Koppel]] cut him off, and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richmond|first=Ray|title=Networks wary of broadcasting military secrets|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=The Orange County Register|date=20 January 1991|page=A05}}</ref>

After another 14 years at ABC, Wallace left in 2003 to join the [[Fox News Channel]]. He has remarked in the past that his work at Fox opened his eyes to what critics cite as [[media bias|bias in the mainstream press]]. Wallace has stated, "Fox News wouldn't exist if it weren't for this kind of stuff going on in the mainstream media. That's why people are fed up with that and want the antidote to it because they get it and they've gotten it for years – the so-called bias in the [[journalistic objectivity|objective press]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/10/16/80900.shtml |title=Chris Wallace: Media Bias 'Astonishing' |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2005-10-16 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> Wallace began hosting ''[[Fox News Sunday]] with Chris Wallace'' in 2003 after replacing [[Tony Snow]] and is an occasional guest on the [[Howie Carr]] show on [[Boston]]'s WRKO.

== Personal life ==
Despite Wallace's blood relationship with his father [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike]], his stepfather  [[Bill Leonard (journalist)|Bill Leonard]] had far more of an impact.

== Political affiliation ==
On October 11, 2006, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that Wallace had been a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for more than two decades. Wallace explained his party affiliation in terms of [[pragmatism]], insisting that being a Democrat is the only feasible means of participating in the political process in heavily Democratic Washington, D.C. He maintained he had voted for candidates from both major parties in the past.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Argetsinger |first=Amy |title=Chris Wallace, Card-Carrying Democrat? |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001509.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2006-10-11 |accessdate=2008-11-05 }}</ref>
