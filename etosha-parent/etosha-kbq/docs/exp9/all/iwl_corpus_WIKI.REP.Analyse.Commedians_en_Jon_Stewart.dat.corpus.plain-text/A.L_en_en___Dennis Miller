'''Dennis Miller''' (born November 3, 1953) is an American [[stand-up comedian]], [[talk show host]], [[political commentator]], [[sports commentator]], [[actor]], television personality,  and radio personality.

He rose to fame as a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1985, and subsequently hosted a string of his own [[talk show]]s on [[HBO]], [[CNBC]] and in syndication. From 2007 to 2015, Miller hosted a daily, three-hour, self-titled talk radio program, nationally syndicated by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]].<ref name=radioinsight/> He is known for his critical assessments of current events, laced with pop culture references and delivered in an idiosyncratic verbal style.

He is listed as 21st on [[Comedy Central]]'s 100 greatest stand up comedians of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time|publisher=Listology.com|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> and was ranked as the best host of SNL's ''[[Weekend Update]]'' by [[Vulture.com]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Vulture.com]]|date=May 17, 2014|title=A Complete Ranking of Saturday Night Live ‘Weekend Update’ Anchors|first=Dan|last=Reilly|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/04/snl-weekend-update-anchors-ranking.html}}</ref>

==Early life==
Miller was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in [[Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania|Castle Shannon]], a suburb of Pittsburgh, where he graduated from [[Keystone Oaks High School]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/weekend/people/people-wood020202.shtml |title=People: Peter Wood on Dennis Miller on NRO Weekend |publisher=Nationalreview.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> His parents separated and Miller was raised by his mother, Norma, a [[dietitian]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Chuck|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63732934.html |title=1ST PERSON: Meet Dennis Miller  |date=July 27, 2000 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports_headlines/20000730miller4.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Dennis Miller: Monday Night Live | first1=Chuck | last1=Finder | date=July 30, 2000}}</ref> Miller is of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name="washington">{{cite video| people = Miller, Dennis| title = Live from Washington, D.C. – They Shoot HBO Specials, Don't They?| medium = TV| publisher = [[HBO]]|date = 1994-04-20}}</ref> His two earliest childhood comedy heroes were [[Jonathan Winters]] and [[Tim Conway]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Miller |first= Dennis |interviewer= Dennis Miller |title= The Dennis Miller Show |last2= Conway |first2= Tim |url= http://www.dennismillerradio.com/blog?action=blogArchive&blogTag=Tim%20Conway |date= 2013-11-01 }}</ref>  During college, he was a member of [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] Fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baylorsigtau.com/page.php?page_id=4056 |title=Welcome to Sigma Tau Gamma, Gamma Omega Chapter |publisher=Baylorsigtau.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> About his social status during this period, Miller writes: "When I went to college, I lived on campus, and the guys I hung out with made me do some things I'm not proud of, although they made the characters in ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' look like the [[Rat Pack]] in 1962. I myself made that kid [[Curtis Armstrong|Booger]] look like [[Remington Steele]]" (''I Rant, Therefore I Am''). Miller graduated from [[Point Park University]] in 1976 with a degree in [[journalism]].<ref name="TVG bio">{{cite web|title=Dennis Miller Biography|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dennis-miller/bio/147096|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports_headlines/20000730miller4.asp |title=Dennis Miller: Monday Night Live |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2000-07-30 |accessdate=2010-07-10 | first1=Chuck | last1=Finder}}</ref>

In 1979 Miller won $500 as a runner-up in ''Playboy''<nowiki/><nowiki>'s first annual humor competition with the following joke:</nowiki><ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1979|title=Funny Money|magazine=Playboy|volume=26|number=6|issn=0032-1478}}</ref>

{{quote|The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.|Dennis Miller|Playboy, June 1979}}

==Television career==
In the early 1980s, Miller hosted ''Punch Line'', a Saturday afternoon [[newsmagazine]] for teenagers, on Pittsburgh's [[KDKA-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile |publisher=Comedy-zone.net |accessdate=2010-10-07}}{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> He also produced humorous essays for the syndicated ''[[Evening Magazine]]'' television program. Miller then began performing stand-up in [[New York City|New York]] comedy clubs such as [[Catch A Rising Star]] and The Comic Strip, as well as in Los Angeles at [[The Comedy Store]]. He appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'', where he lost out to fellow comedian [[Sinbad (actor)|Sinbad]] after the two tied with judges' scores, but Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SNLDennisMiller.gif|thumb|left|Miller on [[Weekend Update]]]] -->
Miller's big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by [[Lorne Michaels]] at [[The Comedy Store]]. He landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he succeeded [[Christopher Guest]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic [[Jon Lovitz]], but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the ''Update'' segment to do costume changes; so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name="penn">{{cite episode|title=Penn Jillette Radio Show. Special Guest: Dennis Miller |url=http://www.pennfans.net/view/Audio_Archive/PennRadio/Penn.Jillette.Radio.Show.2006.09.22/| series=[[Penn Radio]] |airdate=2006-09-22}}</ref> Miller began his fictional news reports with "Good evening, and what can I tell you?" and closed with "Guess what, folks?  That's the news, and I am outta here!" Fans of ''SNL'' became accustomed to his smirky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by [[Dana Carvey]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]], all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left ''SNL'' in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to [[Kevin Nealon]].

In 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, ''The Off-White Album'', derived from an [[HBO]] special titled ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0249466|Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[metaphor]]-driven style he was known for on ''Saturday Night Live'', and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, ''Dennis Miller: Black and White'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0317340|Dennis Miller: Black and White (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.

Although Miller spent much of his time on ''SNL'' behind the ''Weekend Update'' desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name="snl archives">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>

====Recurring characters====
* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch "Miss Connie's Fable Nook"
* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include [[Jon Lovitz]] as Bob, [[Damon Wayans]] as Keith, and [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul)

====Celebrity impersonations====
* [[Gary Hart]]
* [[George Harrison]]
* [[Nathaniel Crosby]]

===''The Dennis Miller Show''===
In 1992, following his departure from ''Saturday Night Live'', Miller launched a late-night TV talk show, ''The Dennis Miller Show'', syndicated by [[Tribune Entertainment]]. ''The Dennis Miller Show'' continued in the tradition of "[[Alternative culture|alternative]]" talk shows, which started with the ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' show, which debuted on [[NBC]] in 1982. [[Nick Bakay]] was the announcer, and [[Andy Summers]], formerly of the band [[The Police]], led the house band.

Guests included [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]], who made their national television debut on the show, [[Henry Rollins]] who appeared repeatedly to chat with Miller and perform [[spoken word]], and comedian [[Bill Hicks]].

The show's staff boasted a  mix of past and future performers, writers, and producers of note including [[Mark Brazill]] (''[[That '70s Show]]''), Eddie Feldmann, [[David Kohan]] and [[Max Mutchnick]] (creators of ''[[Will & Grace]]''), [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Bob Odenkirk]] (''[[Mr. Show]]''), [[John Riggi]], [[Kevin Rooney]], [[Herb Sargent]] (''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), [[Drake Sather]], and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (''[[Second City TV]]'').

The show was canceled after seven months, with the Tribune Entertainment CEO saying the show lacked "the ratings growth necessary to continue."<ref>{{cite news  | authorlink = Daniel Cerone  | author = Daniel Cerone  | title = Tribune Cancels Nighttime Talk Show 'Dennis Miller'  | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-18/business/fi-3649_1_dennis-miller  | work = [[Los Angeles Times]]  | date = 1992-07-18  | accessdate = 2014-02-02}}</ref>

===''Dennis Miller Live''===
Beginning in 1994, Miller hosted ''[[Dennis Miller Live]]'', a half-hour talk show on [[HBO]]. The show's theme song was the [[Tears for Fears]] hit "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]", and also utilized a snippet of the song "[[Civilized]]" by the [[Rollins Band]].
The show was taped at [[CBS Television City]] on the same stage that ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' is taped. It utilized a small set and sparse lighting, and there was no band. It comprised mainly Miller, speaking to the largely unseen studio audience, on a darkened stage.

Miller hosted one guest per show, with whom he would discuss the topic of the day. Early on, guests were all interviewed live via satellite, but soon most appeared live in the studio. There was also a call-in segment. The number was originally given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Later, he referred to it only by its numeric equivalent (1-800-522-8673). Within the time available, Miller typically could accommodate only two or three calls. He gradually eliminated call-ins entirely in the last few seasons of the show.

Miller and his writing staff won five [[Emmy Award]]s during the show's run, which aired 215 episodes over nine years. HBO cancelled the show in 2002.

===''Monday Night Football''===
In 2000, Miller beat out [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]] (among others) for a job as [[color commentator]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.<ref name=eonline>{{cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Mark |url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html |title=Dennis Miller Takes 'Monday Night' Pigskin|publisher=[[E!]]|date=June 22, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221060805/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html|archivedate=February 21, 2003}}</ref> His commentary was sprinkled with esoteric references.<ref name=annotatedmiller>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/annotatedmiller/archive.html |title=Website (called "Dennis Miller Annotated" that lists and explains all of Miller's Monday Night quips |publisher=ESPN |date=2002-01-14 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> A common Miller-ism was after a [[Hail Mary pass]] fell incomplete, he would say "Hail Mary is denied – [[separation of church and state]]." He also once referred to the "[[Greatest Show on Turf]]" [[St. Louis Rams]] receiving corps as the "Murderer's Row of Haste".  After two seasons, Miller and former [[San Diego Chargers]]' quarterback [[Dan Fouts]] (who worked alongside play-by-play man [[Al Michaels]]) were replaced by the veteran football commentator [[John Madden]]. In 2010, [[TV Guide Network]] listed Miller's stint at #12 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News – TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=2010-03-02|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref>

In 2003, Miller provided short-lived regular commentary for the [[Fox News]] show ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' before moving on to do a prime-time political show on [[CNBC]] in early 2004 called, simply, ''Dennis Miller''. The hour-long show contained a daily news segment called "The Daily [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]]", which was reminiscent of his ''Weekend Update'' segments. He also had a chimpanzee, as a nod to the early days of the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show and their mascot [[J. Fred Muggs]]. The show also featured a panel discussion dubbed "The Varsity", which offered a wide variety of political viewpoints on current topics. Frequent "Varsity" panelists included [[Ed Schultz]], [[Gloria Allred]], [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]], [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]], [[Mickey Kaus]], [[Steve Katz (politician)|Steven Katz]], [[Lawrence O'Donnell]], [[Phil Hendrie]], and [[Harry Shearer]]. CNBC cancelled the show in May 2005 due to declining viewership.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/12/news/newsmakers/cnbc_miller/ | publisher=CNN | title=CNBC cancels 'Dennis Miller' | date=May 12, 2005 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Guest appearances and commercials===
Miller has appeared as a guest or guest star on various shows, including ''[[Boston Public]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', ''[[Norm Macdonald|The Norm Show]]'', ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[SportsCenter]]'', "[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]" and late-night talk shows such as ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name|0588222}}</ref>

Miller hosted the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1995 and 1996. He was also the host of HBO's 1996 series of election specials, ''Not Necessarily the Election''.

He has appeared in various television commercials, serving as a spokesman for [[M&M's]] candies, 10-10-220 long distance service, and the Internet service provider [[NetZero]]. About these activities he has remarked: "Everybody has to [[sell out]] at some point to make a living. I'm a family man. I sold out to make an M&M commercial. They offer incredible amounts of money, and I say, ‘What can I do to sell one more piece of candy for you? Do you want me to hug the M&M?’"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[USA Today]]|url=http://159.54.226.237/97_issues/970720/970720talk_dennis_miller.html|title=Straight Talk.

===Return to Fox News Channel===
On September 21, 2006, Miller returned to [[Fox News| Fox News Channel]] with a two-and-a-half-minute commentary on [[illegal immigration]] during his "Real Free Speech" segment on ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215178,00.html | publisher=Fox News Channel | title=Funnyman Dennis Miller Returns to FNC! | date=September 22, 2006}}</ref> He appeared on 13 of the 17 aired episodes of the comedy show ''[[The Half Hour News Hour]]''. Currently, he has a weekly segment called "Miller Time" on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. Miller has also appeared on ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]'' under the pseudonym "Mansquito", a name Miller has pledged to use on future appearances on the network.

===Game shows===
Miller co-hosted the game show ''[[Grand Slam (US TV series)|Grand Slam]]'', which aired on [[GSN]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6449122.html |title=GSN Taps Dennis Miller To Host Grand Slam – 6/5/2007 12:56:00 AM – Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref>

For one month, Miller hosted ''[[Amne$ia]]'' for [[NBC]]. The show was a replacement program commissioned during the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]] and was canceled once the strike was resolved and scripted programming returned to the network.

===''Sports Unfiltered'' on Versus===
Miller's days as a sports commentator did not end when he left ''Monday Night Football.'' In 2007, Versus, now [[NBCSN]], tapped Miller to host ''Sports Unfiltered''.<ref>{{cite web|author=rickchand |url=http://deadspin.com/355359/whither-sports-unfiltered-with-dennis-miller |title=Whither Sports Unfiltered With Dennis Miller? |publisher=Deadspin.com |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref>

==Radio career==

===''The Dennis Miller Show''===
In January 2007, Miller signed a deal with [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] (later acquired by Dial Global, rebranded [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]]) to launch 
''[[The Dennis Miller Show (radio)|The Dennis Miller Show]]'', a weekday three-hour [[talk radio]] program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWEN204120070112 |title=Dennis Miller starting radio show on Westwood One |agency=Reuters |date= January 10, 2007|accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> The program debuted on March 26, 2007, and ran through February 27, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://affiliates.westwoodone.com/features/dennis-miller-show.asp |title=The Dennis Miller Show |publisher=Affiliates.westwoodone.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> The show's website<ref>{{cite web|author=Payam Zarrabizadeh |url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/ |title=The Official Home of Dennis Miller on the Web |publisher=Dennismillerradio.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> provided a live stream of the broadcast. The site also made archives of all shows available in [[MP3]] format. The live feed was free, but a subscription to the Dennis Miller Zone (DMZ) was required in order to access archived broadcasts. The show aired on 250+ stations, many of which (especially in the major markets at the time of the show's launch) are owned by [[Salem Communications]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/20/121544.shtml?s=ic |title=Dennis Miller Readies to Host Radio Show |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> airing on tape delay on some of those stations between 6–9 pm ET and 9 pm-12 am ET. Salem stations also aired a "best of" Miller show on Saturdays. His on-air sidekick "Salman" ([[David S. Weiss]]) also wrote for ''Dennis Miller Live''. His producer Christian Bladt previously appeared on-camera as dozens of different characters during the "Daily Rorschach" segment on his CNBC television show.

Miller's program included serious discussions about American culture, current events, politics, and their place in the global context. The show was infused with Miller's sarcasm, which is often characterized by obscure [[pop culture]] references.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millerjoke.com/ |title=Dennis Miller Joke Generator}}</ref> For example, each hour of the show once opened with an arcane reference. The first hour's opening phrase was a combination of dialogue from the film ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' and a U.S. space program slogan coined by [[Alan Shepard]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/show?action=viewRadioShow&showID=70|title=Dennis Miller Radio: The Dennis Miller Show|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> "What's up, Hiroshi? Let's light this candle!" Miller's other opening phrases for his second and third hours respectively were "Come to me my babies, let me quell your pain", ([[Powers Boothe]] as [[Jim Jones]] in ''[[Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones]]''<ref>Dennis Miller Radio Show, Hour 2, December 18, 2007./</ref>) and "ABC – '''A'''lways '''b'''e '''c'''losing if you want the knife set" (from ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'').

Most shows featured three guests (one per hour), mostly from the world of politics and entertainment, as well as calls from listeners. Guests include fellow comedians and ''SNL'' alumni (such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]]), pundits and authors such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Aaron Klein]] and [[Mark Steyn]] (while the show's guest list leans [[right-wing|right of center]], there are several [[liberals]] who have appeared on the show, such as [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some "regulars" like columnists and conservatives such as [[Debra Saunders]], [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Victor Davis Hanson]], [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], [[William Kristol|Bill Kristol]], and [[Jerome Corsi]] along with entertainers such as singer [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]] and actor [[Orson Bean]]. Miller generally took calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encouraged humorous callers and often comments on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays was set aside for "Dennis [[Deus Ex Machina|Ex Machina]]", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allowed phone calls on any topic.

According to ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'', as of spring 2011, Miller's show has an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners.<ref>{{cite news | title= The Top Talk Radio Audiences | year=2011 | work= [[Talkers Magazine]]|url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ }}</ref>  Miller and [[Dial Global]] signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/dennis-miller-re-ups-with-dial-global/|title=Dennis Miller re-ups with Dial-Global|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Miller ended the radio show after his current contract expires on March 27, 2015.<ref name=radioinsight>[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92131/dennis-miller-to-end-syndicated-show/ "Dennis Miller To End Syndicated Show"] from Radio Insight (February 27, 2015)</ref>

===Other endeavors===
Miller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.

He has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: ''The Rants'' (1996), ''Ranting Again'' (1999), ''I Rant, Therefore I Am'' (2000), and ''The Rant Zone'' (2001).

Miller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'', ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[Never Talk to Strangers]]'', ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' and ''[[Murder at 1600]]''. He plays the [[Howard Stern]]-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in ''[[Joe Dirt]]'' (2001) and appears as himself in ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' (2006).

Miller guest hosted the [[Slammy Award]]s episode of [[WWE Raw]] on December 14, 2009.

==Comedic style==
Miller is known for his laid-back style (for example, calling people "babe" or referring to them as "cats") and acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant—a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[monologue]] in which he rails against whatever happens to be bothering him at the moment. Such rants typically begin with "Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but..." and end with "...of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong."

==Personal life==
Miller married Carolyn "Ali" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as "Espley" or "Epsley." In the closing credits of ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'', she is listed as "Ali Espley".</ref> a former [[model (person)|model]] from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], on April 10, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in [[Kajagoogoo]]'s "[[Too Shy]]" music video. The couple live in [[Santa Barbara, California]], with their two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller has been a manager for comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].

==Political views==
Although in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], in recent years, Miller has become known for his [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political opinions.<ref>{{cite web | author=Currie, Duncan | date=27 June 2003| title=Dennis the Right-Wing Menace? | work=National Review | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp | accessdate=February 27, 2006}}</ref>

He is a regular political commentator on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in a segment called "Miller Time", and previously appeared on the network's ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' in a segment called "Real Free Speech." During the [[2012 United States Presidential Election|Presidential election of 2012]], Miller appeared on [[Fox News Channel]] and said that under [[Barack Obama]], the US is on the road to the "[[Europe]]an model."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

During the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], ever eager to bash [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans. This perception did not change much even when Miller told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 1995: "I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings. On most issues, between [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[Newt Gingrich]], I'd choose Newt in a second, even though he is a bit too exclusionary."<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp |title=Duncan Currie on Dennis Miller on National Review Online |publisher=Nationalreview.com |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> Miller also declared himself a "[[Libertarian conservatism|conservative libertarian]]" in a 1996 ''Playboy'' interview.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

Miller's ideology changed significantly in the years following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]],<ref name=CNN>{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | date=26 January 2004| title=Dennis Miller: '9–11 changed me' | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap/ | accessdate=February 27, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060208220107/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap/ |archivedate = February 8, 2006}}</ref> when he became one of the few [[Hollywood]] celebrities backing [[George W. Bush]] and the [[war in Iraq]].<ref name=CNN/> Miller has said that one of the defining moments, in addition to 9/11, for his move from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was watching a 2004 [[primary election|primary]] debate between the nine Democrats then contending for their party's nomination. "I haven't seen a starting nine like that since the [[1962 New York Mets season|'62 Mets]]", he remarked.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

[[Slate magazine|Slate.com]] commentator Dennis Cass describes Miller as having changed from a "left-leaning, [[Dada]]-ist wisenheimer" to a "tell-it-like-it-is, right-wing blowhard."<ref>{{cite web | author=Cass, Dennis | date=6 February 2004| title=Blinded by the Right: Dennis Miller's new talk show is all about his political conversion | work=Slate | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2095127 | accessdate=March 1, 2006}}</ref> The perceived change did not surprise former ''Saturday Night Live'' colleague and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] Senator [[Al Franken]], however: "People have said to me, ‘What happened to Dennis?’ Nothing happened to Dennis. He's the same Dennis. He's always had a conservative streak on certain issues."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap/ |title=Dennis Miller: '9-11 changed me' |date=January 26, 2004 |publisher=CNN |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308131736/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap/ |archivedate=March 8, 2008}}</ref>

While not at all shy about expressing his conservative views on topics such as [[taxes]] and [[foreign policy]], Miller is quick to point out that he is still quite [[Cultural liberalism|liberal]] on many social issues, including [[abortion]] and [[gay marriage]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> During an interview, Miller said "I'm basically a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. I'm pro-gay marriage and [[pro-choice]], but nobody wants to hear all that.... They determine who you are based on the war."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} During an interview on ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'', he said that he did not believe in [[global warming]].<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/116187813997730.xml&coll=1 ''The Patriot News'']{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>

In a radio interview with [[Penn Jillette]] on September 22, 2006, Miller explained his libertarianism, saying, "...[a libertarian is] what I am, I'll be honest with you. I'm for gay marriage. I don't believe in abortion but I'm pro-choice 'cause it's none of my business. Pretty much anything goes with me if you're not infringing yourself on other people but, I'll tell ya, 9/11 changed me.... You gotta go around and explain it to people and they think you're a [[turncoat]]."

On February 21, 2007, while appearing as a guest on ''The O'Reilly Factor'', and again on May 25, 2007, while appearing as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Miller stated that he initially supported [[Rudy Giuliani]] for [[United States presidential election, 2008|president in 2008]]. After Giuliani's departure from the race he redirected his support to [[John McCain]].

Miller endorsed [[Herman Cain]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican primary]], but later dropped his support, saying of Cain, "He can't win!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Bershad|first=Jon|title=Dennis Miller Drops His Endorsement Of Herman Cain: ‘He Can’t Win!’|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/dennis-miller-drops-his-endorsement-of-herman-cain-he-cant-win/|accessdate=March 20, 2012|newspaper=The Ticket|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> He later campaigned for [[Mitt Romney]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|general election]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohn|first=Alicia M.|title=Dennis Miller endorses Romney as the 'gosh president'|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/262729-dennis-miller-endorses-romney-as-the-gosh-president|newspaper=The Hill|date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>

On His podcast "The PO'D Cast" with Adam Carolla and Dennis Miller. Miller stated that one of the factors was watching Democrats mock and ridicule former VP candidate James Stockdale. He quips how that Stockdale who "tapped out Morse Code prayers with American POWs so they wouldn't kill themselves, is getting hammered because he isn't good on TV."
