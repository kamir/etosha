'''''Important Things with Demetri Martin''''' is a [[sketch comedy|sketch]]-[[variety show]] that aired on [[Comedy Central]] starring comedian [[Demetri Martin]]. Each episode examined a single theme, the "important thing", such as timing, power, control and money. All sketches, short vignettes, animated segments and stand-up comedy were loosely related to the theme of the episode. The show was produced by [[Jon Stewart]]'s [[Busboy Productions]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iff0ec139962d42d4152b670707cce783 |title=Stewart stamp on 'Martin' |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
and contained [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]], [[prop comedy]] and musical comedy by Martin, as well as taped sketches. Jon Stewart took an active role in editing the first few episodes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/sphereNews/idUSN0344522620071003?sp=true&view=sphere | work=Reuters | title=Jon Stewart producing new Comedy Central show | date=October 3, 2007}}</ref>

==Recurring segments==
In addition to Demetri's unconventional style of stand-up comedy, which he has performed for many years, there are several recurring segments on the show including:

'''Opening Act'''&nbsp;– In the opening of the show, Demetri Martin greets the audience and brings up the theme/topic of the show. This is followed with a short joke via flashcards. The card generally has play-buttons with a caption under them, which Demetri then reads and decides which one he will choose, usually "Jokes".

'''Good, Bad, Interesting'''&nbsp;– Demetri presents a good, a bad and an interesting reaction to topics based on everyday life situations.

'''This is...'''&nbsp;– Often used as a transition, this segment features a single humorous concept related to the show's topic in which one or more cast members will act out.

'''Important Things Things'''&nbsp;– An infomercial narrated by Demetri in which imaginary products related to the show's topic are advertised for sale. The products are often comically impractical or unnecessary like the "Burning-Hand Potholder" featured in the Strategy episode.

'''Demetrocles/Da Mici'''&nbsp;– In this segment, Demetri presents a humorous concept related to the show's topic as an ancient philosopher much like Socrates or Plato or an inventor like Da Vinci.

'''Other Jokes'''&nbsp;– This segment consists of other jokes about the topic that weren't included in the Opening Act.

'''New Expressions'''&nbsp;– In this segment Demetri is approached by a series of people that talk about different situations. Demetri responds to each person with an original saying/expression that applies to the situation.
