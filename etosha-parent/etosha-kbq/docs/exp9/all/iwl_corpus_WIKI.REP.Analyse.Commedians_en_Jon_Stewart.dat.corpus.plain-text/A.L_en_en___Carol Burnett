'''Carol Creighton Burnett''' (born April 26, 1933) is an American actress, comedian, singer, and writer. She is best known for her long-running TV variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', for [[CBS]]. She has achieved success on stage, television, and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedy roles.

After a difficult childhood in [[San Antonio, Texas]] with alcoholic parents, Burnett discovered acting and comedy in college. She performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's television run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]].

During and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She also returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].

Burnett's parents divorced in the late 1930s, and she and her grandmother moved to an apartment near Burnett's mother’s in an impoverished area of [[Hollywood]]. There they stayed in a [[boarding house]] with Burnett's younger half-sister Chrissie.<ref>[http://carolburnettfan.com/biography.html Carol Burnett Fan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When Burnett was in second grade, she briefly invented an [[imaginary friend|imaginary]] twin sister named Karen, with [[Shirley Temple]]-like dimples. Motivated to further the pretense, Burnett fondly recalls that she "fooled the other boarders in the rooming house where we lived by frantically switching clothes and dashing in and out of the house by the fire escape and the front door. Then I became exhausted and Karen mysteriously vanished."<ref name="JoanDowns">Joan Downs. "Here's to you, Mrs. Hamilton." ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.

For a while, she worked as an usherette at what is now the [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]] (the [[forecourt]] of which is now the location of her star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]; see [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre#Influence on Carol Burnett's star on Hollywood Walk of Fame|the section in the theatre's article]] for more information). After graduating from [[Hollywood High School]] in 1951, Burnett received an anonymous envelope containing $50 for one year's tuition at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where she initially planned on studying journalism.<ref name=Rehm>{{cite news |url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2013-04-10/carol-burnett-carrie-and-me-mother-daughter-love-story/transcript |title=Carol Burnett: "Carrie and Me: A Mother-Daughter Love Story" |publisher=''[[The Diane Rehm Show]]'' |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 | first=Diane | last=Rehm}}</ref> During her first year of college, Burnett switched her focus to theater arts and English, with the goal of becoming a playwright. She found she had to take an acting course to enter the playwright program; "I wasn't really ready to do the acting thing, but I had no choice."<ref name=Star>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/645801 |title=One laugh changed Carol Burnett's life |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=June 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 18, 2009 | first=Richard | last=Ouzounian}}</ref> She followed a sudden impulse in her first performance; "Don't ask me why, but when we were in front of the audience, I suddenly decided I was going to stretch out all my words and my first line came out 'I'm baaaaaaaack!'"<ref name=Star/> The audience response moved her deeply:

{{cquote|They laughed and it felt great. All of a sudden, after so much coldness and emptiness in my life, I knew the sensation of all that warmth wrapping around me. I had always been a quiet, shy, sad sort of girl and then everything changed for me. You spend the rest of your life hoping you'll hear a laugh that great again.<ref name=Star/>}}

During this time, Burnett performed in several university productions, garnering recognition for her comedic and musical abilities. Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:

{{cquote|She wanted me to be a writer. She said you can always write, no matter what you look like. When I was growing up she told me to be a little lady, and a couple of times I got a whack for crossing my eyes or making funny faces. Of course, she never, I never, dreamed I would ever perform.<ref name="JoanDowns" />}}

The young Burnett, always insecure about her looks, responded many years afterward to her mother's advice, "You can always write, no matter what you look like," in Burnett's memoir ''One More Time'' (1986), noting, "God, that hurt!"

During her senior year at UCLA, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience). Afterwards, a man and his wife approached Burnett while Carol was stuffing cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother.<ref name=Sun>{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/story.html?id=2001007 |title=Carol Burnett's comedy reign extends into dramatic role |last=Birnie |first=Peter |publisher=''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> Instead of reprimanding her, the man complimented Burnett's performance and asked about her future plans. When he learned that Burnett wished to travel to New York in order to try her luck in musical comedy but couldn't afford the trip, right then and there he offered Carol<ref name=Sun/> and her boyfriend Don Saroyan each a $1,000 interest-free loan. His conditions were simply that the loans were to be repaid within five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she achieved  success, she would help other aspiring talents to pursue their artistic dreams.<ref name=Sun/> Burnett took him up on his offer; she and Saroyan left college and moved to New York to pursue acting careers. That same year, Burnett's father died of causes related to his alcoholism.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Career==

===Early career===
After spending her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and failing to land acting jobs, Burnett along with other girls living at the [[Rehearsal Club (New York)|Rehearsal Club]], a boarding house for women seriously pursuing an acting career, put on ''The Rehearsal Club Revue'' on March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. Burnett was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist’s dummy on the popular children’s program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956 to 1957.

After ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called "I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, Burnett performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Burnett also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time. In 1957, just as Burnett was achieving her first small successes, her mother died.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960.]]
Burnett's first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. The same year, she became a regular player on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', a job that lasted until 1962. She won an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/carol-burnett|title=Carol Burnett Emmy Winner|publisher=The Emmys|accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref> that year for her "Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series" on the show. Burnett portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who would later become her signature alter-ego. With her success on the ''Moore Show'', Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1962), co-starring her friend [[Julie Andrews]]. The show was produced by [[Bob Banner]], directed by [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], and written by [[Mike Nichols]] and Ken Welch.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shulman |first1=Arthur |last2=Youman |first2=Roger|title=How Sweet It Was.

In 1964, Burnett starred in the Broadway musical ''[[Fade Out - Fade In]]'' but was forced to withdraw after sustaining a neck injury in a taxi accident. She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, ''[[The Entertainers]]'', opposite [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Bob Newhart]]. The producers of ''Fade Out – Fade In'' sued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped. ''The Entertainers'' ran for only one season.<ref name="Suskin, Steven 2006 90–93">{{cite news|author=Suskin, Steven |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H8mb_JMx4u0C&pg=PA90 |title=Fade Out-Fade In|work=Second Act Trouble|date=2006|isbn= 1-55783-631-0|pages= 90–93}}</ref>

Around the same time, Burnett became good friends with [[Jim Nabors]], who was enjoying great success with his series ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' As a result of their close friendship, Burnett played a recurring role on Nabors' show as a tough corporal, later [[gunnery sergeant]]. Nabors would later be her first guest every season on her variety show.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/784/000022718/ Biography of Carol Burnett at www.nndb.com]</ref>

In 1966, [[Lucille Ball]] became a friend and mentor to Burnett. After having guested on Burnett's highly successful CBS-TV special ''[[Carol + 2]]'' and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing on ''[[The Lucy Show]],'' Ball reportedly offered Burnett her own sitcom called "Here's Agnes," to be produced by [[Desilu Productions]]. Burnett declined the offer, not wanting to commit herself to a weekly series. The two remained close friends until Ball's death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on Burnett's birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Lucille Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnett's house with a note reading, "Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy."<ref name="MitchellFink">Fink, Mitchell. ''The Last Days of Dead Celebrities''.

===''The Carol Burnett Show''===

In 1967, CBS offered to put Burnett in a weekly comedy series called ''Here's Agnes''. However, Burnett had a stipulation in her ten-year contract with CBS that said she had five years from the date ''The Garry Moore Show'' ended to "push the button" on hosting thirty one-hour episodes of a music/comedy variety show. As a result, the hour-long ''Carol Burnett Show'' was born and debuted in September 1967, garnering 23 [[Emmy Award]]s and winning or being nominated for multiple Emmy and [[Golden Globe Awards]] every season it was on the air. Its ensemble cast included [[Tim Conway]] (who was a guest player until the ninth season),<ref name="ET">Interview on ''Entertainment Tonight''. May 22, 2006.</ref> [[Harvey Korman]], [[Lyle Waggoner]], and the teenaged [[Vicki Lawrence]], whom Burnett herself discovered and mentored. The network initially did not want her to do a variety show because they believed only men could be successful at variety, but Burnett's contract required that they give her one season of whatever kind of show she wanted to make.<ref name ="LAT">[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/10/entertainment/ca-34154?s=g&n=n&m=Broad&rd=www.google.com&tnid=1&sessid=ad58030466016a68964a5a2cf0fc4737e8af7121&uuid=ad58030466016a68964a5a2cf0fc4737e8af7121&pgtp=article&eagi=&cat=entertainment&page_type=article&exci=2000_10_10_entertainment_ca-34154&pg=1] ''LA Times Interview''</ref> She chose to carry on the tradition of past variety show successes.

A true variety show, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' struck a chord with viewers. Among other things, it parodied films ("Went With the Wind" for ''[[Gone With the Wind]]''), television ("As the Stomach Turns" for the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch "The Family", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring [[Vicki Lawrence]].

Burnett opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib. On numerous occasions, she obliged when asked to perform her trademark<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allday.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2008/03/12/4378081-carol-burnetts-tarzan-yell |title=Carol Burnett's Tarzan Yell |publisher=allDAY on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> [[Tarzan yell]].

Burnett ended each show by tugging on her left ear, which was a message to her grandmother who raised her. This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her. During the show's run, Burnett's grandmother died. On an ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: "She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!"<ref>[[Lifetime Television|Lifetime Channel]]'s ''[[Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett</ref> Burnett continued the tradition of tugging her ear.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' ceased production in 1978, Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the summer of 1979 under the title, ''[[Carol Burnett and Company]]'' basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of Burnett's series were edited into half-hour episodes entitled ''[[Carol Burnett and Friends]]'', which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication. In January 2015, ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' began airing on [[MeTV]].

===Other roles===
Burnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]''. After her show ended, Burnett assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]''. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the film ''Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice'', a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), and ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in Season 2 of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.

Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series ''[[Sesame Street]]'', on that series' first episode on November 10, 1969. She also made occasional returns to the stage in the 1970s and 80s. In 1974, she appeared at [[The Muny]] Theater in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' with [[Rock Hudson]], and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''. Burnett made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, [[Mark Goodson]] awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title [[Password Plus]], when it was originally planned to be titled ''Password '79'').

In the 1980s and 1990s, Burnett made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' "[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]" sketches spinoff, ''[[Mama's Family]]'', as her stormy character, [[Eunice Higgins]]. She played the matriarch in the [[cult following|cult]] comedy miniseries ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', which parodied the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. She returned to TV in the mid-1990s as a supporting character on the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman ([[Helen Hunt]]), for which she won another Emmy Award. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue ''[[Putting It Together]]''.

Burnett has long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]''. She realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. Burnett reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale.

In 2008, Burnett had her second role as an animated character in the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. Her first was in ''The Trumpet of the Swan'' in 2001. In 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

Falwell'', 485 U.S. 46, 51, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). Here, ''Family Guy'' put a cartoon version of Carol Burnett/the charwoman in an awkward, ridiculous, crude, and absurd situation in order to [[Parody|lampoon]] and parody her as a public figure. Therefore, the Court finds that a parodic character may reasonably be perceived in the'' Family Guy''{{'}}s use of the Charwoman because it is a “literary or artistic work that broadly mimics an author's characteristic style and holds it up to ridicule.”}}</ref>
