'''Eugene Victor''' "'''Gene'''" '''Debs''' (November 5, 1855 – October 20, 1926) was an American [[Trade union|union]] leader, one of the founding members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW or the Wobblies), and [[Perennial candidate|five times the candidate]] of the [[Socialist Party of America]] for [[President of the United States]].<ref name=time>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Eugene V. Debs |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722648,00.html |quote=As it must to all men, Death came last week to Eugene Victor Debs, Socialist |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= November 1, 1926 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> Through his presidential candidacies, as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known [[socialism|socialists]] living in the United States.

Early in his political career, Debs was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He was elected as a Democrat to the [[Indiana General Assembly]] in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]], Debs was instrumental in the founding of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), one of the nation's first [[industrial unions]]. After workers at the [[Pullman Palace Car Company]] organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide [[Pullman Strike]], affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President [[Grover Cleveland]] used the [[United States Army]] to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.

In prison, Debs read the works of [[Karl Kautsky]], a chief expositor of [[Karl Marx]], and learned about socialism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darrow.law.umn.edu/photo.php?pid=1187 |title=Karl Kautsky |publisher=University of Minnesota Law Library, Clarence Darrow Digital Collection}}</ref><ref>Ginger, Ray ''The Bending Cross: A Biography of Eugene Victor Debs'' 1969 Russell & Russell, pp. 173</ref> Upon his release, he launched his career as the nation's most prominent Socialist in the first decades of the 20th century. He ran as the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900]] (earning 0.63% of the popular vote), [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904]] (2.98%), [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]] (2.83%), [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]] (5.99%), and [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]] (3.41%), the last time from a prison cell.

Debs was noted for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American participation in [[World War I]] led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and sentenced to a term of 10 years. President [[Warren G. Harding]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his sentence in December 1921. Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a [[sanatorium]].

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Eugene Debs was born on November 5, 1855, in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to Jean Daniel and Marguerite Mari Bettrich Debs, who both immigrated to the United States from [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]], France. His father, who came from a prosperous family in France, owned a textile mill and meat market. Debs was named after the French authors [[Eugene Sue]] and [[Victor Hugo]].<ref name="socialistworker">{{cite web| url=http://www.socialistworker.org/2007-2/638/638_12_Debs.shtml| title=The Socialist Worker| accessdate=2007-07-19| author=Bill Roberts}}</ref>

Debs attended public school, dropping out of high school at age 14.<ref name=RTimes>"Biographical: Eugene V. Debs," ''Railway Times'' [Chicago], vol. 2, no. 17 (Sept. 2, 1895), p. 2.</ref> He took a job in the Vandalia railroad car shops, first working as a painter and a car cleaner.<ref name=RTimes /> In December 1871 he left the railroad yards for work on the railways as a [[fireman (steam engine)|locomotive fireman]] for the same company.<ref name=RTimes />

In July 1875 he left to work at a wholesale grocery house, where he remained for the next four years,<ref name=RTimes /> attending a local business school at night.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.eugenevdebs.com/pages/history.html |title=Eugene Victor Debs 1855–1926 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080505031225/http://www.eugenevdebs.com/pages/history.html |archivedate = May 5, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Debs had joined the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]] (BLF) in February 1875 and became active in this fraternal benefit organization. In 1877 he served as a delegate of the Terre Haute lodge to the organization's national convention.<ref name=RTimes /> Debs was elected associate editor of the BLF's monthly organ, ''Firemen's Magazine'', in 1878. Two years later, he was appointed Grand Secretary and Treasurer of the BLF and editor of the magazine in July 1880.<ref name=RTimes /> He worked as a BLF functionary until January 1893 and as the magazine's editor until September 1894.<ref name=RTimes />

At the same time he became a prominent figure in the community. He served two terms as Terre Haute's city clerk from September 1879 to September 1883.<ref name=RTimes /> In the fall of 1884 he was elected to the [[Indiana General Assembly]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], serving for one term.<ref name=bio/>

===Marriage and family===
Eugene Debs married Kate Metzel on June 9, 1885.<ref name=bio/> [[Eugene V. Debs Home|Their home]] still stands in Terre Haute, preserved on the campus of [[Indiana State University]].

==Labor activism==
The railroad brotherhoods were comparatively conservative organizations, focused on providing fellowship and services rather than on collective bargaining. Debs gradually became convinced of the need for a more unified and confrontational approach as railroads were powerful companies in the economy.  One influence was his involvement in the [[Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888]], a defeat for labor that convinced Debs of the necessity of organizing along craft lines.<ref>Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age, edited by Leonard C. Schlup, James G. Ryan, page 405</ref>

After stepping down as Brotherhood Grand Secretary in 1893, Debs organized one of the first [[industrial union]]s in the United States, the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), for unskilled workers. The Union successfully struck the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in April 1894, winning most of its demands.

=== Pullman Strike ===
{{see also|Pullman Strike}}
[[File:Pullman strikers outside Arcade Building.jpg|thumb|[[Strike action|Striking]] [[American Railway Union]] members confront [[Illinois Army National Guard|Illinois National Guard]] troops in [[Chicago]], during Debs' Rebellion in 1894.]]
In 1894 Debs became involved in the [[Pullman Strike]], which grew out of a compensation dispute started by the workers who constructed the train cars made by the [[Pullman Palace Car Company]]. The Pullman Company, citing falling revenue after the economic [[Panic of 1893]], had cut the wages of its employees by 28%. The workers, many of whom were already members of the [[American Railway Union]], appealed for support to the union at its convention in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name=time/> Debs tried to persuade the Union members who worked on the railways that the boycott was too risky, given the hostility of both the railways and the federal government, the weakness of the union, and the possibility that other unions would break the strike. The membership ignored his warnings and refused to handle Pullman cars or any other railroad cars attached to them, including cars containing U.S. Mail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/eugene-v-debs-papers-1881-1940.pdf
|title=Eugene V. Debs Papers, 1881–1940|accessdate=2012-11-05|last=Latham |first=Charles |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Indiana Historical Society}}</ref> After A.R.U. Board Director Martin J. Elliot extended the strike to St. Louis, doubling its size to 80,000 workers, Debs relented and decided to take part in the strike, which was now endorsed by almost all members of the ARU in the immediate area of Chicago.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B1FFE3E5515738DDDA00A94DE405B8485F0D3 | work=The New York Times | title=Embracing More Railroads; Pullman Boycott Extending, The Men Being Determined.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] intervened, obtaining an [[injunction]] against the strike on the theory that the strikers had obstructed the U.S. Mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to show up for work. President [[Grover Cleveland]] sent the [[United States Army]] to enforce the injunction. The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike; 13 strikers were killed, and thousands were blacklisted.<ref name="socialistworker"/> An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison.<ref name="socialistworker"/>

Debs was represented by [[Clarence Darrow]], hitherto a [[corporate lawyer]] for the railroad company, who "switched sides" to represent Debs. Darrow, a leading American lawyer and civil [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], had resigned his corporate position in order to represent Debs, making a substantial financial sacrifice in order to do so.  A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case decision, ''[[In re Debs]]'', later upheld the right of the federal government to issue the injunction.

== Socialist leader ==
[[File:Eugene Debs Martin Elliott 300.jpg|right|thumb|Rogers, Elliott, Keliher, Hogan, Burns, Goodwin, and Debs – the seven ARU officers jailed following the loss of the 1894 Pullman strike.]]

At the time of his arrest for mail obstruction, Debs was not yet a [[socialist]]. While serving his six-month term in the jail at [[Woodstock, Illinois]], Debs and his ARU comrades received a steady stream of letters, books, and pamphlets in the mail from socialists around the country.<ref name=HowIBecame>Eugene V. Debs, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1902/howi.htm "How I Became a Socialist."] ''The Comrade,'' April 1902.</ref>

Debs recalled several years later:

<blockquote>
"...I began to read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be shattered and battered and splintered at a single stroke. The writings of [[Edward Bellamy|Bellamy]] and [[Robert Blatchford|Blatchford]] early appealed to me. ''The Cooperative Commonwealth'' of [[Laurence Gronlund|Gronlund]] also impressed me, but the writings of [[Karl Kautsky|Kautsky]] were so clear and conclusive that I readily grasped, not merely his argument, but also caught the spirit of his socialist utterance – and I thank him and all who helped me out of darkness into light."<ref name=HowIBecame /></blockquote>

Additionally, Debs was visited in jail by Milwaukee socialist newspaper editor [[Victor L. Berger]], who, in Debs' words, "came to Woodstock, as if a providential instrument, and delivered the first impassioned message of Socialism I had ever heard."<ref name=HowIBecame /> In his 1926 obituary in ''Time'', it was said that Berger left him a copy of [[Das Kapital]] and "prisoner Debs read it slowly, eagerly, ravenously."<ref>{{cite news|title=Eugene V. Debs. Obituary |work=Time |date=November 1926 |volume=8 |issue=18 |page=14 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722648,00.html}}</ref> Debs emerged from jail at the end of his sentence a changed man. He would spend the final three decades of his life proselytizing for the socialist cause.

After Debs' release from prison in 1895, he started his Socialist political career.   Debs persuaded the [[American Railway Union]] membership to join with the [[Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth]] to found the [[Social Democracy of America]].   Debs, along with Elliott, were the first federal office candidates for the fledgling Socialist party, running (unsuccessfully) for US president and Congress in 1900.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=7Wn7neVbyPMC&lpg=PA338&ots=t1K5ulffIP&dq=martin%20J%20elliott%20montana%201900%20legislature&pg=PA338#v=onepage&q=martin%20J%20elliott%20montana%201900%20legislature&f=false The Tribune almanac and political register edited by Horace Greeley, John Fitch Cleveland, F.

Debs' wife Kate was opposed to Debs' socialism.<ref>Kate Debs seemed to have been so hostile to Debs's socialist activities – it threatened her sense of middle-class respectability – that novelist Irving Stone was led to call her, in the title of his fictional portrayal of the life of Debs, the ''Adversary in the House''. (Daniel Bell, ''Marxian Socialism in the United States'', footnote on page 88)</ref> The "tempestuous relationship with a wife who rejects the very values he holds most dear" was the basis of [[Irving Stone]]'s [[biographical novel]] ''[[Adversary in the House]]''.<ref>[http://education.boisestate.edu/bdavies/adversay_in_the_house.htm Adversary in the House]</ref>

===Split to found the Social Democratic Party===
[[File:debs campaign.jpg|right|thumb|Campaign poster from his [[U.S. presidential election, 1912|1912 Presidential campaign]], featuring Debs and Vice Presidential candidate [[Emil Seidel]]]]

One year later this group split and Debs went with the majority faction to found the [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Social Democratic Party of the United States]], also called the Social Democratic Party.  Debs was elected chairman of the Executive Board of the National Council, the board which governed the party. But the party did not have a sole figure that governed its actions, Debs' position as chairman and his notoriety gave him the status of party figurehead.<ref>[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/socialistparty.html The Social Democracy of America Party History] Marxist History. Retrieved July 29, 2008.</ref>   He was the [[Socialist Party of America]] candidate for president in [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904]], [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]], [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], and [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]] (the final time from prison).

In his showing in the 1904 election, Debs received 402,810 votes, which was 2.98% of the popular vote. Debs received no electoral votes, and, with vice presidential candidate [[Benjamin Hanford]], ultimately finished third overall.<ref>[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1904 1904 Presidential General Election Results]. Retrieved July 21, 2008.</ref> In the 1908 election, Debs again ran on the same ticket as Benjamin Hanford. While receiving a slightly higher number of votes in the popular vote, 420,852, he received 2.83% of the popular vote. Again Debs received no electoral votes.<ref>[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1908 1908 Presidential General Election Results].

Retrieved July 22, 2008.</ref>

Although he received some success as a [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] candidate, Debs was largely dismissive of the electoral process; he distrusted the political bargains that [[Victor Berger]] and other "[[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]]" had made in winning local offices. He put much more value on organizing workers into unions, favoring unions that brought together all workers in a given industry over those organized by the craft skills workers practiced.

=== Founding the IWW ===

After his work with the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]] and the [[American Railway Union]], Debs' next major work in organizing a labor union came during the founding of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW). On June 27, 1905, in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Debs and other influential union leaders including [[Big Bill Haywood]], leader of the [[Western Federation of Miners]], and [[Daniel De León]], leader of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]], held what Haywood called the "Continental Congress of the working class". Haywood stated: "We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class...",<ref>The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 181.</ref> and for Debs: "We are here to perform a task so great that it appeals to our best thought, our united energies, and will enlist our most loyal support; a task in the presence of which weak men might falter and despair, but from which it is impossible to shrink without betraying the working class."<ref>[http://www.vlib.us/amdocs/texts/debs1905.html Eugene V. Debs Speech at the Founding of the IWW] Documents for the Study of American History. Retrieved July 29, 2008.</ref>

=== Socialists split with the IWW ===

Although the IWW was built on the basis of uniting workers of industry, a rift began between the union and the Socialist Party. It started when the electoral wing of the Socialist Party, led by [[Victor L. Berger|Victor Berger]] and [[Morris Hillquit]], became irritated with speeches by Haywood.<ref>Peter Carlson, ''Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood.'' New York: W.W. Norton, 1983; pg. 156.</ref> In December 1911, Haywood told a Lower East Side audience at New York's Cooper Union that parliamentary Socialists were "step-at-a-time people whose every step is just a little shorter than the preceding step." It was better, Haywood said, to "elect the superintendent of some branch of industry, than to elect some congressman to the United States Congress."<ref>Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg. 157.</ref> In response, Hillquit attacked the IWW as "purely anarchistic..."<ref name="Roughneck159">Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg. 159.</ref>

The Cooper Union speech was the beginning of a split between Bill Haywood and the Socialist Party, leading to the split between the factions of the IWW, one faction loyal to the Socialist Party, and the other to Haywood.<ref name="Roughneck159"/> The rift presented a problem for Debs, who was influential in both the IWW and the Socialist Party. The final straw between Haywood and the Socialist Party came during the [[Lawrence Textile Strike]] when, disgusted with the decision of the elected officials in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], to send police who subsequently used their clubs on children, Haywood publicly declared that "I will not vote again" until such a circumstance was rectified.<ref>Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg. 183.</ref> Haywood was purged from the National Executive Committee by passage of an amendment that focused on the [[direct action]] and [[sabotage]] tactics advocated by the IWW.<ref>Carlson, ''Roughneck'', 200</ref> Debs was probably the only person who could have saved Haywood's seat.<ref name="Roughneck199"/>

In 1906, when Haywood had been on trial for his life in Idaho, Debs had described him as "the Lincoln of Labor" and called for Haywood to run against [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for President of the United States,<ref>Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg. 109.</ref> but times had changed and Debs, facing a split in the Party, chose to echo Hillquit's words, accusing the IWW of representing anarchy.<ref name="Big Bill Haywood 1929, page 279">William D. Haywood, ''The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood.'' New York: International Publishers, 1929; pg. 279.</ref> Debs thereafter stated that he had opposed the amendment, but that once it was adopted it should be obeyed.<ref name="Roughneck199">Carlson, ''Roughneck,'' pg. 199.</ref> Debs remained friendly to Haywood and the IWW after the expulsion, despite their perceived differences over IWW tactics.<ref name="Big Bill Haywood 1929, page 279"/>
[[File:Debs Canton 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Debs delivering a speech in Chicago in 1912.]]
Prior to Haywood's dismissal, the Socialist Party membership had reached an all-time high of 135,000. One year later, four months after Haywood was recalled, the membership dropped to 80,000. The reformists in the Socialist Party attributed the decline to the departure of the "Haywood element", and predicted that the party would recover. It did not; in the election of 1912 many of the Socialists who had been elected to public office lost their seats.<ref name="Roughneck199"/>

=== Leadership style ===

Debs was noted by many to be a charismatic speaker who sometimes called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism – even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eugene V. Debs:Citizen and Socialist |last=Salvatore |first=Nick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1982 |publisher=Illini Books |location= |isbn=}}</ref> It has been said, that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be; fierce in his convictions, but kind and compassionate in his personal relations.<ref>Gillespie, J. David. "Doctrinal Parties 1: The Socialists and Communists." Challengers to Duopoly: Why Third Parties Matter in American Two-party Politics. Columbia, SC:U of South Carolina, 2012. page 176. Print.</ref> As [[Heywood Broun]] noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: "That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around I believe it myself."<ref>[http://www.jimmcguiggan.com/reflections3.asp?status=Jesus&id=933 Jesus and Eugene Debs] Jim McGuiggan.

===Arrest and imprisonment===
{{Wikisource|Debs' Speech of Sedition}}
[[File:Debs, Eastman, Rose Pastor Strokes.jpg|thumb|right|Debs with [[Max Eastman]] and [[Rose Pastor Stokes]] in 1918]]

Debs' speeches against the Wilson administration and the war earned the enmity of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who later called Debs a "traitor to his country."<ref name="Noggle">[[Burl Noggle]], ''Into the Twenties: The United States form Armistice to Normalcy'' (University of Illinois Press, 1974), 113</ref> On June 16, 1918, Debs made a speech in [[Canton, Ohio]], urging resistance to the military draft of [[World War I]]. He was arrested on June 30 and charged with ten counts of [[sedition]].

His trial defense called no witnesses, asking that Debs be allowed to address the court in his defense. That unusual request was granted, and Debs spoke for two hours. He was found guilty on September 12. At his sentencing hearing on September 14, he again addressed the court, and his speech has become a classic. [[Heywood Broun]], a liberal journalist and not a Debs partisan, said it was "one of the most beautiful and moving passages in the English language. He was for that one afternoon touched with inspiration. If anyone told me that tongues of fire danced upon his shoulders as he spoke, I would believe it."<ref>David Pietrusza, ''1920: The Year of Six Presidents.'' New York: Carroll and Graf, 2007; pp. 267–269.</ref>

Debs said in part:<ref>Pietrusza, ''1920,'' pp. 269–270</ref>

::Your honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the form of our present government; that I am opposed to the social system in which we live; that I believe in the change of both but by perfectly peaceable and orderly means....

::I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and factories; I am thinking of the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of [[Mammon]], and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....

::Your honor, I ask no mercy, I plead for no immunity. I realize that finally the right must prevail. I never more fully comprehended than now the great struggle between the powers of greed on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of freedom. I can see the dawn of a better day of humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come into their own.

::When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eyes toward the [[Southern Cross]], burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches the Southern Cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of Time upon the dial of the universe; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the look-out knows that the midnight is passing{{spaced ndash}}that relief and rest are close at hand.

::Let the people take heart and hope everywhere, for the cross is bending, midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning.

Debs was sentenced on November 18, 1918, to ten years in prison. He was also [[disenfranchised]] for life.<ref name=time/> Debs presented what has been called his best-remembered statement at his sentencing hearing:<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1918/court.htm Statement to the Court Upon Being Convicted of Violating the Sedition Act] Marxists. Retrieved July 21, 2008.</ref>

::Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.

Debs appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on ''[[Debs v. United States]]'', the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding [[World War I]] and [[socialism]]. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches in an attempt to comply with the [[Espionage Act]], the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially the same as that of ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.

Debs went to prison on April 13, 1919.<ref name=bio/> In protest of his jailing, [[Charles Ruthenberg]] led a parade of [[Trade union|unionists]], [[socialism|socialists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]] and [[communism|communists]] to march on May 1 ([[May Day]]) 1919, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. The event quickly broke into the violent [[May Day Riots of 1919]].

Debs ran for president in the 1920 election while in prison in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He received 919,799<ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=The American Pageant|year=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|pages=716}}</ref> write-in votes (3.4%),<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h890.html| title=Election of 1920| accessdate=2009-09-19| work=Travel and History}}</ref> slightly less than he had won in 1912, when he received 6%, the highest number of votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S.<ref name=bio/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h887.html| title=Election of 1912| accessdate=2009-09-19| work=Travel and History}}</ref> During his time in prison, Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system. They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, ''Walls and Bars'', with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.<ref name=time/>

In March 1919, President Wilson asked Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer]] for his opinion on clemency, offering his own: "I doubt the wisdom and public effect of such an action." Palmer generally favored releasing people convicted under the wartime security acts, but when he consulted with Debs' prosecutors – even those with records as defenders of civil liberties – they assured him that Debs' conviction was correct and his sentence appropriate.<ref>Stanley Coben, ''A. Mitchell Palmer: Politician'' (NY: Columbia University Press, 1963), 200–3</ref> The President and his Attorney General both believed that public opinion opposed clemency and that releasing Debs could strengthen Wilson's opponents in the [[Treaty of Versailles#United States rejects Treaty|debate over the ratification of the peace treaty]]. Palmer proposed clemency in August and October 1920 without success.<ref>Coben, 202</ref>

At one point, Wilson wrote: 
<blockquote>"While the flower of American youth was pouring out its blood to vindicate the cause of civilization, this man, Debs, stood behind the lines sniping, attacking, and denouncing them....This man was a traitor to his country and he will never be pardoned during my administration."<ref name="Noggle"/></blockquote>

In January 1921, Palmer, citing Debs' deteriorating health, proposed to Wilson that Debs receive a presidential pardon freeing him on February 12, Lincoln's birthday. Wilson returned the paperwork after writing "Denied" across it.<ref>Ginger, ''Bending Cross'', 405</ref>

[[File:Eugene Debs released from prison, 1921.jpg|thumb|Debs leaving the federal penitentiary in Atlanta on Christmas Day 1921, following commutation of his sentence]]

On December 23, 1921, President [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] commuted Debs' sentence to time served, effective Christmas Day. He did not issue a pardon. A White House statement summarized the administration's view of Debs' case: 
<blockquote>"There is no question of his guilt....He was by no means as rabid and outspoken in his expressions as many others, and but for his prominence and the resulting far-reaching effect of his words, very probably might not have received the sentence he did. He is an old man, not strong physically. He is a man of much personal charm and impressive personality, which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent."<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Harding Frees Debs and 23 Others Held for War Violations |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE2D71539E133A25757C2A9649D946095D6CF |publisher=New York Times |date=December 24, 1921 |accessdate=2010-03-03 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 1924, Debs was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by the Finnish [[Socialist]] [[Karl H. Wiik]] on the grounds that "Debs started to work actively for peace during World War I, mainly because he considered the war to be in the interest of capitalism."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/nomination/nomination.php?action=show&showid=1347| title=The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Peace, 1901–1955| accessdate=2006-04-21| author=Nobel Foundation|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929133041/http://nobelprize.org/peace/nomination/nomination.php?action=show&showid=1347 |archivedate = September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  In late 1926, Debs was admitted to [[Henry Lindlahr|Lindlahr]] [[sanatorium|Sanitarium]] in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]].<ref name=time/> He died there of [[heart failure]] on October 20, 1926, at the age of 70.<ref name=obit/> His body was [[Cremation|cremated]] and buried in [[Highland Lawn Cemetery]].<ref name="debsfoundation">{{cite web|url=http://debsfoundation.org/personalhistory.html|title=Debs Foundation| accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>

== Legacy ==

Eugene Debs helped motivate the [[American Left]] as a measure of political opposition to [[corporations]] and [[World War I]]. American socialists, communists, and anarchists honor his compassion for the labor movement and motivation to have the average working man build socialism without large state involvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Heroes/EugeneDebsSocialism.html |title=Eugene V. Debs hero |publisher=Thirdworldtraveler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> Several books have been written about his life as an inspirational American socialist.

On May 22, 1962, [[Eugene V. Debs Home|Debs' home]] was purchased by the Eugene V. Debs Foundation for $9,500, which worked to preserve it as a Debs memorial was begun. In 1965 it was designated as an official historic site of the state of Indiana, and in 1966 it was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] of the United States. The preservation of the museum is monitored by the [[National Park Service]]. In 1990, the U.S. Department of Labor named Debs a member of its [[Labor Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606053811/http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/laborhall/1990_debs.htm |title=U.S. Department of Labor – Labor Hall of Fame – Eugene V. Debs |publisher=United States Department of Labor |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>

While Debs did not leave a collection of papers to a university library, the pamphlet collection which he and his brother amassed is held by [[Indiana State University]] in [[Terre Haute]]. The scholar Bernard Brommel, author of a 1978 biography of Debs, has donated his biographical research materials to the [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago, where they are open to researchers.<ref>Alison Hinderliter,[http://www.newberry.org/collections/FindingAids/brommeldebs/BrommelDebs.html "Inventory of the Bernard J.
