==Company history==
{{Main|History of YouTube}}
[[File:Youtube founders.jpg|thumb|400px|From left to right: [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]]]]
YouTube was founded by [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]], who were all early employees of [[PayPal]].<ref name="usatoday">{{Cite news| url = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-11-21-video-websites_x.htm | title = Video websites pop up, invite postings | work = USA Today | date = November 21, 2005 | accessdate =July 28, 2006 | last = Graham | first = Jefferson}}</ref> Hurley had studied design at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], and Chen and Karim studied [[computer science]] together at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube: Sharing Digital Camera Videos |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]| url =http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126|accessdate=November 29, 2008 }}</ref>

According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible".<ref name = "time">{{Cite news| title=The Gurus of YouTube|author=Cloud, John|work=Time Magazine| url =http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1570721,00.html|accessdate=November 29, 2008 | date=December 16, 2006}}</ref>

Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from [[Janet Jackson]]'s role in the 2004 [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl incident]], when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site.<ref>{{cite web| title = Surprise!

YouTube offered the public a [[beta test]] of the site in May 2005, six months before the official launch in November 2005.

Supported browsers include [[Google Chrome]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 8]], and [[Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer 11]].<ref name="default_html5">{{Cite news| url =http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/youtube-declares-html5-video-ready-for-primetime-makes-it-default/ |first=Ron|last=Amadeo |title = YouTube says HTML5 video ready for primetime, makes it default | work = Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015| accessdate =January 29, 2015}}</ref>

YouTube experimented with [[Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP]] (MPEG-DASH), which is an adaptive bit-rate HTTP-based streaming solution optimizing the bitrate and quality for the available network.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rajeev Tiwari |url=http://streamingcodecs.blogspot.hu/2013/01/mpeg-dash-support-in-youtube.html |title=Streaming Media and RTOS: MPEG-DASH Support in Youtube |publisher=Streamingcodecs.blogspot.hu |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref> Currently they are using [[Adaptive bitrate streaming#Adobe Dynamic Streaming for Flash|Adobe Dynamic Streaming for Flash]].<ref>{{youtube|UklDSMG9ffU|YouTube: Google I/O 2013 - Adaptive Streaming for You and YouTube}}</ref>

====Uploading====
All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users who have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone.<ref>[http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=71673 Video length for uploading] YouTube Help. Retrieved April 17, 2012.</ref> When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload long videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.<ref>{{cite web| title =YouTube caps video lengths to reduce infringement|author=Fisher, Ken| publisher = Ars Technica| url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060329-6481.html|accessdate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="longer">{{cite web| title =Account Types: Longer videos| publisher = YouTube| url=http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=71673&ctx=sibling|accessdate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.<ref name="15min">{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20012090-248.html|title=YouTube bumps video limit to 15 minutes|date=July 29, 2010|first=Josh|last=Lowensohn|publisher=CNET|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref> If an up-to-date browser version is used, videos greater than 20 [[gigabyte|GB]] can be uploaded.<ref>[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71673?rd=1 "Upload videos longer than 15 minutes"].

YouTube accepts videos uploaded in most [[Container format (digital)|container formats]], including [[Audio Video Interleave|.AVI]], [[Matroska|.MKV]], [[QuickTime|.MOV]], [[MPEG-4 Part 14|.MP4]], [[DivX]], [[Flash Video|.FLV]], and [[Theora|.ogg]] and [[Theora|.ogv]]. These include video formats such as [[MPEG-4]], [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]], [[VOB]], and [[Windows Media Video|.WMV]]. It also supports [[3GP and 3G2|3GP]], allowing videos to be uploaded from mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web| title =Video Formats: File formats| publisher = YouTube| url=http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=55744&topic=10526|accessdate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> Videos with [[progressive scan]]ning or interlaced scanning can be uploaded, but for the best video quality, YouTube suggests interlaced videos be [[Deinterlacing|deinterlaced]] before uploading.

====Quality and formats====
YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320×240 [[pixel]]s using the [[Sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]] codec (a variant of [[H.263]]),<ref name="incomplete-h263">{{cite web|url=http://www.kaourantin.net/2005/08/quest-for-new-video-codec-in-flash-8.html|title=The quest for a new video codec in Flash 8 |author=Tinic Uro |quote=We went this route before with Sorenson Spark which is an incomplete implementation of H.263 and it bit us badly when trying to implement certain solutions. |date=August 13, 2005 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref><ref name="flash-video">{{cite web |url=http://download.macromedia.com/f4v/video_file_format_spec_v10_1.pdf |title=Adobe Flash Video File Format Specification Version 10.1 |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |format=PDF |page=72 |quote=Sorenson H.263 |year=2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> with mono MP3 audio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sorensonmedia.com/news/?n=379|title=Market Demand for Sorenson Media's Sorenson Spark Video Decoder Expands Sharply|publisher=Sorenson Media|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}</ref> In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in [[3GP and 3G2|3GP]] format on mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/06/17/youtube-mobile-goes-live/|title=YouTube Mobile goes live|date=June 17, 2007|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2008/03/youtube-videos-in-high-quality.html|title=YouTube Blog&nbsp;– YouTube Videos in High Quality|date=March 24, 2008|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=April 4, 2009}}</ref>

In November 2008, [[720p]] [[high-definition video|HD]] support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a [[4:3]] [[aspect ratio]] to a [[widescreen]] [[16:9]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10104182-2.html?tag=mncol;txt|title=YouTube videos go HD with a simple hack|work=CNET|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] as its default video compression format. In November 2009, [[1080p]] HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in [[4K resolution|4K]] format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/whats-bigger-than-1080p-4k-video-comes.html |title=What's bigger than 1080p? 4K video comes to YouTube |publisher=Official YouTube Blog|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20010174-248.html|title=YouTube now supports 4k-resolution videos|publisher=CNET|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2010|first=Josh|last=Lowensohn}}</ref> YouTube has since lowered the maximum resolution to 3840×2160 pixels, which is twice as many pixels in both directions as [[1080p]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en|title=Advanced encoding settings - YouTube Help|work=Google|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

In June 2014, YouTube introduced videos playing at 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], in order to reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to high-end [[Video card|graphics cards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://youtubecreator.blogspot.nl/2014/06/look-ahead-creator-features-coming-to.html|title=Look ahead: creator features coming to YouTube|work=The Official YouTube Partners & Creators Blog|date=June 26, 2014|first=Matthew|last=Glotzbach}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/27/battlefield-hardline-youtube-trailers-games|title=Battlefield Hardline ushers in era of smooth YouTube trailers|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 27, 2014|accessdate=June 29, 2014|first=Keith|last=Stuart}}</ref> The videos play back at a resolution of 720p or higher.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/29/60-fps-youtube/|title=YouTube Can Now Play Videos At A Buttery 60 Frames Per Second|date=October 29, 2014|first=Greg|last=Kumparak}}</ref>

YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ) and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the [[VP9]] format with stereo [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports [[Windows XP]], then [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] video with stereo [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio is used instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/109102513|title=Deploying VP9 at YouTube: a postmortem - Steven Robertson|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}</ref>

====3D videos====
In a video posted on July 21, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ANcspdYh_U|title=YouTube in 3D|publisher=YouTube|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref> YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload [[3D film|3D videos]]. The videos can be viewed in several different ways, including the common [[anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/news167575864.html|title=YouTube in 3D?|work=Physorg|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009|first=Miranda|last=Marquit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://techie-buzz.com/video-tools/youtube-3d-videos.html|title=YouTube 3D Videos|date=July 20, 2009|work=Techie Buzz|first=Keith|last=Dsouza|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thinkdigit.com/Internet/YouTube-adds-a-dimension-3D-goggles-not_3219.html|title=YouTube adds a dimension, 3D goggles not included|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009|work=thinkdigit|first=Kshitij|last=Sobti}}</ref> The YouTube [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or [[anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination.

===Content accessibility===
YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of [[HTML]] that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube embedded video guide|url=http://www.athenswalk.net/_/Blog/Entries/2013/7/30_YouTube_embed_code_guide.html}}</ref> This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in [[social networking]] pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by or related to another user's video are able to make a "video response". On August 27, 2013, YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature.<ref name="responses">{{cite web|url=http://youtubecreator.blogspot.ca/2013/08/so-long-video-responsesnext-up-better.html|title=So long, video responses...

====Platforms====
Most modern [[smartphone]]s are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] streaming for the video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.youtube.com/|title=YouTube Mobile}}</ref> Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/06/mobile-youtube.html|title=Mobile YouTube|author=Google Operating System|date=June 15, 2007|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref>

Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including [[Apple TV]], [[iPod Touch]] and the [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/20youtube.html|title=YouTube Live on Apple TV Today; Coming to iPhone on June 29|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref> In July 2010, the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on [[HTML5]], avoiding the need to use [[Adobe Flash Player]] and optimized for use with touch screen controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/goodbye-flash-youtube-mobile-goes-html5-on-iphone-and-android-2010079/|title=Goodbye Flash: YouTube mobile goes HTML5 on iPhone and Android|author=Zibreg, Christian|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref> The mobile version is also available as an [[Mobile app|app]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/07/youtube-iphone-mobile-html5/|title=YouTube Mobile Goes HTML5, Video Quality Beats Native Apps Hands Down|author=Kincaid, Jason|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/12/youtube-21-app-now-available-on-android.html|title=YouTube 2.1 App Now Available on Android Market|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref> In September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and [[iOS]] 6 operating system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/11/youtube-iphone-app|title=New YouTube iPhone app preempts iOS6 demotion|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=September 11, 2012|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], YouTube was used by 35% of [[smartphone]] users between April and June 2013, making it the third most used app.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/google-smartphone-app-popularity-2013-9#infographic |title=Google+ Is The Fourth Most-Used Smartphone App |author=Cooper Smith |work=Business Insider |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British [[Royalties|royalty]] collection agency [[PRS for Music]] led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom.

During the same court battle, Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 [[terabyte]]s of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site. The decision was criticized by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], which called the court ruling "a setback to privacy rights".<ref name=privacy_bbc>{{Cite journal |title=Google must divulge YouTube log |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7488009.stm |date=July 3, 2008 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Google Told to Turn Over User Data of YouTube |last=Helft |first=Miguel |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/technology/04youtube.html |date=July 4, 2008}}</ref> In June 2010, Viacom's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a [[summary judgment]], with U.S. federal Judge [[Louis L.

In August 2008, a US court ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected [[fair use]] of the material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song "[[Let's Go Crazy]]", and posted the 29-second video on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite news|first= Bob|last= Egelko|title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/20/MNU412FKRL.DTL |quote= |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=August 25, 2008 }}</ref>

In April 2012, a court in [[Hamburg]] ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users. The performance rights organization [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] argued that YouTube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of German copyrighted music. YouTube responded by stating:

{{Cquote|''We remain committed to finding a solution to the music licensing issue in Germany that will benefit artists, composers, authors, publishers and record labels, as well as the wider YouTube community''.<ref>{{Cite news| title = YouTube loses court battle over music clips|work=[[BBC News]] |location=London| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17785613|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=April 20, 2012 }}</ref>}}

As of 2013, YouTube and GEMA have still not reached a licensing agreement. As a result, most videos containing copyrighted music have been blocked in Germany since 2009.

In April 2013, it was reported that [[Universal Music Group]] and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] counter-notice. When a dispute occurs, the uploader of the video has to contact UMG.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/youtube-deal-with-universal-blocks-dmca-counter-notices-130405/ |title=YouTube's Deal With Universal Blocks DMCA Counter Notices |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=3045545 |title=Videos removed or blocked due to YouTube's contractual obligations |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

====Content ID====
In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe [[copyright]]. The system was regarded by Google CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from [[Viacom]], which alleged that YouTube profited from pirated content.<ref>{{Cite news|first= Kevin J.|last= Delaney|title=YouTube to Test Software To Ease Licensing Fights |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118161295626932114.html|quote= |work=Wall Street Journal |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 4, 2011 }}</ref> The system, which became known as Content ID, creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.<ref name="youtube">[http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid_more More about Content ID] YouTube. Retrieved December 4, 2011.</ref>

When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video. YouTube describes Content ID as "very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File".<ref name="youtube" /> Content ID accounts for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics Press Statistics] YouTube. Retrieved March 13, 2012.</ref>

An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube, and concluded that while the system was "surprisingly resilient" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testing YouTube's Audio Content ID System|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/testing-youtubes-aud|date=April 23, 2009|author=Von Lohmann, Fred|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for [[fair use]].<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube's January Fair Use Massacre|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/01/youtubes-january-fair-use-massacre|date=February 3, 2009|author=Von Lohmann, Fred|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid_dispute Content ID disputes] YouTube.

===Controversial content===
{{see also|Criticism of Google#YouTube|Censorship by Google#YouTube}}
YouTube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos. The uploading of videos containing [[defamation]], pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is prohibited by YouTube's [[terms of service]].<ref name="guidelines">{{cite web| url = http://youtube.com/t/community_guidelines| title = YouTube Community Guidelines | publisher = YouTube| accessdate =November 30, 2008}}</ref> Controversial content has included that pertaining to [[Holocaust denial]] and the [[Hillsborough disaster]], in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.<ref>{{cite web| title =YouTube criticized in Germany over anti-Semitic Nazi videos| publisher = Reuters| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/898004.html|accessdate=May 28, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Fury as YouTube carries sick Hillsboro video insult| publisher = icLiverpool| url = http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=fury-as-youtube-carries-sick-hillsboro-video-insult%26method=full%26objectid=18729523%26page=1%26siteid=50061-name_page.html|accessdate=May 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>

YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's terms of service.<ref name="guidelines"/> In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] stated that it was "unimpressed" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that "proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting [[user-generated content]]". YouTube responded by stating:

{{Cquote|''We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly''.<ref>{{Cite news| title =YouTube attacked by MPs over sex and violence footage|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/07/31/dlyoutube131.xml|accessdate=August 21, 2008  | first1=James | last1=Kirkup | first2=Nicole | last2=Martin | date=July 31, 2008}}</ref> (July 2008)}}

===User comments===
{{See also |Criticism of Google#YouTube user comments}}

Most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the [[Troll (Internet)|negative]] aspects of both their form and content. In 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' praised [[Web 2.0]] for enabling "community and collaboration on a scale never seen before", and added that YouTube "harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html "Time's Person of the Year: You"], ''Time'', December 13, 2006</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:

On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a [[Google+]] account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented. The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/youtube-comments-trolls-moderation-google "YouTube aims to tame the trolls with changes to its comments section"], Stuart Dredge, ''The Guardian'', November 7, 2013.

''Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation.

===View counts===
In December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's [[terms of service]], which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts.

==Censorship and filtering==
{{Main|Censorship of YouTube}}

As of September 2012, countries with standing national bans on YouTube include [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]].

YouTube is blocked for a variety of reasons, including:<ref name=ONIYouTubeCensored>[http://opennet.net/youtube-censored-a-recent-history "YouTube Censored: A Recent History"], OpenNet Initiative. Retrieved September 23, 2012.</ref>
* limiting public exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest;
* preventing criticism of a ruler, government, government officials, religion, or religious leaders;
* violations of national laws, including:
** [[copyright]] and [[intellectual property]] protection laws;
** violations of [[hate speech]], ethics, or morality-based laws; and
** [[national security]] legislation.
* preventing access to videos judged to be inappropriate for youth;
* reducing distractions at work or school; and
* reducing the amount of network bandwidth used.

In some countries, YouTube is completely blocked, either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.<ref name=ONIYouTubeCensored/>

Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's inevitable potential for distraction.<ref name=ONIYouTubeCensored/>

===Music Key licensing===
In May 2014, prior to the launch of YouTube's subscription-based Music Key service, the [[independent music]] trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were "undervalued" in comparison to other streaming services, and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service. In a statement to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service "to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms." Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that "while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience."<ref name=verge-blockmusic>{{cite web|title=YouTube will block videos from artists who don't sign up for its paid streaming service|url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817408/youtube-reportedly-block-videos-indie-artists|website=The Verge|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian-musicpass>{{cite news|title=YouTube subscription music licensing strikes wrong notes with indie labels|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/22/indie-labels-youtube-subscription-music|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian-stall>{{cite news|title=Talks with indie labels stall over YouTube music subscription service|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/23/talks-indie-labels-stall-youtube-music-subscription-service|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian-indieblock>{{cite news|title=YouTube to block indie labels who don't sign up to new music service|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/youtube-indie-labels-music-subscription|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> The ''Financial Times'' later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with [[Merlin Network]]—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service.
