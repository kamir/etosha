'''Joseph Leo Mankiewicz''' (February 11, 1909 – February 5, 1993) was a film director, screenwriter, and producer. Mankiewicz had a long Hollywood career, and twice won the [[Academy Award]] for both [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay]], for ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949) and ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950).

==Early life==
Joseph Mankiewicz was born in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] to Franz Mankiewicz (died 1941) and Johanna Blumenau, Jewish immigrants from Germany.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives|year=1998|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|quote=Mankiewicz was the youngest of three children born to the German immigrants Franz Mankiewicz, a secondary schoolteacher, and Johanna Blumenau, a homemaker.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FVUYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Franz+Mankiewicz%22&dq=%22Franz+Mankiewicz%22&pgis=1|isbn=0-684-80620-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Joseph L.

At age four, Mankiewicz moved with his family to New York City where he graduated in 1924 from [[Stuyvesant High School]].<ref name=nytobit/> In 1928, he obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. For a time he worked in [[Berlin]], Germany, as a foreign correspondent for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper before entering the motion picture business.

==Hollywood career==
Comfortable in a variety of genres and able to elicit career performances from actors and actresses alike, Joseph L. Mankiewicz combined ironic, sophisticated scripts with a precise, sometimes stylised [[mise en scène]]. Mankiewicz worked for seventeen years as a screenwriter for [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]] and as a producer for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] before getting a chance to direct at [[Twentieth Century-Fox]]. Over six years he made 11 films for Fox, reaching a peak in 1950 and 1951 when he won consecutive [[Academy Awards]] for Screenplay and Direction for both ''A Letter to Three Wives'' and ''All About Eve'', which was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won six.

During his long career in Hollywood, Mankiewicz wrote forty-eight screenplays. He also produced more than twenty films including ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1941. However, he is best known for the films he directed, twice winning the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. In 1944, he produced ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom (film)|The Keys of the Kingdom]]'', which starred [[Gregory Peck]], and featured Mankiewicz's then-wife, Rose Stradner, in a supporting role as a nun.

In 1951 Mankiewicz left Fox and moved to New York, intending to write for the Broadway stage. Although this dream never materialised, he continued to make films (both for his own production company Figaro and as a director-for-hire) that explored his favourite themes – the clash of aristocrat with commoner, life as performance and the clash between people's urge to control their fate and the contingencies of real life.
{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1953 he directed ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' for [[MGM]], an adaptation of Shakespeare's play. It received widely favorable reviews, and [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]], in ''The Story of Cinema'', described it as a "film of quiet excellence, faltering only in the later moments when budget restrictions hampered the handling of the battle sequences".<ref>David Shipman ''The Story of Cinemas, Volume 2: From "Citizen Kane to the Present Day'', London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1984, p.852</ref> The film serves as the only record of [[Marlon Brando]] in a Shakespearean role; he played [[Mark Antony]], and received an Oscar nomination for his performance.

In 1958 Mankiewicz directed ''[[The Quiet American (1958 film)|The Quiet American]]'', an adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s 1955 [[The Quiet American|novel]] about the seed of American military involvement in what would become the [[Vietnam War]]. Mankiewicz, under career pressure from the climate of [[anti-Communism]] and the [[Hollywood blacklist]], distorted the message of Greene's book, changing major parts of the story to appeal to a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] audience. A cautionary tale about America's blind support for "anti-Communists" was turned into, according to Greene, a "propaganda film for America".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/14/thriller-ridley-scott | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=An offer they couldn't refuse | first=Matthew | last=Alford | date=November 14, 2008}}</ref>

''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' consumed two years of Mankiewicz's life and ended up both derailing his career and causing extreme severe financial losses for the studio, [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], which were not fully recovered until [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s immensely popular and acclaimed ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' was released two years later. Mankiewicz made more films, however, garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Direction in 1972 for ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'', his final directing effort, starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Michael Caine]].  In 1983, he was a member of the jury at the [[33rd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1983/04_jury_1983/04_Jury_1983.html |title=Berlinale: 1983 Juries |accessdate=November 14, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

==Family history==
He was the younger brother of [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]]. His sons are Eric Reynal (from his first marriage), the late writer/director [[Tom Mankiewicz]], and producer Christopher Mankiewicz. He also has a daughter, Alex Mankiewicz. His great-nephew is radio & television personality [[Ben Mankiewicz]], who currently can be seen on [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]. He also was the uncle of [[Frank Mankiewicz]], a well-known political campaign manager who officially announced the death of the assassinated presidential candidate, [[Robert F. Kennedy]], in 1968.  He was not related to the similar sounding British screenwriter, [[Wolf Mankowitz]].

==Death==
Mankiewicz died of a heart attack on February 5, 1993, six days before his 84th birthday, and was interred in Saint Matthew's Episcopal Churchyard cemetery, [[Bedford (CDP), New York|Bedford]], New York.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D9113AF935A35751C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|date=February 6, 1993|title=Joseph L.
