The '''Tea Party movement''' is an American political movement known for its [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions and its role in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party ("GOP")]].  It demands a reduction in the [[United States public debt|U.S. national debt]] and [[federal budget deficit]] by reducing government [[United States federal budget|spending]] and [[Taxation in the United States|taxes]].<ref name="Gallup">[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/107193-gallup-tea-partys-top-concerns-are-debt-size-of-government Gallup: Tea Party's top concerns are debt, size of government] ''The Hill'', July 5, 2010</ref><ref name="thefiscaltimes.com">Somashekhar, Sandhya (September 12, 2010).

The origins of the current Tea Party movement can be traced back to circa 2007. The movement's beginnings were kick-started by Republican Congressman Dr. [[Ron Paul]] in 2007. His GOP presidential campaign received a 24-hour, record breaking, money bomb on December 16, 2007;<ref>Ron Paul's Tea Party-- a bigger money bomb (2007).http://www.cnet.com/news/ron-pauls-tea-party-a-bigger-money-bomb/</ref> which is the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.

==Agenda==
{{Main|Contract from America}}
{{See also|Politics of the United States}}
The Tea Party does not have a single uniform agenda. The decentralized character of the Tea Party, with its lack of formal structure or hierarchy, allows each autonomous group to set its own priorities and goals. Goals may conflict, and priorities will often differ between groups. Many Tea Party organizers see this as a strength rather than a weakness, as decentralization has helped to immunize the Tea Party against co-opting by outside entities and corruption from within.<ref name="Rauch1">"Group Think: Inside the Tea Party’s Collective Brain"; National Journal; Jonathan Rauch; September 11, 2010</ref><br>

The Tea Party has generally sought to avoid placing too much emphasis on traditional conservative social issues. National Tea Party organizations, such as the [[Tea Party Patriots]] and [[FreedomWorks]], have expressed concern that engaging in social issues would be divisive.<ref name="Rauch1"/> Instead, they have sought to have activists focus their efforts away from social issues and focus on economic and limited government issues.<ref name="AssocPress">[http://www.ktvb.com/news/politics/82725622.html Tea Partiers shaking up races across country]; KTVB News; January 28, 2010</ref><ref name="nytimes.com">{{Cite news

The Tea Party generally focuses on government reform, including a significant reduction in the size and scope of the government. Tea Party members generally advocate a national economy operating without government oversight.<ref>"Economic Freedom | Tea Party Patriots." Tea Party Patriots. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 June 2014. <http://www.teapartypatriots.org/economic-freedom/>.</ref> Among its goals are limiting the size of the federal government, reducing government spending, lowering the national debt and opposing tax increases.<ref name="Foley1">[[Elizabeth Price Foley]], law professor at [[Florida International University]] College of Law, writing on the Tea Party's proclamations regarding the Constitution, observed: "Tea Party opposition to bailouts, stimulus packages and health-care reform is reflected in various proposals to amend the Constitution, including proposals to require a balanced budget, repeal the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments, and give states a veto power over federal laws (the so-called Repeal Amendment)." (Foley, Elizabeth Price. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1904656 "Sovereignty, Rebalanced: The Tea Party and Constitutional Amendments."] ''Tennessee Law Review,'' Vol. 78, p. 751. August 3, 2011.)</ref> To this end, Tea Party groups have protested the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP), stimulus programs such as the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA, commonly referred to as the Stimulus or The Recovery Act), [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], health care reform such as the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA, also known simply as the Affordable Care Act or "[[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Term "Obamacare"|Obamacare]]") and perceived attacks by the federal government on their 1st, 2nd, 4th and 10th Amendment rights.<ref name="Zernike1">Kate Zernike, a national correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]],'' wrote: "It could be hard to define a Tea Party agenda; to some extent it depended on where you were. In the Northeast, groups mobilized against high taxes; in the Southwest, illegal immigration. Some Tea Partiers were clearer about what they didn't want than what they did. But the shared ideology — whether for young libertarians who came to the movement through Ron Paul or older 9/12ers who came to it through Glenn Beck — was the belief that a strict interpretation of the Constitution was the solution to government grown wild. [...] By getting back to what the founders intended, they believed they could right what was wrong with the country. Where in the Constitution, they asked, does it say that the federal government was supposed to run banks? Or car companies? Where does it say that people have to purchase health insurance? Was it so much to ask that officials honor the document they swear an oath to uphold?" (Zernike, Kate.

One attempt at forming a list of what Tea Partiers wanted Congress to do resulted in the ''[[Contract from America]]''.  It was a legislative agenda created by conservative activist Ryan Hecker with the assistance of [[Dick Armey]] of FreedomWorks. Armey had co-written the previous [[Contract with America]] released by the Republican Party during the 1994 midterm elections. One thousand agenda ideas that had been submitted were narrowed down to twenty-one non-social issues. Participants then voted in an online campaign in which they were asked to select their favorite policy planks. The results were released as a ten-point Tea Party platform.<ref name="Davis">{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tea-party-activists-craft-contract-america/story?id=9740705|title=Tea Party Activists Craft 'Contract from America'|last=Davis|first=Teddy|date=9 February 2010|work=ABC News|publisher=American Broadcasting Company|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="Davis2">{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Teddy |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tea-party-activists-unveil-contract-america/story?id=10376437&page=2 |title=Tea Party Activists Unveil 'Contract from America' |publisher=ABC News |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> The Contract from America was met with some support within the Republican Party, but it was not broadly embraced by GOP leadership, which released its own '[[Pledge to America]]'.<ref name="Davis2"/>

In the aftermath of the [[United States elections, 2012|2012 American elections]], some Tea Party activists have taken up more traditionally populist ideological viewpoints on issues that are distinct from general conservative views. Examples are various Tea Party demonstrators sometimes coming out in favor of [[Immigration reform|U.S. immigration reform]] as well as for raising the [[Minimum wage in the United States|U.S. minimum wage]].<ref name=star/>

===Foreign policy===
{{see also|Foreign policy of the United States}}

Historian and writer [[Walter Russell Mead]] analyzes the foreign policy views of the Tea Party movement in a 2011 essay published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. Mead says that [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] populists, such as the Tea Party, combine a belief in [[American exceptionalism]] and its role in the world with skepticism of American's "ability to create a liberal world order". When necessary, they favor '[[total war]]' and unconditional surrender over "limited wars for limited goals". Mead identifies two main trends, one somewhat personified by Paul and the other by Palin. "Paulites" have a [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] approach that seeks to avoid foreign military involvement. "Palinites", while seeking to avoid being drawn into unnecessary conflicts, favor a more aggressive response to maintaining America's primacy in international relations. Mead says that both groups share a distaste for "liberal internationalism".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Tea Party and American Foreign Policy: What Populism Means for Globalism |first =Walter Russell |last=Mead |authorlink=Walter Russell Mead |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67455/walter-russell-mead/the-tea-party-and-american-foreign-policy |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=March–April 2011 |pages=28–44}}</ref>

==Organization==
The Tea Party movement is composed of a loose affiliation of national and local groups that determine their own platforms and agendas without central leadership.

===Background===
In 1984, [[David H. Koch]] and [[Charles G. Koch]] of [[Koch Industries]] founded Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group whose self-described mission was "to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation." Congressman [[Ron Paul]] was appointed as the first chairman of the organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.ku.edu/paul/RonPaulCitizensforaSoundEconomy.pdf|title=Citizens for a Sound Economy|publisher=[[Citizens for a Sound Economy]]|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> The CSE lobbied for policies favorable to corporations, particularly tobacco companies.<ref>[http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/11/documents-reveal-tobacco-companies-funded-their-own-tea-party-first/ Documents reveal tobacco companies funded their own ‘tea party’ first]; The Raw Story, February 11, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brendan-demelle/study-confirms-tea-party-_b_2663125.html Study Confirms Tea Party Was Created by Big Tobacco and Billionaire Koch Brothers], Brendan DeMelle, [[Huffington Post]], posted Feb 11, 2013, viewed Feb 14, 2012</ref>

Opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) has been consistent within the Tea Party movement.<ref name = tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/> Said law has been often referred to as 'Obamacare' by critics. This has been an aspect of an overall [[Political dissent|anti-government]] message throughout tea party [[rhetoric]] that includes as well opposition to [[Gun control in the United States|gun control]] measures and to federal spending increases.<ref name=star/>

Activism by Tea Party people against the major health-care reform law from 2009 to 2014 has, according to the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', focused on pushing for Congressional victories so that a repeal measure would pass both houses and that President Obama's [[U.S. Presidential veto|veto]] could be overridden. Some conservative public officials and commentators such as columnist [[Ramesh Ponnuru]] have criticized these views as completely unrealistic with the chances of overriding a [[List of United States presidential vetoes|Presidential veto]] being slim, with Ponnuru stating that "If you have in 2017 a Republican government... and it doesn't get rid of Obamacare, then I think that is a huge political disaster".<ref name=star>{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2014/05/17/5030315/tea-party-is-losing-battles-but.html|publisher=''[[Kansas City Star]]''|accessdate=May 18, 2014|title=Tea party says it is winning the message war despite losing election battles|first=Dave|last=Helling|date=May 17, 2014}}</ref>

Aside from rallies, some groups affiliated with the Tea Party movement began to focus on getting out the vote and ground game efforts on behalf of candidates supportive of their agenda starting in the 2010 elections.

Various Tea Party groups have endorsed candidates in the elections.

In June 2014, Tea Party favorite [[Dave Brat]] unseated the sitting GOP [[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]]. Brat had previously been known as an [[economist]] and a professor at [[Randolph–Macon College]], running a grassroots conservative campaign that espoused greater fiscal restraint and his [[Milton Friedman]]-based viewpoints.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/who-david-brat-look-economics-professor-who-toppled-eric-cantor-1598240|title=Who Is David Brat?

Scott remarked to political commentator [[Glenn Beck]] that the tea party is neither [[Racism|racist]] nor [[Sexism|sexist]], and he also stated that he hoped to see more good-faith efforts to work together between the tea party and political factions in the future.

The Tea Party's involvement in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries|2012 GOP presidential primaries]] was minimal, owing to divisions over whom to endorse as well as lack of enthusiasm for all the candidates.<ref name="DBDec"/> Which is not to say the 2012 GOP ticket has not had an influence on the Tea Party: following the selection of [[Paul Ryan]] as [[Mitt Romney]]'s vice-presidential running mate, the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared that the once fringe of the conservative coalition, Tea Party lawmakers are now "indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party."<ref>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/ryan-brings-the-tea-party-to-the-ticket/?smid=tw-thecaucus&seid=auto Ryan Brings the Tea Party to the Ticket]; The New York Times; August 12, 2012; Retrieved August 13, 2012</ref>

In May 2013, the [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) inappropriately "flagged" Tea Party groups and other conservative groups for review of their applications for tax-exempt status during the 2012 election.

Some groups were asked for donor lists, which is usually a violation of IRS policy. Groups were also asked for details about family members and about their postings on social networking sites. [[Lois Lerner]], head of the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, apologized on behalf of the IRS and stated, "That was wrong.

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, rejected the apology as insufficient, demanding “ironclad guarantees from the I.R.S. that it will adopt significant protocols to ensure this kind of harassment of groups that have a constitutional right to express their own views never happens again.”<ref name="NYTIRS">Weisman, Jonathan.

Though the various polls sometimes turn up slightly different results, they tend to show that Tea Party supporters tend more likely than Americans overall to be [[White American|white]], male, married, older than 45, regularly attending religious services, conservative, and to be more wealthy and have more education.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?src=me&ref=general |title=Poll Finds Tea Party Backers Wealthier and More Educated |last=Zernike |first=Kate |author2=Megan Thee-Brenan  |date=April 14, 2010 |work=New York Times |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-timescbs-news-poll-national-survey-of-tea-party-supporters?ref=politics National Survey of Tea Party Supporters] ''New York Times''/CBS News Poll; April 14, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&-CONTEXT=dt&-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_B02001&-redoLog=true&-geo_id=01000US&-format=&-_lang=en&-SubjectID=15233308|title= Data Set: 2008 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |work=Survey: American Community Survey |author=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="vogel1">{{Cite news |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8E3F7732-18FE-70B2-A8C52111DA960902 |title=Poll: Tea Partiers Like GOP |first=Kenneth P. |last=Vogel |publisher=Politico |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="quinnipiac1">{{cite press release|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1436 |title=Tea Party Could Hurt GOP In Congressional Races, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Dems Trail 2-Way Races, But Win If Tea Party Runs |publisher=Quinnipiac University |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> Broadly speaking, multiple surveys have found between 10% and 30% of Americans identify as a member of the Tea Party movement.<ref name=realspin/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147635/tea-party-movement.aspx |title=Tea Party Movement &#124; Gallup Historical Trends |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref> Most Republicans and 20% of Democrats support the movement according to one Washington Post-ABC News poll.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuller |first=Jaime |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/28/what-shutdown-new-poll-shows-tea-party-support-remains-steady/ |title=What shutdown?

The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' has noted that Tea Party activists "have been called neo-Klansmen and knuckle-dragging hillbillies", adding that "demonizing tea party activists tends to energize the Democrats' left-of-center base" and that "polls suggest that tea party activists are not only more mainstream than many critics suggest,"<ref name=Jonsson040310>Patrik Jonsson, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0403/Amid-harsh-criticisms-tea-party-slips-into-the-mainstream "Amid harsh criticisms, 'tea party' slips into the mainstream"] ''Christian Science Monitor'', April 3, 2010

According to Susan Page and Naomi Jagoda of ''USA Today'' in 2010, the Tea Party was more "a frustrated state of mind" than "a classic political movement".<ref name = "PageNaomi">Page Susan; Jagoda Naomi (July 1, 2010).

===Polling of supporters===

An October 2010 ''Washington Post'' canvass of local Tea Party organizers found 99% said "concern about the economy" was an "important factor".<ref name="agwpostface"/>  Various polls have also probed Tea Party supporters for their views on a variety of political and controversial issues. On the question of whether they think their own income taxes this year are fair, 52% of Tea Party supporters told pollsters for [[CBS]]/''New York Times'' that they were, versus 62% in the general population (including Tea Party supporters).<ref name="nytimes1"/> A [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]] poll found that Tea Partiers are not against increased government action in all cases. "The ideas that find nearly universal agreement among Tea Party supporters are rather vague," says J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who created the survey. "You would think any idea that involves more government action would be anathema, and that is just not the case."

In advance of a new edition of their book ''American Grace'', political scientists David E. Campbell of Notre Dame and [[Robert D. Putnam]] of Harvard published in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' opinion the results of their research into the political attitudes and background of Tea Party supporters.  Using a pre-Tea Party poll in 2006 and going back to the same respondents in 2011, they found the supporters to be not "nonpartisan political neophytes" as often described, but largely "overwhelmingly partisan Republicans" who were politically active prior to the Tea Party.  The survey found Tea Party supporters "no more likely than anyone else" to have suffered hardship during the [[2007–present recession in the United States|2007–2010 recession]]. Additionally, the respondents were more concerned about "putting God in government" than with trying to shrink government.<ref>{{cite news|author=Campbell, David E. and Putnam, Robert D.|title=Crashing the Tea Party|date=August 16, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 17, 2011|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/opinion/crashing-the-tea-party.html}}</ref><ref name=God>David E.

The [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]] demonstrated considerable skepticism within the Tea Party movement with respect to the dangers and the reality of [[global warming]]. A ''New York Times''/CBS News Poll during the election revealed that only a small percentage of Tea Party supporters considered global warming a serious problem, much less than the portion of the general public that does. The Tea Party is strongly opposed to government-imposed limits on carbon dioxide emissions as part of [[emissions trading]] legislation to encourage use of fuels that emit less [[Carbon emissions|carbon dioxide]].<ref>John M.

==Commentary by the Obama administration==

On April 29, 2009, Obama commented on the Tea Party protests during a townhall meeting in [[Arnold, Missouri]]: "Let me just remind them that I am happy to have a serious conversation about how we are going to cut our health care costs down over the long term, how we're going to stabilize Social Security. Claire McCaskill and I are working diligently to do basically a thorough audit of federal spending. But let's not play games and pretend that the reason is because of the recovery act, because that's just a fraction of the overall problem that we've got. We are going to have to tighten our belts, but we're going to have to do it in an intelligent way. And we've got to make sure that the people who are helped are working American families, and we're not suddenly saying that the way to do this is to eliminate programs that help ordinary people and give more tax cuts to the wealthy. We tried that formula for eight years. It did not work. And I don't intend to go back to it."<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/29/obama_100_days_townhall_in_missouri_96272.html Obama's 100 Days Townhall in Missouri] [[Real Clear Politics]]; April 29, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/29/obama-responds-to-tea-party-movement/ Obama responds to tea party movement] CNN Political Ticker; April 29, 2009</ref>

On April 15, 2010, Obama noted the passage of 25 different tax cuts over the past year, including tax cuts for 95% of working Americans.

On September 20, 2010, at a townhall discussion sponsored by CNBC, Obama said healthy skepticism about government and spending was good, but it was not enough to just say "Get control of spending", and he challenged the Tea Party movement to get specific about how they would cut government debt and spending: "And so the challenge, I think, for the Tea Party movement is to identify specifically what would you do. It's not enough just to say, get control of spending. I think it's important for you to say, I'm willing to cut veterans' benefits, or I'm willing to cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, or I'm willing to see these taxes go up.

According to [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], a [[progressivism|progressive]] media watchdog, there is a disparity between large coverage of the Tea Party movement and minimal coverage of larger movements.

In April 2010, responding to a question from the media watchdog group [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] posed the previous week, [[Rupert Murdoch]], the chief executive of [[News Corporation]], which owns Fox News, said, "I don't think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party." That same week Fox News canceled an appearance by [[Sean Hannity]] at a [[Cincinnati]] Tea Party rally.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/us/17fox.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fox Canceled Hannity's Attendance at Tea Party's Tax Day Rally in Cincinnati |first=Brian |last=Stelter |date=April 16, 2010}}</ref>

Following the September 12 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], Fox News said it was the only cable news outlet to cover the emerging protests and took out full-page ads in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' with a prominent headline reading, "How did [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN miss this story?"<ref>{{cite web |last=Krakauer |first =Steve |title =Internal Fox News Email Addresses "Standards" After 9/12 Flap |publisher=Mediaite |date =September 21, 2009 |url =http://www.mediaite.com/tv/internal-fox-email-addresses-standards-after-912-flap/ |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref> CNN news anchor [[Rick Sanchez]] disputed Fox's assertion, pointing to various coverage of the event.<ref name="politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com">{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/18/networks-respond-to-false-fox-ad/ |title=Networks respond to false Fox ad |date=September 18, 2009 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0909/WaPo_defends_running_Fox_ad.html |title=WaPo defends running Fox ad |last=Calderone |first=Michael |date=September 18, 2009 |publisher=Politico |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="mediabistro.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/in_full_page_ad_fox_asks_where_were_other_media_on_912_the_answer_they_were_there_136133.asp?c=rss |title=In Full Page Ad, Fox Asks Where Were Other Media on 9/12.

In the January/February 2012 issue of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', [[Francis Fukuyama]] stated the Tea Party is supporting "politicians who serve the interests of precisely those [[financiers]] and [[corporate]] [[elites]] they claim to despise" and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] while comparing and contrasting it with the [[occupy movement]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136782/francis-fukuyama/the-future-of-history |title=The Future of History; Can Liberal Democracy Survive the Decline of the Middle Class? |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=January 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/blog/2012/01/06/francis-fukuyama-on-the-decline-of-the-middle-class/ |title=Francis Fukuyama on the decline of the middle class – PNHP's Official Blog |publisher=Pnhp.org |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2012}}</ref>

===Tea Party's views of media coverage===

In October 2010, a survey conducted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found that the majority of local Tea Party organizers consider the media coverage of their groups to be fair. Seventy-six percent of the local organizers said media coverage has been fair while 23 percent have said coverage was unfair. This was based on responses from all 647 local Tea Party organizers the ''Post'' was able to contact and verify, from a list of more than 1,400 possible groups identified.<ref name="agwpostmedia">Gardner, Amy [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/26/AR2010102602796.html "Tea party groups say media have been fair, survey finds"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 26, 2010.

Although the Tea Party has a libertarian element in terms of some issue convictions, most American libertarians do not support the movement enough to identify with it. A 2013 survey by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] (PRRI) found that 61% of identified libertarians stated they did not consider themselves part of the tea party. This split exists due to the strong [[Christian right]] influence in the movement, which puts the majority of the tea party movement at direct odds against libertarians on issues such as the [[war on drugs]] (with the aforementioned survey finding that 71% of libertarians support legalizing marijuana).<ref name=Richardson>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/29/libertarians-dont-call-us-tea-partyers-survey-find/?page=all Libertarians: Don’t call us tea partyers; survey finds blocs often clash]</ref> Some libertarian leaning supporters have grown increasingly annoyed by the influx of religious social issues into the movement. Many in the movement would prefer the complex social issues such as homosexuality, abortion, and religion to be left out of the discussion, while instead increasing the focus on limited government and states' rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

According to a review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' published in 2012, professor Ronald P. Formisano in ''The Tea Party: A Brief History'' provides an "even-handed perspective on and clarifying misconceptions about America’s recent political phenomenon" since "party supporters are not isolated zealots, and may, like other Americans, only want to gain control over their destinies". Professor Formisano sees underlying social roots and draws a parallel between the tea party movement and past support for independent candidate [[Ross Perot]],<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4214-0596-4 Publishers Weekly Reviewed on: 02/06/2012] ''The Tea Party: A Brief History'' (Ronald P.

==Controversy==
The final round of debate before voting on the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care bill]] was marked with vandalism and widespread threats of violence to at least ten Democratic lawmakers across the country, which created public relations problems for the fledgeling Tea Party movement. On March 22, 2010, in what the New York Times called "potentially the most dangerous of many acts of violence and threats against supporters of the bill," a [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] Tea Party organizer and the [[Danville, Virginia]] Tea Party Chairman both posted the home address of Representative [[Tom Perriello]]'s brother (mistakenly believing it was the Congressman's address) on their websites, and encouraged readers to "drop by" to express their anger against Representative Perriello's vote in favor of the healthcare bill. The following day, after smelling gas in his house, a severed gas line that connected to a [[propane tank]] was discovered on Perriello's brother's screened-in porch. Local police and [[FBI]] investigators determined that it was intentionally cut as an act of vandalism. Perriello's brother also received a threatening letter referencing the legislation.  Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] stated that posting a home address on a website and encouraging people to visit is "an appalling approach. It's not civil discourse, it's an invitation to intimidation and it's totally unacceptable."  Leaders of the Tea Party movement tried to contain the public relations damage by denouncing the violent acts and distancing themselves from those behind the acts. One Tea Party website issued a response saying the Tea Party member's action of posting the address "was not requested, sanctioned or endorsed by the Lynchburg Tea Party".  The director of the Northern Colorado Tea Party said, "Although many are frustrated by the passage of such controversial legislation, threats are absolutely not acceptable in any form, to any lawmaker, of any party."<ref>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/03/fbi_investigating_the_severing.html "FBI investigating cut gas line at Perriello's brother's home"], ''The Washington Post'', March 24, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/us/politics/26threat.html "Accusations Fly Between Parties Over Threats and Vandalism"], ''The New York Times'', March 25, 2010.</ref><ref>McNeill, Brian (March 24, 2010), [http://www2.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/crime/article/damage_at_home_of_perriello_brother_under_investigation/54038/ "Severed gas line found at home of Perriello brother"], ''[[The Daily Progress]]'' (Charlottesville, VA)</ref><ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/35040.html#ixzz0lC0cMKi7 "Tom Perriello gas line 'intentionally cut{{'"}}] ''Politico'', March 25, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34843.html Tea partiers told to 'drop by' Tom Perriello's home]; ''Politico''; March 22, 2010</ref>

In early July 2010, the North Iowa Tea Party (NITP) posted a billboard showing a photo of [[Adolf Hitler]] with the heading "National Socialism", one of Barack Obama with the heading "Democrat Socialism", and one of [[Vladimir Lenin]] with the heading "Marxist Socialism", all three marked with the word "change" and the statement "Radical leaders prey on the fearful and naive". It received sharp criticism, including some from other Tea Party activists. NITP co-founder Bob Johnson acknowledged the anti-socialist message may have gotten lost amid the fascist and communist images. Following a request from the NITP, the billboard was removed on July 14.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Iowa billboard linking Obama, Hitler removed |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38244427/ns/politics-decision_2010/t/iowa-billboard-linking-obama-hitler-removed/ |date=July 14, 2010 |publisher=MSNBC |agency=Associated Press |mode=cs2 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/13/obama-hitler-tea-party-billboard_n_645203.html "Iowa Tea Party Billboard Compares Obama To Hitler, Lenin"], ''The Huffington Post'', July 13, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/29518 "Tea Party billboard compares Obama to Hitler"], Capitol Hill Blue, July 14, 2010<!-- |author=Luke Meredith |agency=Associated Press--></ref>
