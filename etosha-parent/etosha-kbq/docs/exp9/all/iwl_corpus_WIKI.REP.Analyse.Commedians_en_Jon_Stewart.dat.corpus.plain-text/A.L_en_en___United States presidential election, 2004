The '''United States presidential election of 2004''' was the 55th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 2, 2004. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate and incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[John Kerry]], [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]].

Bush and incumbent Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] were renominated by their party with little difficulty. [[Howard Dean]] was initially the frontrunner for the Democratic Party's nomination, but Kerry won nearly all of the primaries and caucuses. Kerry chose Senator [[John Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], who had himself sought that party's 2004 presidential nomination, to be his running mate.

[[Foreign policy]] was the dominant theme throughout the election campaign, particularly Bush's conduct of the [[War on Terrorism]] and the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Domestic issues were debated as well, including [[Early 2000s recession|the economy]] and jobs, [[Healthcare in the United States|health care]], and [[Hot-button issue|moral values]].

Bush's margin of victory in the popular vote was the smallest ever for a reelected incumbent president. The electoral map closely resembled that of 2000, with only three states changing sides: [[New Mexico]] and [[Iowa]] voted Republican in 2004 after having voted Democratic in 2000, while [[New Hampshire]] voted Democratic in 2004 after previously voting Republican. In the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], Bush received 286 votes to Kerry's 251.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/front.htm "Campaign 2004 Election Results"]. ''USA Today''. Retrieved January 16, 2013.</ref>

==Background==
[[George W. Bush]] won the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] after the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' remanded the case to the [[Florida Supreme Court]], which declared there was not sufficient time to hold a recount without violating the [[U.S. Constitution]].

Just eight months into his presidency, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] of September 11, 2001 suddenly transformed Bush into a wartime president. Bush's approval ratings surged to near 90%. Within a month, the forces of a coalition led by the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|entered Afghanistan]], which had been sheltering [[Osama bin Laden]], suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks. By December, the [[Taliban]] had been removed as rulers of [[Kabul]], although a long and ongoing reconstruction would follow, severely hampered by ongoing turmoil and violence within the country.

The Bush administration then turned its attention to [[Iraq]], and argued the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]]. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/05/international/europe/05CND-PARI.html|work=The New York Times|first =John|last=Tagliabue|title=France, Germany and Russia Vow to Stop Use of Force Against Iraq|date=March 5, 2003}}</ref> Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=U.S advises weapons inspectors to leave Iraq|date=March 17, 2003}}</ref> The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a "[[coalition of the willing]]" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its [[military of Iraq|armed forces]], however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any [[weapon of mass destruction]] in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no "smoking guns". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']], in a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave [[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|a speech]] announcing the end of "major combat operations" in the [[Iraq War]]. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a [[CNN]]-[[USA Today]]-[[Gallup poll|Gallup]] [[opinion poll|poll]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml|title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising, Says Collecting Campaign Cash Now Will Keep War On Terror Focused|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref> However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted "democratization" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.

====Before the primaries====
By summer of 2003, Howard Dean had become the apparent front runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack with the largest campaign war chest. Dean's strength as a fund raiser was attributed mainly to his embrace of the Internet for campaigning. The majority of his donations came from individual supporters, who became known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniacs]]''. Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them. Senator Lieberman, a liberal on domestic issues but a hawk on the War on Terror, failed to gain traction with liberal Democratic primary voters.

In September 2003, retired four-star general [[Wesley Clark]] announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination. His campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, the Democrats did not flock to support his campaign.

In sheer numbers, Kerry had fewer endorsements than [[Howard Dean]], who was far ahead in the [[superdelegate]] race going into the Iowa caucuses in January 2004, although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager [[Jim Jordan (United States politics)|Jim Jordan]]. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] assigned [[Mary Beth Cahill]] to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's [[Mortgage loan|mortgaging]] his own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the "magical" [[Michael Whouley]] who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for [[Al Gore]] in 2000 against [[Bill Bradley]].

====Iowa caucus====
By the January 2004 [[Iowa caucus]]es, the field had dwindled down to nine candidates, as Bob Graham dropped out of the race and Howard Dean was a strong front-runner. However, the [[Iowa]] caucuses yielded unexpectedly strong results for [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidates [[John Kerry]], who earned 38% of the state's delegates and [[John Edwards]], who took 32%. Former front-runner [[Howard Dean]] slipped to 18% and third place, and [[Richard Gephardt]] finished fourth (11%). In the days leading up to the Iowa vote, there was much negative campaigning between the Dean and Gephardt camps.

The dismal results caused Gephardt to drop out and later endorse Kerry. Carol Moseley Braun also dropped out, endorsing Howard Dean. What further hurt Dean was a speech he gave at a post-caucus rally. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his [[Microphone#Unidirectional|unidirectional microphone]], leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.
The incessant replaying of the "[[Dean Scream]]" by the press became a debate on the topic of whether Dean was the victim of [[media bias]]. The scream scene was shown approximately 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days following the incident, a number that does not include talk shows and local news broadcasts.<ref>Loyola Phoenix, [http://www.loyolaphoenix.com/news/2004/02/11/Discourse/The-Scream.That.Left.Us.Blind-603629.shtml ''"The scream that left us blind"'']{{dead link|date=February 2014}}, 2/11/04. Retrieved November 27, 2006.</ref> However, those who were in the actual audience that day insist that they were not aware of the infamous "scream" until they returned to their hotel rooms and saw it on TV.<ref name="CBS040126">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Salzman |publisher=[[CBS News]] |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/26/politics/main596021.shtml |title=Dean's Scream: Not What It Seemed |date=January 26, 2004 |accessdate=November 27, 2006}}</ref>

Kerry had revived his campaign and began using the slogan "Comeback Kerry."

====New Hampshire primary====
On January 27, Kerry triumphed again, winning the [[New Hampshire primary]].  Dean finished second, Clark was third, and Edwards placed fourth. The largest of the debates was held at [[Saint Anselm College]] where both Kerry and Dean had strong performances.

====South Carolina primary====
[[File:Kerry02.jpg|thumb|Senator Kerry at a primary rally in St. Louis, Missouri, at the St. Louis Community College – Forest Park]]
The following week, John Edwards won the South Carolina primary and finished a strong second in [[Oklahoma]] to Clark. Lieberman dropped out of the campaign the following day. Kerry dominated throughout February and his support quickly snowballed as he won caucuses and primaries, taking in a string of wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], Hawaii, and [[Idaho]]. Clark and Dean dropped out during this time, leaving Edwards as the only real threat to Kerry. Kucinich and Sharpton continued to run despite poor results at the polls.

====Super Tuesday====
In March's [[Super Tuesday]], Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], New York, [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia, but, failing to win a single state other than South Carolina, chose to withdraw from the presidential race. Sharpton followed suit a couple weeks later. Kuninch did not leave the race officially until July.

====Democratic National Convention====
On July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate, shortly before the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], held later that month. Days before Kerry announced Edwards as his running mate, Kerry gave a short list of three candidates: Sen [[John Edwards]], Rep [[Dick Gephardt]], and Gov [[Tom Vilsack]]. Heading into the convention, the Kerry/Edwards ticket unveiled their new slogan—a promise to make America "stronger at home and more respected in the world." Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience the prominent theme of the convention. In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with, "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty." He later delivered what may have been the speech's most memorable line when he said, "the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to freedom," a quote that later appeared in a Kerry/Edwards television advertisement.

The keynote address at the convention was delivered by [[Illinois]] State Senator (and future President) [[Barack Obama]]; the speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernstein, David|date=June 2007|title=The Speech|magazine=Chicago Magazine|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2007/The-Speech|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref>

Bush's popularity rose as a wartime president, and he was able to ward off any serious challenge to the Republican nomination. Senator [[Lincoln Chafee]] of Rhode Island considered challenging Bush on an anti-war platform in [[New Hampshire]], but decided not to run after the capture of [[Saddam Hussein]] in December 2003.<ref>Lincoln Chafee, ''Against the Tide'' (2007), p.119-120</ref>

On March 10, 2004, Bush officially clinched the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] in New York City. Bush accepted the nomination on September 2, 2004, and selected [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] as his [[running mate]]. (In New York, the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Conservative Party of New York State]].) During the convention and throughout the campaign, Bush focused on two themes: defending America against terrorism and building an [[ownership society]]. The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the stock market, increasing home and stock ownership, and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance.

There were four other presidential tickets on the ballot in a number of states totaling enough electoral votes to have a theoretical possibility of winning a majority in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. They were:

*[[Ralph Nader]]/[[Peter Camejo]], [[independent (politican)|independent]] (also [[Reform Party USA|Reform Party]], [[Independent Party of Delaware]], [[Populist Party of Maryland|Populist Party]], [[Better Life Party]], Cross-endorsements N.Y., Peace and Justice Party, [[Independence Party of New York]], Independence Party S.C.).

==General election campaign==

===Campaign issues===
Bush focused his campaign on national security, presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted Kerry as a "[[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopper]]." This strategy was designed to convey  to American voters the idea that Bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while Kerry would be "uncertain in the face of danger." Bush (just as his father did with Dukakis in the 1988 election) also sought to portray Kerry as a "[[Massachusetts liberal]]" who was out of touch with mainstream Americans. One of Kerry's slogans was "Stronger at home, respected in the world." This advanced the suggestion that Kerry would pay more attention to domestic concerns; it also encapsulated Kerry's contention that Bush had alienated American allies by his foreign policy.

According to one exit poll, people who voted for Bush cited the issues of terrorism and moral values as the most important factors in their decision.<ref name="Exitpoll">{{cite web| title = Decision 2004 – Exit poll | publisher = [[MSNBC]]| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5297138/ | accessdate =June 5, 2008 }}</ref>  Kerry supporters cited the war in Iraq, the economy and jobs, and health care.<ref name="Exitpoll"/>

[[File:Bush cropped.jpg|thumb|Bush speaking at campaign rally in St. Petersburg, Florida, October 19, 2004]]
Over the course of Bush's first term in office, his extremely high approval ratings immediately following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] steadily dwindled, peaking only during combat operations in Iraq in the spring of 2003, and again following the capture of [[Saddam Hussein]] in December the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm |title=Historical Bush Approval Ratings |publisher=Hist.umn.edu |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>  Kerry supporters attempted to capitalize on the dwindling popularity to rally anti-war sentiment.

In March 2004, the Bush/Cheney campaign was criticized by 2004 Racism Watch.  The organization took offense to a campaign ad, which showed a man who was possibly Middle Eastern in a negative light.  2004 Racism Watch issued a press release calling on the campaign to pull the ad, calling it disturbing and offensive.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2004/0331-04.htm| publisher=Common Dreams | title=2004 Racism Watch Calls On Bush-Cheney Campaign to Change or Pull Offensive Ad | accessdate=October 4, 2008}}</ref>

During August and September 2004, there was an intense focus on events that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bush was accused of [[George W. Bush military service controversy|failing to fulfill his required service]] in the [[Texas Air National Guard]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush fell short on duty at Guard | date=September 8, 2004 | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/09/08/bush_fell_short_on_duty_at_guard/ | publisher=Boston Globe |accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref>  However, the focus quickly shifted to the conduct of [[CBS News]] after they aired a segment on ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' introducing what became known as the [[Killian documents]].<ref>{{cite news | title=CBS ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' transcript |date=September 8, 2004 | url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/1B.pdf | accessdate=June 16, 2007 | publisher=Thornburgh-Boccardi Report, Exhibit 1B |format=PDF}}</ref> Serious doubts about the [[Killian documents authenticity issues|documents' authenticity]] quickly emerged,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9967-2004Sep9.html |title=Some Question Authenticity of Papers on Bush|author=Michael Dobbs and Mike Allen|work=Washington Post|date=September 9, 2004 |accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref> leading CBS to appoint a review panel that eventually resulted in the firing of the news producer and other significant staffing changes.<ref>{{cite news | title= Thornburgh-Boccardi report | url=http://wwwimage.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/complete_report/CBS_Report.pdf | accessdate=June 16, 2007 | publisher=CBS News |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title= Final Figure in '60 Minutes' Scandal Resigns|date=March 25, 2005|agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151180,00.html | accessdate=June 16, 2007 | work=Fox News}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Kerry was accused by the [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth]], who averred that "phony [[war crimes]] charges, his exaggerated claims about his own service in Vietnam, and his deliberate misrepresentation of the nature and effectiveness of Swift boat operations compels us to step forward." The group challenged the legitimacy of each of the combat medals awarded to Kerry by the [[U.S. Navy]], and the disposition of his discharge.

In the beginning of September, the successful Republican National Convention along with the allegations by Kerry's former mates gave Bush his first comfortable margin since Kerry had won the nomination. A post-convention Gallup poll showed the President leading the Senator by 14 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/chart3way.html |title=RealClear Politics – Polls |publisher=Realclearpolitics.com |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/bush_vs_kerry.html |title=RealClear Politics – Polls |publisher=Realclearpolitics.com |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>

===Debates===
[[File:Bush Kerry 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Neighboring yard signs for Bush and Kerry in Grosse Pointe, Michigan]]
{{Main|United States presidential election debates, 2004}}
Three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate were organized by the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]], and held in the autumn of 2004. As expected, these debates set the agenda for the final leg of the political contest. Libertarian Party candidate Michael Badnarik and Green Party candidate David Cobb were arrested while trying to access the debates. Badnarik was attempting to serve papers to the Commission on Presidential Debates.

The first debate was held on September 30 at the [[University of Miami]], moderated by [[Jim Lehrer]] of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. During the debate, slated to focus on foreign policy, Kerry accused Bush of having failed to gain international support for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, saying the only countries assisting the U.S. during the invasion were the United Kingdom and Australia. Bush replied to this by saying, "[[You forgot Poland|Well, actually, he forgot Poland]]." Later, a consensus formed among mainstream pollsters and pundits that Kerry won the debate decisively, strengthening what had come to be seen as a weak and troubled campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/ |title=Poll: Kerry Wins Debate, Pulls Even|publisher=msnbc.com |date=October 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080512033726/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 12, 2008}}</ref> In the days after, coverage focused on Bush's apparent annoyance with Kerry and numerous scowls and negative facial expressions.

On October 5, the Vice Presidential debate between [[Dick Cheney]] and [[John Edwards]] was held at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and was moderated by [[Gwen Ifill]] of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. An initial poll by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] indicated a victory for Cheney, while polls by [[CNN]] and [[MSNBC]] gave it to Edwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s5000.com/what_the_huck/589/cheney_edwards.php |title=s5000.com |publisher=s5000.com |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3716852.stm |title=US running mates clash over Iraq |publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 3, 2008 | date=October 6, 2004}}</ref><ref>[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/05/DEBATE.TMP San Francisco Chronicle]{{dead link|date=February 2014}} October 5, 2004</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/Vote2004/vp_debate_poll_041006.html|first=Gary|last=Langer|first2=Dalia|last2=Sussman|title=Cheney Gains With Help From His Friends|publisher=ABC News|date=October 6, 2004|accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>

The second presidential debate was held at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on October 8, moderated by [[Charles Gibson]] of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  Conducted in a town meeting format, less formal than the first Presidential debate, this debate saw Bush and Kerry taking questions on a variety of subjects from a local audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3729206.stm |title=US debate: What the commentators said |publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 3, 2008 | date=October 9, 2004}}</ref>  Bush attempted to deflect criticism of what was described as his scowling demeanor during the first debate, joking at one point about one of Kerry's remarks, "That answer made me want to scowl."<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush, Kerry make draft, tax pledges|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-deb09.html|date=October 9, 2004|first=Scott|last=Fornek|work=Chicago Sun-Times|archivedate=October 11, 2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041011103033/http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-deb09.html}}</ref>

Bush and Kerry met for the third and final debate at [[Arizona State University]] on October 13.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,135380,00.html |title=Transcript & Video: Third Debate – You Decide 2004 |publisher=Fox News |date=October 14, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>  51 million viewers watched the debate which was moderated by [[Bob Schieffer]] of [[CBS News]]. However, at the time of the ASU debate, there were 15.2 million viewers tuned in to watch the [[Major League Baseball]] playoffs broadcast simultaneously. After Kerry, responding to a question about gay rights, reminded the audience that [[Mary Cheney|Vice President Cheney's daughter]] was a lesbian, Cheney responded with a statement calling himself "a pretty angry father".<ref>Vanden Brook, Tom (October 14, 2004).

===Osama bin Laden videotape===
{{main|2004 Osama bin Laden video}}
On October 29, four days before the election, excerpts of a video of [[Osama bin Laden]] addressing the American people were broadcast on [[al Jazeera]]. In his remarks, bin Laden mentions the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and taunted Bush over his response to them. In the days following the video's release, Bush's lead over Kerry increased by several points.<ref>{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Sherwell |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1475515/Bush-takes-a-six-point-lead-after-new-bin-Laden-tape.html |title=Bush takes a six-point lead after new bin Laden tape |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London |date=October 31, 2004 |accessdate=October 5, 2012| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081206183353/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1475515/Bush-takes-a-six-point-lead-after-new-bin-Laden-tape.html| archivedate= December 6, 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Notable expressions and phrases===
*[[Flip-flop (politics)|Flip-flop]]: although the term existed prior to the elections, Republicans used it to describe John Kerry after he said "I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it."
*[[Joementum]]: used in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|primaries]] by [[Joe Lieberman]] to say that he has momentum. It has since been used to ridicule Joe Lieberman, since his campaign did not pick up momentum and he dropped out of the race.
*[[Swiftboating]]: a term used during the campaign to describe the work of the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]]. The term has been used since the campaign to describe a harsh attack by a political opponent that is dishonest, personal and unfair.
*[[You forgot Poland]]: paraphrased from Bush's comment in the [[United States presidential election debates, 2004#September 30: First presidential debate (University of Miami)|first debate]] when he said "Well, actually, he forgot Poland". Used to emphasize that the [[Coalition of the willing|coalition]] was not as big as the list suggested because most of the countries in the coalition had a small number of troops.

Electoral balloting in Minnesota was performed by secret ballot, and none of the electors admitted to casting the Edwards vote for President, so it may never be known who the [[faithless elector]] was. It is not even known whether the vote for Edwards was deliberate or unintentional; the Republican Secretary of State and several of the Democratic electors have expressed the opinion that this was an accident.<ref>Minnesota Public Radio: [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/12/13_ap_electors/ Minnesota elector gives Edwards a vote; Kerry gets other nine]</ref>

===Electoral vote error in New York===
New York's initial electoral vote certificate indicated that all of its 31 electoral votes for president were cast for "John '''L.''' Kerry of Massachusetts" instead of John '''F.''' Kerry, who won the popular vote in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2004_certificates/vote_new_york_03.html |title=NARA Federal Register U. S. Electoral College 2004 Certificate |publisher=Archives.gov|accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>  This was apparently the result of a typographical error, and an amended electoral vote certificate with the correct middle initial was transmitted to the [[Vice President of the United States|President of the Senate]] prior to the official electoral vote count.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2004_certificates/vote_new_york_03_amended.html |title=NARA Federal Register U.

===Analysis===
[[File:2004US election map.svg|Map comparing voter turnout to result|thumb|350px]]
* Compared to [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] vs. [[Al Gore]], Bush picked up a net gain of 8 [[electoral votes]] due to narrow victories in [[United States presidential election in Iowa, 2004|Iowa]] and [[United States presidential election in New Mexico, 2004|New Mexico]] while conceding a close loss in [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 2004|New Hampshire]], and a net gain of 7 votes due to the [[United States congressional apportionment|reapportionment of electors]] in 2003 as a result of the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 census]], for a total net gain of 15 electoral votes.
* This was the first election since [[George H.W. Bush]] won the United States presidential election, 1988 election in which the winning presidential candidate of either party won an absolute majority (over 50%) of the popular vote.
* Bush won the popular vote with 50.73% to Kerry's 48.27%. Although in percentage terms it was the closest popular margin ever for a victorious sitting president, Bush received 2.5% more than Kerry. Bush's absolute victory margin (approximately 3 million votes) was the smallest of any sitting president since [[Harry S. Truman]] in [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]].
* At least 12 million more votes were cast than in the 2000 election. Voter turnout was unusually high. American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate reported a record turnout of 60.7% of eligible voting-age citizens, 6.4% higher than turnout in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|previous election]] and the highest since [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/ia/cdem/csae/pdfs/csae050114.pdf|format=PDF|title="Turnout Exceeds Optimistic Predictions: More Than 122 Million Vote," Press Release, Center for the Study of the American Electorate, issued January 14, 2005|publisher=Center for the Study of the American Electorate |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> Note, however, that the "eligible" voting-age electorate is by definition smaller than the total voting-age population.  In a formal report, the Federal Election Commission released a lower figure of 56.70% for the percentage of the electorate that voted for a presidential candidate,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/tables.pdf |format=PDF|title="2004 Election Results," FEC formal publication |publisher=fec.gov |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}</ref> based on the latter, larger pool (as calculated by the Census Bureau).
* Owing to the nation's growing population and large turnout, both Bush and Kerry received more votes than any previous presidential candidate in American history. The previous record was held by Republican [[Ronald Reagan]], who in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] received 54.4 million votes.
* Five states saw every county vote for one candidate: Bush won every county in Utah and Oklahoma while Kerry won every county in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.
* As in 2000, electoral votes split along sharp geographical lines: the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and most of the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] for Kerry, and the [[Southern United States|South]], [[Great Plains]], and [[Mountain States]] for Bush. The widespread support for Bush in the Southern states continued the transformation of the formerly Democratic [[Solid South]] to the Republican South.
* This is the first time a candidate from either party won the Presidency without carrying a single Northeastern state.
* Minor party candidates received many fewer votes, dropping from a total of 3.5% in 2000 to approximately one percent. As in 2000, [[Ralph Nader]] finished in third place, but his total declined from 2.9 million to 400,000 votes, leaving him with fewer votes than [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]] had received in finishing fourth in 2000.
* The 2004 election completed the transition of Illinois from a swing state into a reliably Democratic one. Up through the 2000 election both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates campaigned in the state during elections.  It went for Ronald Reagan and George Bush from 1980–1988, and Bill Clinton and Al Gore from 1992 to 2000. Both George Bush and Al Gore spent large amounts of time and resources in the state; in 2004 it was not the case.
* The election marked the first time an incumbent president was returned to office while his political party increased its numbers in both houses of Congress since [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]]. It was the first time for a Republican since [[William McKinley]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900 election]]. This would not last for long however, as the Republicans lost control of both chambers of Congress in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]].
* Although the election was close, nearly half of U.S. voters lived in a county where Bush or Kerry won by 20 percentage points or more. By comparison, only a quarter lived in such counties in 1976.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bishop |first=Bill |author2=Cushing, Robert  |title=The Big Sort: Migration, Economy and Politics in the United States of 'Those People' |url=http://www.aei.org/docLib/20080229_BillBishop.pdf |date=February 29, 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>
* Bush became the first President to be elected to two terms without carrying any of these states in either of his campaigns: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. He was also the first Republican to be elected without ever carrying Vermont in either of his campaigns.

===Electoral College changes from 2000===
With the completion of the 2000 census, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] [[United States Congressional Apportionment|reapportionment]] took place, moving some representative districts from the slowest growing states to the fastest growing. As a result, several states had a different number of electors in the [[U.S. Electoral College]] in 2004 than in 2000, since the number of electors allotted to each state is equal to the sum of the number of [[United States Senate|Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] from that state.

The following table shows the change in electors from the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]].  Red states represent those won by [[George W. Bush|Bush]]; and blue states, those won by both [[Al Gore|Gore]] and [[John Kerry|Kerry]]. All states except Nebraska and Maine use a [[First-past-the-post election system|winner-take-all]] allocation of electors. Each of these states was won by the same party in 2004 that had won it in 2000; thus, George W. Bush received a net gain of seven electoral votes due to reapportionment while the Democrats lost the same amount.

==Battleground states==
[[File:CheneyatWJ2004.jpg|thumb|Cheney visited [[Washington & Jefferson College]] in [[Pennsylvania]] on October 27, 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/bush/cheneycal1004a.html |title=Travels of Vice President Dick Cheney-October 2004 |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>]]
During the campaign and as the results came in on the night of the election there was much focus on [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Florida]]. These three [[Swing state|swing]] states were seen as evenly divided, and with each casting 20 electoral votes or more, they had the power to decide the election. As the final results came in, Kerry took Pennsylvania and then Bush took Florida, focusing all attention on Ohio.

The morning after the election, the major candidates were neck and neck. It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared ([[New Mexico]] and [[Iowa]]), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to [[provisional ballot]]s that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, [[Nevada]] and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269–269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral tie]] would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon Ohio's Secretary of State, [[Ken Blackwell]], announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat. Had Kerry won Ohio, he would have won the election despite losing the national popular vote by over 3 million votes, a complete reversal of the 2000 election when Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by over 500,000 votes.

The upper Midwest bloc of [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], and [[Wisconsin]] is also notable, casting a sum of 27 electoral votes. The following is list of the states considered swing states in the 2004 election by most news organizations and which candidate they eventually went for. The two major parties chose to focus their advertising on these states:

==Election controversy==
{{Main|2004 United States election voting controversies}}
[[File:2004ElectionControversyMap.jpg|300px|thumb|Map of election day problems]]
After the election, some sources reported indications of possible data irregularities and systematic flaws during the voting process, which are covered in detail by the election controversy articles.

Although the overall result of the election was not challenged by the Kerry campaign, Green Party presidential candidate [[David Cobb]] and Libertarian Party presidential candidate [[Michael Badnarik]] obtained a recount in [[Ohio]]. This recount was completed December 28, 2004, although on January 24, 2007, a jury convicted two Ohio elections officials of selecting precincts to recount where they already knew the hand total would match the machine total, thereby avoiding having to perform a full recount.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012401441.html | title = Election Staff Convicted in Recount Rig | work = Washington Post | date = January 24, 2007 | first=M.R. | last=Kropko | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>

At the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6, a motion was made contesting Ohio's electoral votes. Because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, election law mandated that each house retire to debate and vote on the motion. In the House of Representatives, the motion was supported by 31 Democrats. It was opposed by 178 Republicans, 88 Democrats and one independent. Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 7 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=January 6, 2005 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>  Four people elected to the House had not yet taken office, and one seat was vacant. In the Senate, it was supported only by its maker, [[Barbara Boxer|Senator Boxer]], with 74 Senators opposed and 25 not voting. During the debate, no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote. Senator Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome, but to "shed the light of truth on these irregularities."

Kerry would later state that "the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters." In the same article, [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Howard Dean]] said "I'm not confident that the election in Ohio was fairly decided... We know that there was substantial voter suppression, and the machines were not reliable. It should not be a surprise that the Republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections. That's what we suspect has happened."<ref name=RS>{{cite news|url= http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0601-34.htm |title=Was the 2004 Election Stolen? : Rolling Stone |publisher=Rollingstone.com |author=Kennedy, Robert F.|accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>

==New during this campaign==

===International observers===
At the invitation of the United States government, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]) sent a team of observers to monitor the presidential elections in 2004. It was the first time the OSCE had sent observers to a U.S. presidential election, although they had been invited in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/interactive/wilkinson_osce.html |title=Interactive White House Home Page |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref> In September 2004 the OSCE issued a report on U.S. electoral processes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2004/09/3655_en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - US NAM Report, 28 Sep 2004.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aicgs.org/c/renvertc.shtml]{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}</ref> and the election final report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/03/13658_en.pdf |title=XI |format=PDF |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref> The report reads: "The November 2, 2004 elections in the United States mostly met the OSCE commitments included in the 1990 Copenhagen Document. They were conducted in an environment that reflects a long-standing democratic tradition, including institutions governed by the rule of law, free and generally professional media, and a civil society intensively engaged in the election process. There was exceptional public interest in the two leading presidential candidates and the issues raised by their respective campaigns, as well as in the election process itself."

Earlier, some 13 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] from the [[US Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] had sent a letter to [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] asking for the UN to monitor the elections. The UN responded that such a request could only come from the official national executive. The move was met by considerable opposition from Republican lawmakers.<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040806-115723-1192r.htm Washington Times] August 6, 2004</ref> The OSCE is not affiliated with the United Nations.

===Electronic voting===
{{further2|[[Electronic voting#Analysis of electronic voting|Analysis of electronic voting]]}}
For 2004, some states expedited the implementation of [[electronic voting]] systems for the election, raising several issues:
* '''Software.''' Without proper testing and certification, critics believe [[electronic voting]] machines could produce an incorrect report due to malfunction or deliberate manipulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/the_problem_wit.html |title=Bruce Schneier: The Problem with Electronic Voting Machines, November 2004 |publisher=Schneier.com |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>
* '''Recounts.''' A recount of an electronic voting machine is not a recount in the traditional sense. The machine can be audited for irregularities and voting totals stored on multiple backup devices can be compared, but vote counts will not change.
* '''Partisan ties.''' Democrats noted the Republican or conservative ties of several leading executives in the companies providing the machines.<ref name="Warner">Warner, Melanie.

===Campaign law changes===
The 2004 election was the first to be affected by the [[campaign finance reform]]s mandated by the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002]] (also known as the [[John McCain|McCain]]-[[Russ Feingold|Feingold]] Bill for its sponsors in the [[United States Senate]]). Because of the Act's restrictions on candidates' and parties' fundraising, a large number of so-called [[527 group]]s emerged. Named for a section of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes as long as they do not coordinate their activities with political campaigns. Examples of 527s include [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]], [[MoveOn.org]], the [[Media Fund]], and [[America Coming Together]]. Many such groups were active throughout the campaign season. (There was some similar activity, although on a much lesser scale, during the 2000 campaign.)

To distinguish official campaigning from independent campaigning, political advertisements on television were required to include a verbal disclaimer identifying the organization responsible for the advertisement. Advertisements produced by political campaigns usually included the statement, "I'm ''[candidate's name]'', and I approve this message." Advertisements produced by independent organizations usually included the statement, "[Organization name] is responsible for the content of this advertisement," and from September 3 (60 days before the general election), such organizations' ads were prohibited from mentioning any candidate by name. Previously, television advertisements only required a written "paid for by" disclaimer on the screen.

This law was not well known or widely publicized at the beginning of the Democratic primary season, which led to some early misperception of Howard Dean, who was the first candidate to buy television advertising in this election cycle. Not realizing that the law required the phrasing, some people viewing the ads reportedly questioned why Dean might say such a thing—such questions were easier to ask because of the maverick nature of Dean's campaign in general.

===Colorado's Amendment 36===
{{Main|Colorado Amendment 36}}
A ballot initiative in [[Colorado]], known as [[Colorado Amendment 36|Amendment 36]], would have changed the way in which the state apportions its electoral votes. Rather than assigning all 9 of the state's electors to the candidate with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of popular votes, under the amendment Colorado would have assigned presidential electors proportionally to the statewide vote count, which would be a unique system ([[Nebraska]] and [[Maine]] assign electoral votes based on vote totals within each congressional district). Detractors claimed that this splitting would diminish Colorado's influence in the Electoral College, and the amendment ultimately failed, receiving only 34% of the vote.

Although the Colorado initiative failed, similar concerns in other states eventually led to the emergence of [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], which was signed by the first state in April 2007 and was adopted by 9 states, adding up to 132 electoral votes, by August 2011.
