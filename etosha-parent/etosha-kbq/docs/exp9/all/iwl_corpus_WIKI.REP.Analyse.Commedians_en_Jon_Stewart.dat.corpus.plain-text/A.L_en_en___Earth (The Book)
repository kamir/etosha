'''''Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race''''' is a 2010 [[humor]] book written by [[Jon Stewart]] and other writers of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', a sequel to ''[[America (The Book)]]''.  It was released on September 21, 2010.

==Synopsis==
Written in the past tense, the book's stated purpose is to serve as a [[Baedeker]] travel guide for an alien civilization that discovers Earth after humanity has died out, most likely by its own hands. As such, ''Earth (The Book)'' attempts to chronicle the history of the planet and the human race from the beginning to the present day, and also tries to explain human concepts and emotions such as "love" and "work" for its alien readers.<ref name="ew1" />

The book follows a similar format to ''America (The Book)'', being written in the style of a textbook and featuring many images, including visual gags. One controversial visual gag in ''America'' was a [[photoshop]]ped image of the United States Supreme Court justices nude; a similar gag appeared in ''Earth'' which was an illustration of human anatomy that featured a nude man, one half of the man depicting [[Larry King]].
