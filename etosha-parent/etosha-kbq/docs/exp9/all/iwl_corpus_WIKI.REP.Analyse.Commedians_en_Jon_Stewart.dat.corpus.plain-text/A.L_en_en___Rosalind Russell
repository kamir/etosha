'''Rosalind Russell''' (June 4, 1907 – November 28, 1976) was an American actress of [[theatre|stage]] and [[film|screen]],<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', December 1, 1976, page 79.</ref> known for her role as fast-talking newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson in the [[Howard Hawks]] screwball comedy ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), as well as for her portrayals of Mame Dennis in ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]'' (1958) and [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose]] in ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962). A noted comedienne,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rosalind Russell:  Biography|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/167490%7C135102/Rosalind-Russell/biography.html|website=tcm.com|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=12 March 2015}}</ref> she won all five [[Golden Globes]] for which she was nominated and was tied with [[Meryl Streep]] for most wins until Streep won her sixth award in 2007. Russell won a [[Tony Award]] in 1953 for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Ruth in the Broadway show ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' (a musical based on the film ''[[My Sister Eileen (1942 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'', in which she also starred). She has been nominated for four [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in a leading role throughout her career.

In addition to her fame as a comedienne, Russell was known for playing character roles, exceptionally wealthy, dignified, ladylike women, as well as for being one of the few actresses of her time who regularly played professional women, such as judges, reporters, and psychiatrists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Basinger|first=Jeanine|title=A Woman's View: How Hollywood Spoke to Women, 1930–1960|year=1993|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Hanover|isbn=0-8195-6291-2|pages=178|edition=Reprinted.}}</ref> She had a wide career span from the 1930s to the 1970s, and attributed her long career to the fact that, although usually playing classy and glamorous roles, she never became a [[sex symbol]].<ref>"Rosalind Russell Dies, Fought 15-Year Battle", ''[[Reading Eagle]]'', November 29, 1976, p. 34</ref>

==Early years==
Rosalind Russell was one of seven children born in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], to James Edward and Clara A. (née McKnight) Russell,<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/russell.htm Rosalind Russell genealogy site]; accessed April 9, 2014.</ref> an [[Irish-American]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] family.<ref name="cozad">{{cite book|last=Cozad|first=W. Lee|title=More Magnificent Mountain Movies: The Silverscreen Years, 1940–2004|isbn=0-9723372-2-9|page=145}}</ref> She was named after a ship on which her parents had traveled,<ref name="cozad"/> ''not'' for the character from ''[[As You Like It]]''. She attended Catholic schools, including [[Rosemont College]] in [[Rosemont, Pennsylvania]] and [[Marymount College, Tarrytown|Marymount College]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], before attending the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in [[New York City]]. Her parents thought Russell was studying to become a teacher, and were unaware that she was planning to become a stage comedienne.<ref name="showgirl">"Show Girls Get Training In Colleges", ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', December 3, 1930, p. 24</ref>

==Career==
[[File:YoungRozRussell.jpg|left|thumb|Russell (c. 1930)]]
Russell started her career as a fashion model and was in many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows. Against parental objections, she took a job at a stock company for seven months at [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]] and then [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref name="showgirl"/> Afterwards, she moved to [[Boston]], where she acted for a year at a theater group for [[Edward E. Clive]]. Later, she appeared in a revue in New York (The Garrick Gaieties). There, she took voice lessons and built a career in the opera, which was short-lived due to her inability to reach high notes.<ref name="showgirl"/>

In the early 1930s, Russell went west to Los Angeles to be a contract actress for Universal Pictures. When she first arrived on the lot, she was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press she felt terrible and humiliated at the studio, which affected her self-confidence.<ref name="stand">"Take the Stand, Rosalind Russell" by Ed Sullivan, ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', July 14, 1939, p. 27</ref> Unhappy with Universal's leadership, and second-class film status at the time, Russell set her sights on [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) and was able to get out of her Universal contract on her own terms. When MGM first approached her for a [[screen test]], Russell was not enthusiastic, remembering Universal. When she met MGM's [[Benny Thau]] and Ben Piazza, she was surprised, as they were "the soul of understanding".<ref name="stand" /> Her screen test was directed by [[Harold S. Bucquet]], and she later recalled that she was hired because of a closeup he took of her.<ref name="stand" />

[[File:RozRussell&NormaShearer.jpg|right|thumb|In ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) with [[Norma Shearer]] ]]

Picked up by MGM, Russell debuted in ''[[Evelyn Prentice]]'' (1934). Although the role was small, she was noticed, with one critic saying that she was "convincing as the woman scorned".<ref>"William Powell, Myrna Loy Score On Capitol Screen", ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 19, 1934, p. 12</ref> She starred in many comedies such as ''[[Forsaking All Others]]'' (1934), and ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938), as well as dramas, including ''[[Craig's Wife (film)|Craig's Wife]]'' (1936) (which would be the film's second of three remakes; [[Joan Crawford]] did the third) and ''[[The Citadel (film)|The Citadel]]'' (1938). Russell was first acclaimed when she co-starred with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the MGM drama ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935). One critic wrote: "Rosalind Russell as the 'other woman' in the story gives an intelligent and deft handling to her scenes with [[Robert Young (actor)|Young]]."<ref>"Amusements", ''The Daily Times: Rochester and Beaver'', August 11, 1935, p. 9</ref> She quickly rose to fame and, by 1935, was seen as a replacement for actress [[Myrna Loy]], as she took many roles Loy was initially set for.<ref>"For Your Amusement" by Miriam Bell, ''[[The Miami News]]'', October 30, 1935, p. 11</ref> {{cns|date=March 2015|text=Furthermore, one journalist claimed that she was the only newcomer of 1935 destined for stardom.}}

In her first years at Hollywood, Russell was, both in her personal life and film career, characterized as a sophisticated lady. This dissatisfied Russell, who claimed in a 1936 interview:

<blockquote>Being typed as a lady is the greatest misfortune possible to a motion picture actress. It limits your characterizations, confines you to play feminine sops and menaces and the public never highly approves of either. An impeccably dressed lady is always viewed with suspicion in real life and when you strut onto the screen with beautiful clothes and charming manners, the most naive of theatergoers senses immediately that you are in a position to do the hero no good. I earnestly want to get away from this. First, because I want to improve my career and professional life and, secondly because I am tired of being a clothes horse – a sort of hothouse orchid in a stand of wild flowers.<ref name="sock">"Rosalind Russell Yearns To Be Socked on Her Chin", ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', March 3, 1936, p. 16</ref></blockquote>

Russell approached director [[Frank Lloyd]] for help changing her image, but, instead of helping her, Lloyd cast her as a wealthy aristocrat in ''[[Under Two Flags (1936 film)|Under Two Flags]]'' (1936).<ref name="sock"/> In 1939, she was cast as catty gossip Sylvia Fowler in the all-female comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'', directed by [[George Cukor]]. The film was a major hit, boosting her career and establishing her reputation as a comedienne.

[[File:hgf3.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940)]]
Russell continued to display her talent for comedy in the classic [[screwball comedy]] ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), directed by [[Howard Hawks]]. In the film, a reworking of Ben Hecht's story ''The Front Page'', Russell played quick-witted ace reporter Hildy Johnson, who was also the ex-wife of her newspaper editor Walter Burns ([[Cary Grant]]). Russell had been, as she put it, "Everyone's fifteenth choice" for the role of Hildy in the film. Prior to her being cast, Howard Hawks had asked [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Irene Dunne]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] if they'd like to play the brash, fast-talking reporter in his film. All of them refused.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/206/His-Girl-Friday/articles.html His Girl Friday (1940) - Articles - TCM.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Russell found out about this while riding on a train to New York, when she read an article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' saying that she'd been cast in the film and listing all the actresses who had turned the part down.

In the 1940s, she made comedies such as ''[[The Feminine Touch (1941 film)|The Feminine Touch]]'' (1941) and ''[[Take a Letter, Darling]]'' (1942), dramas including  ''[[Sister Kenny]]'' (1946), and ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947), and a murder mystery: ''[[The Velvet Touch]]'' (1948).

Over the course of her career, Russell earned four [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]: ''[[My Sister Eileen (1942 film)|My Sister Eileen]]'' (1942); ''Sister Kenny'' (1946); ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1947); and the [[Auntie Mame (film)|movie version]] of ''[[Auntie Mame]]'' (1958). She received a Special [[Academy Award]], the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], in 1972, which came with an Oscar statuette.

Russell scored a big hit on Broadway with her [[Tony Award]]-winning performance in ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), a musical version of her successful film of a decade earlier, ''My Sister Eileen''. Russell reprised her starring role for a 1958 television special.

[[File:RozRussellAuntieMame.jpg|thumb|Rosalind Russell (left) and [[Polly Rowles]] in the original Broadway production of ''Auntie Mame'' (1957)]]

Perhaps her most memorable performance was in the title role of the long-running stage hit ''[[Auntie Mame]]'' and the subsequent [[Auntie Mame (film)|1958 movie version]], in which she played an eccentric aunt whose orphaned nephew comes to live with her. When asked which role she was most closely identified with, she replied that strangers who spotted her still called out, "Hey, Auntie Mame!" She received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actress in a Play in 1957 for her performance. [[Patrick Dennis]] dedicated his second Auntie Mame book ''[[Around the World with Auntie Mame]]'' to "the one and only Rosalind Russell" in 1958. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

She continued to appear in movies through the mid-1960s, including ''[[Picnic (1955 film)|Picnic]]'' (1955), ''[[A Majority of One]]'' (1961), ''[[Five Finger Exercise (film)|Five Finger Exercise]]'' (1962), ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962), and ''[[The Trouble with Angels (film)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' (1966). Russell was the logical choice for reprising her role as Auntie Mame when its Broadway musical adaptation ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' was set for production in 1966, but she declined for health reasons. In addition to her acting career, Russell also wrote the story (under the name C. A. McKnight) for the film ''[[The Unguarded Moment (film)|The Unguarded Moment]]'' (1956), a story of sexual harassment starring [[Esther Williams]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Personal life==
On October 25, 1941, Russell married [[Denmark|Danish]]-American producer [[Frederick Brisson]], son of actor [[Carl Brisson]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=1941-11-10|title=People|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|publisher=Time, Inc.|page=51|issn=0024-3019}}</ref> Cary Grant was responsible for the couple having met, and was the best man at Frederick and Rosalind's wedding. Brisson had been traveling from England to the United States by ship in 1939, and ''The Women'' was playing on an endless loop during the voyage. After hearing the audio for the film day after day while traveling, Brisson decided he had better sit down and watch the whole film. He became so enamored with Russell's performance as Sylvia Fowler that he turned to his friends and proclaimed: "I'm either gonna kill that girl, or I'm gonna marry her." (Or so he liked to say.)<ref>{{cite book|title=Life Is a Banquet|last=Russell|first=Rosalind|author2=Chase, Chris |year=1977|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-42134-6|oclc=3017310|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

Brisson stayed with [[Cary Grant]] in his guest house while Grant was filming ''His Girl Friday''. Upon hearing that Grant was making the movie with Russell, Brisson asked his friend if he could meet her.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life Is a Banquet|last=Russell|first=Rosalind|author2=Chase, Chris |year=1977|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-42134-6|oclc=3017310|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}</ref> Cary Grant then spent weeks greeting Russell each morning on set with the question, "Have you met Freddie Brisson?" in an effort to pique the actress's curiosity. One night, when Russell opened her door to let Grant in before they went dancing, as they often did, she found him standing next to a stranger. Grant sheepishly explained that the odd fellow was Freddie Brisson, the man whom he had mentioned so often, and they set off for dinner, with Freddie in tow. Russell and Brisson's marriage lasted 35 years, ending with her death. They had one child in 1943, a son, Carl Lance Brisson.<ref name="biodata"/><ref name=sarvady>{{cite book|last1=Sarvady|first1=Andrea|last2=Miller|first2=Frank|title=Leading Ladies: The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era|year=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=0-8118-5248-2|page=169}}</ref>

She was a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the [[Catholic Motion Picture Guild]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].<ref>[http://www.goodshepherdbh.org/a-city-on-a-hill/our-history/ Church of the Good Shepherd: Our History]</ref>

Russell was a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who campaigned for [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/1968-presidential-racerepublicans/</ref>

==Death==
Russell died of [[breast cancer]] on November 28, 1976.<ref name=sarvady /> She was survived by her husband and her son. She is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dick|first=Bernard F. |title=Forever Mame: The Life of Rosalind Russell|year=2006|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-890-8|page=256}}</ref>

Rosalind Russell has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], at 1708 Vine Street.

Her autobiography, written with [[Chris Chase]], ''Life Is a Banquet,'' was published a year after her death. In the foreword (written by her husband), he states that Russell had a [[mental breakdown]] some time in 1943. Details are scant (she made no films in 1944), but it indicates that her health problems paired with the deaths of a sister and a brother, can be traced back to the 1940s.<ref>{{cite book
