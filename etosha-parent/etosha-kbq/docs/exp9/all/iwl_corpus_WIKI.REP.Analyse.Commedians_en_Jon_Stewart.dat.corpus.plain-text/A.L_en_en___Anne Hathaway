Hathaway began appearing in dramatic roles after ''The Princess Diaries 2''. She said that "anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve", although she noted that "it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me".<ref name="jane"/> She voiced [[Little Red Riding Hood|Red Puckett]] in the [[computer-animated|animated]] comedy ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' (2005), based on the ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' [[Folklore|folktale]], which received mixed reviews by critics. Hathaway replaced Red's original voice artist [[Tara Strong]] and sang the song "Great Big World". That same year, Hathaway starred in [[Barbara Kopple]]'s drama film ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', in which she played a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. Although the content of the film was different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that doing nudity in certain movies is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein |first=Daniel Robert |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/girlfriends/features/annehathaway/ |title=Anne Hathaway of Brokeback Mountain |publisher=ugo.com |accessdate=October 10, 2008}}</ref>

After ''Havoc,'' Hathaway was cast alongside [[Heath Ledger]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] in [[Ang Lee]]'s drama ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005).

I wouldn't recommend that. Emily Blunt and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/hathaway%20starved%20on%20devil%20wears%20prada_1070987 |title=Anne Hathaway&nbsp;– Hathaway "Starved" on Devil Wears Prada |publisher=contactmusic.com |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}</ref>

Hathaway was cast in the 2007 comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]'', but dropped out before filming began and was replaced by [[Katherine Heigl]]. Writer/director [[Judd Apatow]] stated in a May 2007 issue of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' that this happened because "she didn't want to allow us to use real footage of a woman giving birth to create the illusion that she is giving birth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/06/18/the-vagina-mysteries/ |title=The Vagina Mysteries |publisher=TMZ.com |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}</ref> In an August 2008 interview with ''[[Marie Claire]]'', Hathaway commented that she "didn't believe that it was necessary to the story".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/celebrity/interviews/265792/anne-hathaway-interview.html |title=Anne Hathaway Interview |accessdate=August 17, 2008 |date=July 4, 2008 |work=[[Marie Claire]]}}</ref>

Hathaway was in the 2007 drama ''[[Becoming Jane]],'' in which she portrayed English writer [[Jane Austen]].<ref name="inside"/> [[Tim Burton]] considered Hathaway for the part of [[Johanna Barker]] in his 2007 film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]],'' but the role went to [[Jayne Wisener]], a then-unknown actress, reportedly because Burton decided he wanted an unknown, younger actress for the part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebrity.premiere.com/movie_stars/celebrity-trivia-Anne+Hathaway%20__193129 |title=Movie Star Biography&nbsp;– Anne Hathaway |work=Premiere |accessdate=October 19, 2009}}</ref>

===2011–present: widespread recognition===
[[File:Anne Hathaway 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne Hathaway at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]]]
In 2011, Hathaway voiced the character Jewel, a female [[Spix's Macaw]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]], in the [[animated film|animated]] adventure-comedy film ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'', produced by [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Blue Sky Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/rio/a/rio-cast-interview.htm |title=Inside ''Rio'' with Anne Hathaway, Jamie Foxx, and George Lopez |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews from film critics who praised the visuals, voice acting, and music.<ref name="RottenTomatoes">{{cite news| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rio| title=Rio| work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| publisher=Flixster| accessdate=April 6, 2011}}</ref> A commercial success, it went on to gross over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref>

Also in 2011, Hathaway starred alongside [[Jim Sturgess]] in the romance ''[[One Day (2011 film)|One Day]]''. Adapted by [[David Nicholls (writer)|David Nicholls]] from his 2009 [[One Day (novel)|novel of the same name]] and directed by [[Lone Scherfig]], the film tells the story of two young people who meet on the same day, July 15, for the twenty years after they share a one-night stand together at university. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script as ''One Day'' was set in the United Kingdom and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for Scherfig to listen to, which eventually led to Hathaway getting the part.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/11/one-day-with-hathaway |title='One Day' with Hathaway|first= Jim|last=Slotek|work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date= August 14, 2011|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> However, Hathaway's [[Yorkshire]] accent in the role of Emma was later widely regarded as subpar.
