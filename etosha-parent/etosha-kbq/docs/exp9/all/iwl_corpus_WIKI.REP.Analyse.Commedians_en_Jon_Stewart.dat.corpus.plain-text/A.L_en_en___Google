[[Google Analytics]] allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Bright, Peter |title=Surfing on the sly with IE8's new "InPrivate" Internet |url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/08/surfing-on-the-sly-ie8s-inprivate-internet.ars |date=August 27, 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's [[AdWords]] allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google [[AdSense]], allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.<ref name="AdSense">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/?sourceid=aso&subid=uk-en-ha&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=adsense&gsessionid=O---pJlnnf2wFZF8qu81Lg |title=AdSense |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}</ref>

One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of [[click fraud]], which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20&nbsp;percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.<ref>Mills, Elinor.

In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban|title= Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban|publisher=webpronews.com}}</ref> The policy was later changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/Terms.html|title= Google AdSense Online Standard Terms and Conditions |publisher=Google AdSense}}</ref> In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of [[Competition law|antitrust]] concerns by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal|last= Mclntyre|first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo!|last= Drummond|first=David|date= November 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010|publisher=Google, Inc}}</ref>

In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained about Google's indexing, claiming that Google's [[web cache|caching]] of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-1024234.html |title=Google cache raises copyright concerns |last1=Olsen |first1=Stefanie |date=July 9, 2003 |work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> In this case, the United States District Court of [[Nevada]] ruled in favor of Google in ''[[Field v.

Google also hosts [[Google Books]]. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books where allowed, into its new book search engine. The [[Authors Guild]], a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.<ref>{{cite web |first=China |last=Martin |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/google-hit-second-lawsuit-over-library-project-722 |title=Google hit with second lawsuit over Library project |publisher=[[InfoWorld]] |date=November 26, 2007}}</ref> Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Pettersson, Edvard|title=Google Wins Preliminary Approval of Online Books Settlement|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ahUxORgasDFs|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}</ref> Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ([[Éditions du Seuil]]) from its database.<ref name=Smith>{{Cite news|author=Smith, Heather|title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}</ref> In competition with [[Amazon.com]], Google sells digital versions of new books.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Rich, Motoko| title=Preparing to Sell E-Books, Google Takes on Amazon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/technology/internet/01google.html|date=May 31, 2009|work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 18, 2009 }}</ref>

On July 21, 2010, in response to [[Bing]], Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of [[thumbnail]]s that enlarge when pointed at.

One of its first projects was to develop a viable [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric vehicle]] that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired [[Larry Brilliant]] as the program's executive director in 2004,<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Hafner |first1=Katie |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html |title=Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and the current director is Megan Smith.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Helft |first1=Miguel |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/companies/24google.html |title=Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref>

===Tax avoidance===
Google uses various [[Tax avoidance|tax avoidance strategies]]. Out of the [[List of the largest information technology companies|five largest American technology companies]] it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. The company accomplishes this partly by licensing technology through [[Shell corporation|subsidiaries]] in [[Tax haven|Ireland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands]].<ref>Metz, Cade. [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/ "Google slips $3.1bn through 'Double Irish' tax loophole."] The Register, October 22, 2010.</ref> This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's [[transfer pricing]] practices.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leach |first=Anna |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |title=French gov 'plans to hand Google €1bn tax bill'&nbsp;– report. |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>

Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview Schmidt "confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer."<ref>{{cite news

Google Vice President [[Matt Brittin]] testified to the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brid-Aine Parnell, May 17, 2013 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/17/quotw_ending_may_17/ |title='I think you DO do evil, using smoke and mirrors to avoid tax'. |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref>

===Environment===
Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google's Green Initiative: Environmentally Conscious Technology|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/05/18/googles-green-initiative-environmentally-conscious-technology/|work=TechnoBuffalo|publisher=TechnoBuffalo LLC|accessdate=July 12, 2013|author=Jack McGrath|date=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.google.com/green/|work=Google Green|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=July 12, 2013|year=2013}}</ref>
Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, most due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google<ref>{{cite news|last=Glanz|first=James|title=Google Details, and Defends, Its Use of Electricity|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 24, 2014|newspaper=NY Times|date=September 8, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2013, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]] that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anatomy of a Washington dinner: Who funds the Competitive Enterprise Institute?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/20/anatomy-of-a-washington-dinner-who-funds-the-competitive-enterprise-institute/|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 20, 2013|author=Juliet Eilperin}}</ref>

In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], who has called climate change a "hoax".<ref>{{cite news|title=Google hosts fundraiser for climate change denying US senator|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jul/09/google-climate-denier-jim-inhofe|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 9, 2013|author=Suzanne Goldenberg|location=London}}</ref> In 2014 Google cut ties with the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists, because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.<ref name=LA>{{cite news|title=Google pulls out of conservative group amid environmentalist pressure|author=EVAN HALPER |date= September 23, 2014|work= Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-gop-20140924-story.html |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

===Lobbying===
In 2013, Google ranked 5th in [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, Google ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and internet sections.<ref name=lobby1>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-google-is-transforming-power-and-politicsgoogle-once-disdainful-of-lobbying-now-a-master-of-washington-influence/2014/04/12/51648b92-b4d3-11e3-8cb6-284052554d74_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop|title=Google, once disdainful of lobbying, now a master of Washington influence|work=[[The Washington Post]] | first1=Tom|last1=Hamburger|first2=Matea|last2=Gold|date=April 13, 2014}}</ref>
