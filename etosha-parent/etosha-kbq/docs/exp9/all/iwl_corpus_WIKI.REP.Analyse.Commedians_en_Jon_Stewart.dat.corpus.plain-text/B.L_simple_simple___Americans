'''Americans''' are [[citizen]]s of the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.census.gov United States Census]</ref> They are of many different [[ethnic group]]s and [[religion]]s, due to [[immigration]] from all over the world. 

Also, there are other groups that did not immigrate to the United States but became American because of American expansion in the late 19th century. These groups are people from [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and the [[Philippines]]. The Philippines is now an independent country.

In addition to the United States, Americans and people of American descent can be found around the world. Three to seven million Americans are estimated to be living outside the United States.

Most Americans are of European descent. The number of Latin Americans and Asians is more than ever. About 13% of Americans are of African descent. People from many cultures, religions and ethnicities live in the U.S. This is why the United States is called the "Melting Pot".

The United States is a [[Multiethnic society|diverse]] country. Six races are officially recognized by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] for statistical purposes: White, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.

The current population of Americans in the U.S. is 308,745,538.
