==The Three Branches==
The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is mostly about the President and is independent of the legislature. Legislative power is rights in the two chambers of Congress, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. 

The judicial branch (or judiciary), made of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, focuses on the [[Judiciary|judicial power]] (or judiciary). The judiciary's main focus is to change the meaning of the [[United States Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] and rules. This includes solving problems between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution.

These include greater power in the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the [[separation of powers]] between the legislature and the executive, and the [[dominant|dominance]] of only two main parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other developed country democracies.

The federal object created by the U.S. Constitution is the main feature of the American governmental system. However, most people are also subject to a [[U.S. state|state]] government, and all are subject to various units of local government. The latter include counties, municipalities, and special districts.

The federal government was created by the states, which as [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to carry out various state functions. As the country expanded, it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.

==State leaders==
In each state there are [[governor]]s. They are in charge of their state. They make and pass bills that would become laws in their countries. There are also two [[senator]]s who represent their state in congress. There are also [[representative]]s who represent a [[district]] in their state and also represent them in congress.
