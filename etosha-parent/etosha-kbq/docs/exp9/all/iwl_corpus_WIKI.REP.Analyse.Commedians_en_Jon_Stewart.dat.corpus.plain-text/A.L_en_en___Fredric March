'''Fredric March''' (born '''Ernest Frederick McIntyre Bickel'''; August 31, 1897 &ndash; April 14, 1975) was a "distinguished stage actor and one of Hollywood's most celebrated, versatile stars of the 1930s and 40s."<ref>http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/121733|56086/Fredric-March/</ref><ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', April 16, 1975, page 95.</ref> He won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1932 for ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' and in 1947 for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''. March is the only actor to have won both the Academy Award and the [[Tony Award]] twice.

==Early life==
March was born in [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], [[Wisconsin]], the son of Cora Brown Marcher (1863–1936), a schoolteacher, and John F. Bickel (1859–1941), a devout
[[Presbyterian]] Church [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] who worked in the wholesale hardware business.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/playeraprofileof002609mbp/playeraprofileof002609mbp_djvu.txt</ref> March attended the Winslow Elementary School (established in 1855), [[Racine High School]], and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] where he was a member of [[Alpha Delta Phi]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} He began a career as a banker, but an emergency [[appendectomy]] caused him to reevaluate his life, and in 1920 he began working as an extra in movies made in [[New York City]], using a shortened form of his mother's maiden name. He appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1926, and by the end of the decade signed a film contract with [[Paramount Pictures]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Career==
March received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for the [[4th Academy Awards]] in 1930 for ''[[The Royal Family of Broadway]]'', in which he played a role based upon [[John Barrymore]]. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the [[6th Academy Awards]] in 1932 for ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (tied with [[Wallace Beery]] for ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' although March accrued one more vote than Beery<ref name=Tranberg>{{cite book|last=Tranberg|first=Charles|title=Fredric March: A Consummate Actor|year=2013|publisher=BearManor Media|location=Duncan, Oklahoma|isbn=9781593937454}}</ref>), leading to a series of classic films based on stage hits and classic novels like ''[[Design for Living (film)|Design for Living]]'' (1933) with [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]], ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]'' (1934), ''[[Les Miserables (1935 film)|Les Misérables]]'' (1935) with [[Charles Laughton]], ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935) with [[Greta Garbo]], ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936) with [[Olivia de Havilland]], and as the original Norman Maine in ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star is Born]]'' (1937) with [[Janet Gaynor]], for which he received his third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination.

March resisted signing long-term contracts with the studios,<ref name=Tranberg /><ref>{{cite web|title=Fredric March: A Consummate Actor - An Interview with author Charles Tranberg|url=http://letsmisbehaveprecodefilmtribute.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/fredric-march-consummate-actor.html|work=Let's Misbehave: A Tribute to Precode Hollywood|publisher=Blogspot.com.au}}</ref>  enabling him to play roles in films from a variety of studios. He returned to Broadway after a ten-year absence in 1937 with a notable flop ''Yr. Obedient Husband'', but after the success of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'' he focused as much on [[Broadway theatre]] as [[Hollywood]]. He won two Best Actor [[Tony Awards]]: in 1947 for the play ''[[Years Ago (play)|Years Ago]]'', written by [[Ruth Gordon]]; and in 1957 for his performance as James Tyrone in the original Broadway production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s  ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''. He also had major successes in ''[[A Bell for Adano]]'' in 1944 and ''[[Gideon (play)|Gideon]]'' in 1961, and played [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' on Broadway in 1951. He also starred in such films as ''[[I Married a Witch]]'' (1942) and ''[[Another Part of the Forest (film)|Another Part of the Forest]]'' (1948) during this period, and won his second [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in 1946 for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''.

March also branched out into television, winning Emmy nominations for his third attempt at ''[[The Royal Family (play)|The Royal Family]]'' for the series ''[[The Best of Broadway]]'' as well as for television performances as [[Dodsworth (novel)|Samuel Dodsworth]] and [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. On March 25, 1954, March co-hosted the [[26th Academy Awards|26th Annual Academy Awards]] ceremony from [[New York City]], with co-host [[Donald O'Connor]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Previously, March had taken the role in ''The Desperate Hours'' originally offered to Tracy.  Both men had also played Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.]]

March's neighbor in Connecticut, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], was thought to favor March to inaugurate the part of [[Willy Loman]] in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949). However, March read the play and turned down the role, whereupon director [[Elia Kazan]] cast [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Willy, and [[Arthur Kennedy (actor)|Arthur Kennedy]] as one of Willy's sons, [[Biff Loman]], two men that the director had worked with in the film ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'' (1947). March later regretted turning down the role and finally played Willy Loman in [[Columbia Pictures]]'s [[Death of a Salesman (1951 film)|1951 film version of the play]], directed by [[Laslo Benedek]], receiving his fifth-and-final [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]].

March also played one of the two leads in ''[[The Desperate Hours (film)|The Desperate Hours]]'' (1955) with [[Humphrey Bogart]] when Bogart and [[Spencer Tracy]] both insisted upon top billing and Tracy withdrew, leaving the part available for March.

In 1957, March was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by [[George Eastman House]] for "distinguished contribution to the art of film."<ref>{{cite web| title=Awards granted by George Eastman House International Museum of Photography & Film|  url= http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php | publisher= [[George Eastman House]] | accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref>

On February 12, 1959, March appeared before a [[List of joint sessions of the United States Congress#1950s|joint session]] of the [[86th United States Congress]], reading of the [[Gettysburg Address]] as part of a commemorations of the 150th anniversary of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s birth.<ref>{{cite news| title= Nation Honor Lincoln On Sesquicentennial | url= http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1959summer/ishs-1959summer-291.pdf | date= February 11, 1959 | publisher= [[Northern Illinois University Libraries]] |work=[[Yonkers Herald-Statesman]] | agency = [[Associated Press]]| accessdate= April 25, 2013 | quote= Congress gets into the act tomorrow, when a joint session will be held.  [[Carl Sandburg]], famed Lincoln biographer, will give and address, and actor Fredric March will read the [[Gettysburg Address]].}}</ref>

March co-starred with Spencer Tracy in the 1960 Stanley Kramer film [[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]], in which he played a somewhat dramatized version of famous orator and political figure [[William Jennings Bryan]]. March's Bible-thumping character provided the perfect powerhouse rival for Tracy's Clarence Darrow-inspired character.  In the 1960s,  March's film career proceeded apace with a notable performance as President Jordan Lyman in the political thriller ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964) in which he co-starred with [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Kirk Douglas]], and [[Edmund O'Brien]]; the part earned March a nomination as Best Actor by Golden Globes.

March made several spoken word recordings, including a version of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales|The Selfish Giant]]'' issued in 1945, in which he narrated and played the title role, and ''[[The Sounds of History]]'', a twelve volume LP set accompanying the twelve volume set of books ''The [[Life Magazine|Life]] History of the United States'', published by [[Time-Life]]. The recordings were narrated by [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], with March and his wife Florence Eldridge performing dramatic readings from historical documents and literature.

Following surgery for [[prostate cancer]] in 1970, it seemed his career was over, yet he managed to give one last performance in ''[[The Iceman Cometh (1973 film)|The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1973), as the complicated Irish saloon keeper, Harry Hope.

==Personal life==
[[File:Fredric March in Best Years of Our Lives trailer.jpg|left|thumb|March in 1946]]

March was married to actress [[Florence Eldridge]] from 1927 until his death in 1975, and they had two adopted children.  He died from cancer, at age 77, in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; he was buried at his estate in [[New Milford, Connecticut]].

Throughout his life, he and his wife were supporters of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].

==Tributes==
March has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1616 Vine Street. In addition, the 500-seat [[theater]] at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]] is named after March,<ref>http://www.uwosh.edu/theatre/Theatre/ThFaci.html</ref> as well as the 168-seat Fredric March Play Circle Theater at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Memorial Union.<ref>http://www.union.wisc.edu/playcircle.htm</ref>
