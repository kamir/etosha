==Family and early life==
Alda was born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo on January 28, 1936, in New York City, and had a peripatetic childhood as his parents traveled around the United States in support of his father's job as a performer in burlesque theatres.<ref>Alan Alda, interviewed by Jian Ghomeshi, CBC Radio, March 28, 2013. In response to Ghomeshi's comment that Alda had grown up in the Bronx, Alda said, "No I didn't but I can tell you're a Wikipedia reader."</ref> His father, [[Robert Alda]] (born Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo), was an actor and singer, and his mother, Joan Browne, was a homemaker and former beauty pageant winner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alda|first=Alan|title=Alan Alda TV Legends Interview, Part I (13:25-14:30)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv92FNzH3Qc#t=874|work=Archive of American Television|publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref>   His father was of [[Italian American|Italian]] descent and his mother was of [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry.<ref name="ref1">{{Cite news|last=Berk|first=Philip|title=A question of roots|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 11, 1998|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19081701.html|accessdate=December 10, 2007}}</ref> His adopted surname, "Alda," is a [[portmanteau]] of ''AL''phonso and ''D'A''bruzzo.

When Alda was seven years old, he contracted [[poliomyelitis]]. To combat the disease, his parents administered a painful treatment regimen developed by [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Elizabeth Kenny]] that consisted of applying hot woollen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles.<ref>{{Cite news| first=Tavis | last=Smiley | title=Alan Alda | url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200412/20041202_alda.html | publisher=PBS | date=December 2, 2004 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}</ref> Alda attended [[Archbishop Stepinac High School]] in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], New York.<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' , 2000</ref>  In 1956, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Fordham College of [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx, where he was a student staff member of its [[FM radio]] station, [[WFUV]].

During Alda's junior year, he studied in Paris, acted in a play in Rome, and performed with his father on television in [[Amsterdam]]. In college, he was a member of the [[ROTC]], and after graduation, he served for a year at [[Fort Benning]], and then six months in the [[U.S. Army Reserve]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Delach|first=Brian|title=Alan Alda Gets Personal About Life After MASH|url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/entertainment/the-scene/Alan-Alda-Gets-Personal-About-the-Day-That-Changed-His-Life--206313811.html|newspaper=NBC Connecticut|date=May 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.militaryhub.com/military-people.cfm?id=4|title = Military People : Alan Alda |work=militaryhub.com| quote = After graduation, Alda joined the U.S. Army Reserve and served a six-month tour of duty in Korea. }}</ref>

==Career==

===Early acting===
[[File:Alan Alda circa 1960s.JPG|thumb|Alan Alda ''circa'' 1960s]]
Alda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the [[Compass Players]] comedy revue. In the November 1964 world premiere at the [[ANTA Playhouse]] of the stage version of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)#Background|The Owl and The Pussycat]]'', he played Felix the "Owl" opposite the "Pussycat" which was played by black actress/singer [[Diana Sands]].<ref>[http://mcclernan.blogspot.com/2014/06/strange-bedfellows.html "Strange Bedfellows"]</ref>  He continued to play Felix the "Owl" for the 1964-5 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] season.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2835 ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' on [[Internet Broadway Database|IBDB]]]</ref><ref>[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EH862BL5pts/U5EXOCQVy-I/AAAAAAAACkQ/nF-HEkifBQQ/s1600/op1.png ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' 1964 fall selection playbill cover]</ref>  In 1966, he starred in the musical ''[[The Apple Tree]]'' on Broadway; he was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] as Best Actor in a Musical for that role.

Although from away, Alan Alda says he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse.<ref>Alan Alda, interviewed by Diane Russell, Portland Magazine, Feb/March 2014. [http://www.portlandmonthly.com/portmag/2014/02/alda-ego/ "Alda Ego"]</ref>

Alda made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in ''Gone are the Days!'' – a film version of the highly successful Broadway play ''Purlie Victorious'', which co-starred veteran actors [[Ruby Dee]] and her husband, [[Ossie Davis]]. Other film roles would follow, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor [[George Plimpton]] in the film ''[[Paper Lion (film)|Paper Lion]]'' (1968),<ref name=tca/> as well as ''[[The Extraordinary Seaman]]'' (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller ''[[The Mephisto Waltz (film)|The Mephisto Waltz]]'', with actress [[Jacqueline Bisset]]. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of ''[[What's My Line?]]''. He also appeared as a panelist on ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' during its 1972 syndication revival.

===''M*A*S*H'' series (1972–83)===
[[File:MASH TV Cast 1972.jpg|thumb|200px|Alda (left of center) as Hawkeye Pierce in ''M*A*S*H'', 1972]]
In early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce" in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''.<ref name=tca/> He was nominated for 21 [[Emmy Award]]s, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the finale, and directed 32, including the finale. When he won his first Emmy Award for writing, he was so happy that he performed a [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]] before running up to the stage to accept the award. He was also the first person to win Emmy Awards for acting, writing, and directing for the same series.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} [[Richard Hooker (author)|Richard Hooker]], who wrote the novel on which ''M*A*S*H'' was based, did not like Alda's portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce (Hooker, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], had based Hawkeye on himself, whereas Alda and the show's writers took the character in a more liberal direction).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Alda also directed the show's 1983 2½-hour series finale "[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]", which remains [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|the single most-watched episode]] of any American broadcast network television series.<ref name=tca/> Alda is the only series regular to appear in all 251 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/mash/hawkeye/episode/43290/trivia.html?tag=cast_summary;trivia#notes |title=Hawkeye Trivia and Quotes |publisher=Tv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref>

Alda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in [[New Jersey]] every weekend for 11 years while starring in ''M*A*S*H''.<ref name="Alda2006">{{Cite book|last=Alda |first=Alan |year=2006 |title=Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned |location=New York |publisher=Random House |isbn=1-4000-6409-0}}</ref> His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey, and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last.

Alan Alda, father Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of ''M*A*S*H'', "Lend a Hand", during season 8. Robert had previously appeared in "The Consultant" in season 3.

[[File:Alan Alda Robert Alda MASH 1975.JPG|thumb|240px|Alan and [[Robert Alda]] in 1975]]
During the first five seasons of the series, the tone of ''M*A*S*H'' was largely that of a traditional "service comedy", in the vein of shows like ''[[McHale's Navy]]''. However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch,  ''M*A*S*H'' retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of ''M*A*S*H'' are generally split into two eras: the [[Larry Gelbart]]/[[Gene Reynolds]] "comedy" years (1972–1979), and the Alan Alda "dramatic" years (1979–1983).

For the first three seasons, Alda and his co-stars [[Wayne Rogers]] and [[McLean Stevenson]] worked well together, but later, tensions increased, particularly as Alda's role grew in popularity. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960217&slug=2314536 | work=The Seattle Times | title=Mclean Stevenson, 'Mash' Star | date=February 17, 1996}}</ref> At the beginning of the fourth season, Alda and the producers decided to find a replacement actor to play the surrogate parent role formerly taken by Colonel Blake. They eventually found veteran actor and fan of the series, [[Harry Morgan]], who would star as [[Colonel Sherman T. Potter]], becoming another of the show's protagonists.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/07/local/la-me-harry-morgan-20111115 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Stephanie | last=Stassel | title=Harry Morgan dies at 96; star of TV's 'MASH' | date=December 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Mike Farrell]] was also introduced as Alda's co-star [[BJ Hunnicutt]].

In his 1981 autobiography, [[Jackie Cooper]] (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper’s directing of ''M*A*S*H'' ended.<ref>Jackie Cooper, Please Don’t Shoot My Dog, Page 290, William Morrow & Company, 1981</ref>

During his ''M*A*S*H'' years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'' and as a frequent panelist on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.

His favorite episodes of ''M*A*S*H'' are "[[Dear Sigmund]]" and "In Love and War".<ref>M*A*S*H: The Martinis & Medicine Collection - Special Features: Disc 1 - "My Favorite MASH"</ref>

In 1996, Alda was ranked #41 on ''[[TV Guide]]'''s "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=December 14–20 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Post-''M*A*S*H''===
Alda's prominence in the enormously successful ''M*A*S*H'' gave him a platform to speak out on political topics, and he has been a strong and vocal supporter of [[women's rights]] and the [[Second-wave feminism|feminist movement]].<ref name=tca/> He co-chaired, with former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Betty Ford]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] Countdown campaign. In 1976, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' dubbed him "the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon" for his activism on behalf of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].<ref name="Alda, Alan: U.S. Actor">{{cite web|url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/aldaalan/aldaalan.htm|title = Alda, Alan: U.S. Actor|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}</ref>

Alda played Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in the play ''[[QED (play)|QED]]'', which had only one other character. Although [[Peter Parnell]] wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of [[Woody Allen]], and was a guest star five times on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', playing Dr. [[Kerry Weaver]]'s mentor, [[List of secondary doctors in ER#Gabriel Lawrence|Gabriel Lawrence]]. During the later episodes, Dr. Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Alda also had a co-starring role as [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]] in the 1993 TV movie ''[[And the Band Played On (film)|And the Band Played On]]''.

During ''M*A*S*H'''s run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble [[Comedy-drama|dramedy]] ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' being perhaps his most notable hit. ''[[Betsy's Wedding]]'' is his last directing credit to date. After ''M*A*S*H'', Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his "nice guy" image.<ref name=tca/>

==Later work==
[[File:Alan Alda Emmys 1994.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Alda at the 1994 Emmys]]
In 1993, he co-starred with [[Woody Allen]] (also the director), [[Diane Keaton]], and [[Anjelica Huston]] in the comedy/mystery ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]''. The four play a quartet of amateur crime solvers who become entangled in a murder plot possibly perpetrated by Keaton and Allen's neighbor. Alda's character is Ted, a playwright secretly in love with Keaton's character Carol, but who eventually falls for Huston's character Marcia.

From the fall season of 1993 until the show ended in 2005, Alda was the host for ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'', which began on [[PBS]] in 1990.<ref>{{Scientific American Frontiers|4}}</ref>

In 1995, he starred as the President of the United States in [[Michael Moore]]'s [[political satire]]/comedy film ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''. Around this time, rumors circulated that Alda was considering running for the [[United States Senate]] in [[New Jersey]], but he denied this. In 1996, Alda played [[Henry Ford]] in ''Camping With Henry and Tom'', based on the book by [[Mark St. Germain]] and appeared in the comedy film ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]''.

Beginning in 2004, Alda was a regular cast member on the [[NBC]] program ''[[The West Wing]]'', portraying [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and presidential candidate [[Arnold Vinick]], until the show's conclusion in May 2006. He made his premiere in the sixth season's eighth episode, "In The Room", and was added to the opening credits with the 13th episode, "King Corn." In August 2006, Alda won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for his portrayal of Arnold Vinick in the final season of ''The West Wing''. Alda had been a serious candidate, along with [[Sidney Poitier]], for the role of [[Josiah Bartlet|President Josiah Bartlet]] before [[Martin Sheen]] was ultimately cast in the role.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 2004, Alda portrayed conservative Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] in [[Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese's]] Academy Award-winning film ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].

Throughout his career, Alda has received 31 [[Emmy Award]] nominations and two [[Tony Award]] nominations, and has won seven [[People's Choice Awards]], six [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and three [[Directors Guild of America]] awards. However, it was not until 2005, after a long acting career, that Alda received his first [[Academy Award]] nomination, for his role in ''The Aviator''.

Alda also wrote several of the stories and poems that appeared in [[Marlo Thomas|Marlo Thomas's]] television show ''[[Free to Be... You and Me]]''.

Alda starred in the original Broadway production of the play ''[['Art']]'', which opened on March 1, 1998, at the [[Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre]]. The play won the Tony Award for best original play.

Alda also had a part in the 2000 romantic comedy ''[[What Women Want]]'', as the CEO of the advertising firm where the main characters worked.

In the spring of 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the [[Tony Award]]-winning Broadway revival of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Throughout 2009 and 2010, he appeared in three episodes of ''[[30 Rock]]'' as Milton Greene, the biological father of [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]). In January 2010, Alda hosted ''The Human Spark'', a three-part series originally broadcast on PBS discussing the nature of human uniqueness and recent studies on the human brain.

In 2011, Alda was scheduled to guest star on ''[[Law & Order: LA]]'', portraying former police and naval officer John Winters, the father of the former main character [[List of Law & Order: Los Angeles characters#Rex Winters|Rex Winters]]. It is unknown whether he filmed his role before the series was redesigned and Rex Winters written off.

After the release of the movie ''[[Tower Heist]]'', Alda was devastated when on December 7, 2011, he lost his idol and decades-long friend [[Harry Morgan]] from ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. Upon Morgan's death, Alda released a statement referring to a ''M*A*S*H'' reunion event two years before: "We had just a wonderful time reminiscing. That was the last time I saw Harry."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Nation/2011/12/08/Harry-Morgan-1915-2011-Actor-most-remembered-as-Col-Potter-of-M-A-S-H.html|title=Harry Morgan, 1915-2011: Actor most remembered as Col. Potter of 'M*A*S*H'|date=December 8, 2011|work=The Toledo Blade|author=|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}</ref>

Alda returned to Broadway in November 2014, playing the role of Andrew Makepeace in the revival of ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' at the [[Brooks Atkinson Theater]] alongside with [[Candice Bergen]].<ref>[http://www.broadway.com/buzz/178311/candice-bergen-alan-alda-step-into-ar-gurneys-love-letters-on-broadway/ ''Broadway.com:'' "Candice Bergen & Alan Alda Step into A.R. Gurney’s Love Letters on Broadway"]</ref>

==Charitable work and other interests==
Alda has done extensive charity work. He helped narrate a 2005 [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude's Children's Hospital]] produced one-hour special TV show ''Fighting for Life''.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Saint Jude Children's Hospital | first=Web Editor | title=Saint Jude TV – Fighting For Life | publisher=Saint Jude Web Site | date=December 1, 2005 | url=http://www.stjude.tv/ | accessdate=April 11, 2007 | postscript=<!--None-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070316091359/http://www.stjude.tv/| archivedate= March 16, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He and his wife, Arlene, are also close friends of [[Marlo Thomas]], who is very active in fund-raising for the hospital [[Danny Thomas|her father]] founded. The special featured [[Ben Bowen]] as one of six patients being treated for childhood cancer at Saint Jude. Alda and Marlo Thomas had also worked together in the early 70s on a critically acclaimed children's album entitled ''[[Free to Be You and Me]]'', which featured Alda, Thomas and a number of other well-known character actors. This project remains one of the earliest public signs of his support of women's rights.

In 2005, Alda published his first round of memoirs, ''Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned''.<ref name="Alda2006" /> Among other stories, he recalls his [[intestine]]s becoming strangulated while on location in [[La Serena, Chile]] for his PBS show ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'', during which he mildly surprised a young doctor with his understanding of medical procedures, which he had learned from ''M*A*S*H''. He also talks about his mother's battle with [[schizophrenia]]. The title comes from an incident in his childhood, when Alda was distraught about his dog dying and his well-meaning father had the animal [[taxidermy|stuffed]]. Alda was horrified by the results, and took from this that sometimes we have to accept things as they are, rather than desperately and fruitlessly trying to change them.

In 2006, Alda contributed his voice to a part in the audio book of [[Max Brooks]]' ''[[World War Z]]''. In this book, he voiced Arthur Sinclair Jr., the director of the United States Government's fictional "Department of Strategic Resources (DeStRes)".

His second memoir, ''Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself'', weaves together advice from public speeches he has given with personal recollections about his life and beliefs.

Alda also has an avid interest in [[cosmology]], and participated in [[BBC]] coverage of the opening of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], at [[CERN]], Geneva, in September 2008.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC Web Site | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/bigbang/physics_rocks.shtml | title= Big Bang Day: Physics Rocks |date = September 10, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080910042225/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/bigbang/physics_rocks.shtml| archivedate= September 10, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

After years of interviews, Alda helped inspire the creation of the [[Center for Communicating Science]] at [[Stony Brook University]] in 2009.  He remains on the advisory board as of 2013.<ref name=board>{{cite web|title=Advisory Board: Alan Alda|url=http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/classifications/advisory-board/|work=November 17, 2010|publisher=Center For Communicating Science|accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref> He was named an Honorary Fellow by the Society for Technical Communication in 2014 for his work with the Center for Communicating Science and the annual Flame Challenge.<ref name="Honorary Fellow">{{cite web|title=Alan Alda Named STC Honorary Fellow|url=http://notebook.stc.org/alan-alda-named-stc-honorary-fellow/|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>  He is also on the advisory board of the Future of Life Institute.<ref name="fli"/>

Alda has been a feminist activist for many years.<ref name="Alda, Alan: U.S. Actor"/> He co-chaired, with former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Betty Ford]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] Countdown campaign. In 1976, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' dubbed him "the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon" for his activism on behalf of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].<ref name="Alda, Alan: U.S. Actor"/>

==Religious views==
In ''Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself'', Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or [[Atheism|atheist]]:

<blockquote>For a while in my teens, I was sure I had it. It was about getting to heaven. If heaven existed and lasted forever, then a mere lifetime spent scrupulously following orders was a small investment for an infinite payoff. One day, though, I realized I was no longer a believer, and realizing that, I couldn’t go back. Not that I lost the urge to pray. Occasionally, even after I stopped believing, I might send off a quick memo to the Master of the Universe, usually on a matter needing urgent attention, like Oh, God, don’t let us crash. These were automatic expulsions of words, brief SOS messages from the base of my brain. They were similar to the short prayers that were admired by the church in my Catholic boyhood, which they called “ejaculations.” I always liked the idea that you could shorten your time in purgatory with each ejaculation; what boy wouldn’t find that a comforting idea? But my effort to keep the plane in the air by talking to God didn’t mean I suddenly was overcome with belief, only that I was scared. Whether I’d wake up in heaven someday or not, whatever meaning I found would have to occur first on this end of eternity.</blockquote>

Speaking further on agnosticism, Alda goes on to say:<blockquote>I still don't like the word agnostic. It's too fancy. I'm simply not a believer. But, as simple as this notion is, it confuses some people. Someone wrote a ''Wikipedia'' entry about me, identifying me as an atheist because I'd said in a book I wrote that I wasn't a believer. I guess in a world uncomfortable with uncertainty, an unbeliever must be an atheist, and possibly an infidel. This gets us back to that most pressing of human questions: why do people worry so much about other people's holding beliefs other than their own?</blockquote> Alda made these comments in an interview for the 2008 question section of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] website.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2008 – page 8 | publisher=Edge Foundation Web Site | year=2008 | url=http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html#alda | accessdate=January 2, 2008 | postscript=<!--None-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080102154225/http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html| archivedate= January 2, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

His most famous character, Dr. Benjamin "Hawkeye" Pierce on [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]], was reputed to be agnostic, but he often was shown attending Sunday services and maintained a close friendship with the camp's chaplain, [[Father Mulcahy|Fr. Francis Mulcahy]]. A tenth-season episode depicted Hawkeye serving at the front and fearfully writing his will, where he left five cents to the Father, explaining, "I know you are a spiritual man and material things mean little to you, but I leave you one other thing: my everlasting respect."
