'''''The Simpsons''''' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Matt Groening]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ortved|first=John|title=The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jcJMPiM0tCwC&pg=PA287|accessdate=February 2, 2014|date=October 12, 2010|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0-86547-939-5|page=287}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Facts On File, Incorporated|title=Animation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GXwBT9CuU-sC&pg=PA9|accessdate=February 2, 2014|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-3249-5|page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Irwin|first1=William|last2=Conard|first2=Mark T.|last3=Skoble|first3=Aeon J.|title=The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SjKhSR33J8gC&pg=PA1972|accessdate=February 2, 2014|date=August 21, 2013|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9694-3|page=1972}}</ref> The series is a [[satirical]] depiction of a [[American middle class|middle class American]] lifestyle epitomized by the [[Simpson family]], which consists of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and parodies [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], [[Society of the United States|society]], television, and many aspects of the [[human condition]].

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with the producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour [[prime time]] show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the series has broadcast [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{The Simpsons episode count}} episodes]],<!-- The episode number is updated in the template "The Simpsons episode count". Please do not update it directly in this article. --> and the [[The Simpsons (season 26)|26th season]] began on September 28, 2014. ''The Simpsons'' is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed ''[[Gunsmoke#Television version|Gunsmoke]]'' as the longest-running American scripted primetime television series. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. On October 28, 2014, executive producer Al Jean announced that season 27 had started production,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/AlJean/status/527139156636348416|title=Twitter|work=twitter.com}}</ref> renewing the series through the 2015–16 season.<ref name="metacritic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-renewal-scorecard-2014-2015-season|title=List of Renewed and Canceled TV Shows for 2014-15 Season (with Metascores) - Metacritic|work=metacritic.com}}</ref> On May 4, 2015, the series was officially renewed for seasons 27 and 28.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'The Simpsons' Renewed by FOX for 27th and 28th Seasons|url = http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/05/04/the-simpsons-renewed-by-fox-for-27th-and-28th-seasons/399265/|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}</ref>

''The Simpsons'' has received widespread critical acclaim. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993039,00.html|title=The Best of the Century|work=TIME}}</ref> and ''[[The A.V.

It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 30 [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Peabody Award]]. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase "[[D'oh!]]" has been adopted into the English language, while ''The Simpsons'' has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.<!--The impending Futurama/Family Guy crossovers are mentioned in the 'Influence on TV' section.

===Characters===
{{Main|List of The Simpsons characters}}
[[File:Simpsons cast.png|thumb|left|500px|''The Simpsons'' sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.]]
The Simpsons are a family who live in a fictional "[[Middle America (United States)|Middle American]]" town of Springfield.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], a position at odds with his careless, [[jester|buffoonish]] personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] American [[Homemaking|housewife]] and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a [[pacifier]]. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.<ref>{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The family owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, [[Simpson family#Snowball V (Snowball II)|Snowball V]], renamed [[Simpson family#Snowball II|Snowball II]] in "[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |episodelink=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |series=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=2004-01-11}}</ref> Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.

The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.<ref name="avclub1">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=October 22, 2006 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=April 26, 2006 |publisher=The A.V. Club}}</ref>

Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a [[floating timeline]] in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks/forwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced.<ref>For example, in the 1991 episode "[[I Married Marge]]", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 81. But in the 1995 episode "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 94.</ref>

==Production==

===Development===
{{Main|History of The Simpsons|The Simpsons shorts}}
When producer [[James L. Brooks]] was working on the television variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his ''Life in Hell'' series.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video |year=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family |medium=television documentary |publisher=BBC}}</ref> However, Groening later realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a [[dysfunctional family]] that became the Simpsons.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/><ref name=inter>{{cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subjectlink=Matt Groening |interviewer=David Bianculli |title=Fresh Air |program=[[NPR]] |callsign=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008 |city=Philadelphia |date=February 14, 2003 |accessdate=August 8, 2007}}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name, adopting an [[anagram]] of the word "brat".<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/>

The Simpson family first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' on April 19, 1987.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14}} Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> The animation was produced domestically at [[Klasky Csupo]],<ref name="animation">{{cite journal |first=Harvey |last=Deneroff |title=Matt Groening's Baby Turns 10 |journal=Animation |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=10, 12}}</ref>{{sfn|Beck|2005 |p=239}} with [[Wes Archer]], [[David Silverman]], and [[Bill Kopp]] being animators for the first season.<ref name="silverman"/> Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.<ref name="silverman"/>

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer' |accessdate=September 1, 2006 |last=Kuipers |first=Dean |date=April 15, 2004 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.<ref name="toonterrific">{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Tucker |title=Toon Terrific |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 12, 1993 |page=48(3)}}</ref> The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-1_episode-1 |title=Simpsons Roasting on and Open Fire |publisher=The Simpsons.com |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems.<ref>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In 1992, [[Tracey Ullman]] filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success.

==Themes==
{{Main|Media in The Simpsons|Politics in The Simpsons|Religion in The Simpsons}}

''The Simpsons'' uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} serving as a [[satire|satirical]] parody of a [[American middle class|middle class American]] lifestyle.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Simpsons: Culture, Class and Popular TV |author=Flew, Terry |work=Metro |issue=97 |date=March 3, 1994 |url=http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&whichpage=12&pagesize=15}}</ref> However, because of its animated nature, ''The Simpsons''' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=55}} Through Bart and Lisa's days at [[Springfield Elementary School]], the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=388}}

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=221–222}} [[Al Jean]] admitted in an interview that "We [the show] are of liberal bent."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=223}} The writers often evince an appreciation for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal ideals]], but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=224}} The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=223}} Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=56}} Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark I |last=Pinsky |title=The Gospel According to Homer |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=August 15, 1999}}</ref>

==Hallmarks==

===Opening sequence===
{{Main|The Simpsons opening sequence}}
''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Title sequence|opening sequence]] is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4682314/The-Simpsons-opening-sequence-changes.html |title='The Simpsons' opening sequence changes |last=Leonard |first=Tom |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=March 2, 2009 |date=February 17, 2009 |location=London}}</ref> Each has the same basic sequence of events: The camera zooms through [[cumulus cloud]]s, through the show's title towards the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by [[David Silverman]], and was the first task he did when production began on the show.<ref name=silverinter>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml |title=Top titles |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> The series' distinctive [[The Simpsons Theme|theme song]] was [[composer|composed]] by musician [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.<ref name="elfman">{{cite web |url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20111001024519/http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html |archivedate=October 1, 2011 |title=Danny Elfman in the L.A. Times |accessdate=July 3, 2006 |last=Glionna |first=John M. |year=1999 |publisher=Danny Elfman's Music for a Darkened People}}</ref>

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard,<ref name=silverinter/> Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=90–91}}

===Halloween episodes===
[[File:Bart Night Gallery.jpg|thumb|Bart Simpson introducing a segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" in the manner of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'']]
{{Main|Treehouse of Horror (series)}}
The special [[Halloween]] episode has become an annual tradition. "[[Treehouse of Horror]]" first broadcast in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode.<ref name="BBCI">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml |title=The Simpsons Halloween Special |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |last=Martyn |first=Adrian |last2=Wood |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> These pieces usually involve the family in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=31}} They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the ''Treehouse'' series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s, when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]'s current contract with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII |last=Ryan |first=Andrew |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=November 4, 2006 |page=12}}</ref> however, as of 2011 every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode has aired during the month of October.

===Humor===
The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=63–65}} The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=62}} Kristin Thompson argues that ''The Simpsons'' uses a "flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show."{{sfn|King|2002}}

One of Bart's early hallmarks was his prank calls to [[Moe's Tavern]] owner [[Moe Szyslak]] in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a [[gag name]]. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the [[Tube Bar prank calls|Tube Bar recordings]], though Groening has denied any causal connection.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-03/news/vw-42985_1_prank-calls Telephone Trespassing : Think only kids make prank calls? Now grown-ups are dialing, baiting their prey and taping what follows. And thousands collect the recordings.] Mark Ehrman. Los Angeles Times. 1993-06-03. Accessed 2015-04-20.

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=60}} Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", Mr. Burns' "Excellent" and [[Nelson Muntz]]'s "''Ha''-ha!". Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as "''[[¡Ay, caramba!]]''", "[[Don't have a cow]], man!" and "Eat my shorts!" appeared on T-shirts in the show's early days.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=25}} However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the [[merchandising]]. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode "[[Bart Gets Famous]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the ''Krusty the Clown Show'' solely for saying "I didn't do it."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=61}}

===Television===
''The Simpsons'' was the first successful animated program in American prime time since ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' in the 1970s.{{sfn|Alberti|2003 |p=xii}} During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. ''The Simpsons'' changed this perception.<ref name="animation"/> The use of Korean animation studios for [[inbetweening|tweening]], coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of ''The Simpsons'' and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series.<ref name="animation"/> This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[The Critic]]''.<ref name="animation"/> For ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], "''The Simpsons'' created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years&nbsp;... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708 |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |date=August 2007 |title=Simpson Family Values |first=John |last=Ortved |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref>

''The Simpsons'' has had crossovers with three other shows. In the episode "[[A Star Is Burns]]", Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of ''The Critic'', to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield. Matt Groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with ''The Critic''.<ref name="LATimes"/> In "[[Simpsorama]]", the Planet Express crew from ''Futurama'' come to Springfield in the present to prevent the Simpsons from destroying the future.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/20/the-simpsons-futurama-crossover-epsidoe/ |title='The Simpsons' to join forces with 'Futurama' for crossover episode |work=Entertainment Weekly |author=Snierson, Dan |date=July 20, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref> In the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", the Griffins visit Springfield and meet the Simpsons.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23373451 |title=Simpsons in Family Guy crossover |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |date=July 19, 2013}}</ref> ''South Park'' later paid homage to ''The Simpsons'' with the episode "[[Simpsons Already Did It]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1647331,00.html |title=The Simpsons, Bigger and Better |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |date=July 29, 2007 |author=Richard Corliss |work=Time}}</ref> In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the animated television sitcom ''[[The Samsonadzes]]'', launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with ''The Simpsons'', which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8494926.stm |title=Putin appears in Georgia's Simpsons-like cartoon show |publisher=BBC |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/georgias-answer-to-the-simpsons-1844272.html |title=Georgia's answer to 'The Simpsons' |work=[[The Independent]] |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/news/samsonadzes-simpsons-cartoon-georgia/ |title=Georgian Simpsons-like movie: feel the difference |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref>

Schembri wrote: "The central tragedy of ''The Simpsons'' is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself.

[[Al Jean]], showrunner since season thirteen, has also been the subject of criticism, with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure.

In 2013 the [[cable television|cable]] television network [[FXX]] acquired [[broadcast syndication]] rights for ''The Simpsons'' for a reported $750 million, a deal which broke the record for being the biggest off-network deal in television history. Original contracts had previously stated that syndication rights for ''The Simpsons'' would not be sold to cable until the series conclusion; however, the series has been syndicated to several local broadcast stations throughout the United States since 1993.<ref name=Simpsons>[http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/fxx-lands-the-simpsons-in-the-biggest-off-network-deal-in-tv-history/#more-635800 FXX Lands 'The Simpsons' In Biggest Off-Network Deal In TV History] ''Deadline Hollywood'', November 15, 2013</ref>

FXX premiered ''The Simpsons'' on their network on August 21, 2014 by starting a twelve-day [[Marathon (television)|marathon]] which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including ''The Simpsons Movie'', which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air.

The popularity of ''The Simpsons'' has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry.<ref name="mikescully"/> The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. ''The Simpsons'' has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including [[Cluedo|Clue]], [[Scrabble]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], [[Operation (game)|Operation]], and [[The Game of Life]], as well as the [[trivia]] games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons [[Jeopardy!]]. Several card games such as [[Trump|trump cards]] and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial ''Simpsons'' books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years.
