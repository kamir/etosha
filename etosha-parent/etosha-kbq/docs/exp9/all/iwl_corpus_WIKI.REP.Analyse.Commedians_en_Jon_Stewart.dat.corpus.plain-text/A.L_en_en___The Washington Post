'''''The Washington Post''''' is an American [[daily newspaper]]. It is the most widely circulated [[newspaper]] published in [[Washington, D.C.]], and was founded in 1877, making it the area's oldest extant newspaper.

Located in the capital city of the United States, the newspaper has a particular emphasis on national politics. Daily editions are printed for the [[District of Columbia]], [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The newspaper is published as a [[broadsheet]], with photographs printed both in color and in black and white.

The newspaper has won [[List of prizes won by The Washington Post|47 Pulitzer Prizes]]. This includes six separate [[2008 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzers awarded in 2008]], the second-highest number ever given to a single newspaper in one year.<ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |authorlink=Howard Kurtz |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/07/AR2008040701359_2.html?hpid=artslot&sid=ST2008040701372 |title=The Post Wins 6 Pulitzer Prizes |work=The Washington Post |date= April 8, 2008 |accessdate= August 8, 2008}}</ref> ''Post'' journalists have also received 18 [[Nieman Fellowship]]s and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards. In the early 1970s, in the best-known episode in ''Post'' history, reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] led the American press's investigation into what became known as the [[Watergate scandal]]; reporting in the newspaper greatly contributed to the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]]. In years since, its investigations have led to increased review of the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/walter-reed/index.html |title=Walter Reed and Beyond |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate= May 25, 2010}}</ref>

==Overview==
''The Post'' is generally regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/us/51/474/6821 |title=Washington Post - Daily Newspaper in Washington DC, USA with Local News and Events |publisher=Mondo Code LLC |date= |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}</ref> along with ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. ''The Post'' has distinguished itself through its [[political journalism|political reporting]] on the workings of the [[White House]], [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], and other aspects of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].

Unlike ''The New York Times'' and ''Wall Street Journal'', ''The Washington Post'' does not print an edition for distribution away from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].  In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its ''National Weekly Edition'', which combined stories from the week's print editions, due to shrinking circulation.<ref>{{cite news | title= Post's National Weekly Edition to Close | url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ombudsman-blog/2009/08/posts_national_weekly_edition.html | work= The Washington Post | accessdate= June 2, 2011}}</ref> The majority of its newsprint readership is in [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and its suburbs in [[Maryland]] and [[Northern Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpostads.com/adsite/why/media/reach/page1450.html|work=Washington Post Media|title=The Washington Post's Circulation and Reach|accessdate= March 2, 2009}}</ref>

The newspaper's weekday and Saturday printings include the following sections:{{when|date=January 2014}}<!-- when was this particular list current?  a citation would help answer that question. -->

*Metro section, containing local news
*Style section, with feature writing on pop culture, politics, fine and performing arts, film, fashion, and gossip, along with advice columns and comics
*Sports section
*[[Classified advertising]]

Sunday editions largely include the weekday sections as well as Outlook (opinion), Arts, Travel, Comics, TV Week, and the ''Washington Post Magazine''. The ''Sunday Style'' section differs slightly from the weekday Style section; it is in a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, and it houses the reader-written humor contest [[The Style Invitational]].

Additional weekly sections appear on weekdays: Health & Science on Tuesday, Food on Wednesday, Local Living (home and garden) on Thursday, and Weekend, with details about upcoming events in the local area, on Friday. The latter two are in a tabloid format.

==History==

===Founding and early period===
[[File:Sign, "Welcome Home From the Crow-Eaters," on the front of the Washington Post Building in Washington, DC. President... - NARA - 199955.jpg|thumb|Washington Post building in 1948]]
The newspaper was founded in 1877 by [[Stilson Hutchins]] (1838–1912) and in 1880 added a Sunday edition, thus becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week. In 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the [[United States Marine Band]], [[John Philip Sousa]], to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed ''[[The Washington Post (march)|The Washington Post]]''. It became the standard music to accompany the [[Two-step (dance move)|two-step]], a late 19th-century [[dance craze]],<ref>[http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/r-rosas/souscoll.htm John Philip Sousa Collection] from the website of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]</ref> and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.

In 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]], ''The Post'' printed [[Clifford K. Berryman]]'s classic illustration ''[[Remember the Maine]],'' which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in ''The Post''—''Drawing the Line in Mississippi.'' This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner [[Morris Michtom]] to create the [[teddy bear]].<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/ead/ms2024.xml "Clifford K. Berryman Cartoon Collection"]. Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, [[George Washington University]].</ref>

Wilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death. After Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran ''The Post'' for two years before selling it in 1905 to [[John Roll McLean]], owner of the ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]''. During the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] presidency, ''The Post'' was credited with the "most famous newspaper [[typo]]" in D.C. history according to ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine; ''The Post'' intended to report that President Wilson had been "entertaining" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been "entering" Mrs. Galt.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rabbe|first=Will|title=The Washington Post's Famous 1915 Typo|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/08/06/washington-post-famous-wilson-typo/|newspaper=MSNBC|date=June 8, 2013}}</ref><ref name=tws5nov01>{{cite journal|author=Freund, Charles Paul|title=D.C.

Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin.

===Meyer-Graham period===
The newspaper was purchased in a bankruptcy auction in 1933 by the former [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]]'s board of governors, [[Eugene Meyer]], who restored the newspaper's health and reputation. In 1946, Meyer was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, [[Philip Graham]].

In 1954, the newspaper consolidated its position by acquiring and merging with its last morning rival, the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. (The combined paper was officially named '''''The Washington Post and Times-Herald''''' until 1973, although the ''Times-Herald'' portion of the [[nameplate (publishing)|nameplate]] became less and less prominent after the 1950s.) The merger left ''The Post'' with two remaining local competitors, the afternoon ''[[Washington Star]]'' (''Evening Star'') and ''[[The Washington Daily News]]'', which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981. ''[[The Washington Times]]'', established in 1982 by a subsidiary of the [[Unification Church]], led by the Rev. [[Sun Myung Moon]] (1920–2012), has been a local conservative rival with a circulation ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}) about one-seventh that of ''The Post''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/business/20050518-120247-7729r.htm |title=Times Circulation Climbs To Buck Trend |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=May 18, 2005 |accessdate=April 4, 2009}}</ref> In the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with the foundation of the tabloid [[Washington Examiner|"The Examiner" of Washington]] by the new owners of the old [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] paper, the ''"[[San Francisco Examiner]]"'' who engineered a swap trading the larger, more prosperous ''"[[San Francisco Chronicle]]"'' for the former Hearst "flagship" paper. They also started several other tabloid ''"Examiners"'' in several American cities, including briefly for two years in ''"[[Baltimore|Baltimore Examiner]]"'' going against the 170-year old ''"[[Baltimore Sun]]"''.
[[File:Land on the Moon 7 21 1969-repair.jpg|thumb|The Monday, July 21, 1969, edition, with the headline [[Apollo 11|"'The Eagle Has Landed']]&nbsp;— Two Men Walk on the Moon"]]

After Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to [[Katharine Graham]] (1917–2001), his wife and Meyer's daughter. Few women had run nationally prominent newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence based on her gender in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979 and headed The Washington Post Company into the early 1990s as chairman of the board and CEO. After 1993, she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001.

Her tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that ''The New York Times'' did not surpass its Washington reporting of the [[Pentagon Papers]] and Watergate scandal. During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company [[Kaplan, Inc.]] for $40 million in 1984.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-trials-of-kaplan-higher-ed-and-the-education-of-the-washington-post-co/2011/03/20/AFsGuUAD_story.html The trials of Kaplan Higher Ed and the education of The Washington Post Co.], ''Washington Post'', Steven Mufson and Jia Lynn Yang, April 9, 2011.</ref> Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/02/08/don-graham-washington-post/3/ Nice Guy, Finishing Last: How Don Graham Fumbled the Washington Post Co.], ''[[Forbes]]'', Jeff Bercovici, February 8, 2012.</ref>

Executive editor [[Ben Bradlee]], a Kennedy loyalist, put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of [[Democratic National Committee]] offices in the [[Watergate complex|Watergate Hotel]] complex in Washington. ''The Post''{{'s}} dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]], won the newspaper a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973.

In 1972, the "Book World" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize–winning critic [[William McPherson (writer)|William McPherson]] as its first editor.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/25thann/aranaward.htm |title=Views From Publisher's Row |first=Marie |last=Arana-Ward (then-deputy editor of "Book World") |authorlink=Marie Arana |date= June 1, 1997 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> It featured Pulitzer Prize–winning critics such as [[Jonathan Yardley]] and [[Michael Dirda]], the latter of whom established his career as a critic at ''The Post''. In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, "The Washington Post Book World" as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009, along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the "Outlook" section and distributing some other locally oriented "op-ed" letters and commentaries in other sections.<ref name=lastbook>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/12/AR2009021203265.html Letter from the editor], ''The Washington Post'', Sunday, February 15, 2009; Page BW02</ref> However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.<ref name=lastbook/>

In 1980, the newspaper published a dramatic story called "Jimmy's World",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/markport/lit/litjour/spg2002/cooke.htm |title=Jimmy's World |author=Cooke, Janet |authorlink=Janet Cooke |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]]|date=September 28, 1980 |accessdate=April 4, 2009}}</ref> describing the life of an eight-year-old [[heroin]] addict in Washington, for which reporter [[Janet Cooke]] won acclaim and a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Subsequent investigation, however, revealed the story to be a fabrication. The Pulitzer Prize was returned.

[[Donald E. Graham]], Katharine's son, succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board. He was succeeded in 2000 as publisher and CEO by [[Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr.]], with Graham remaining as chairman.

Katharine Graham Weymouth now serves as publisher and chief executive officer.

===Post-Graham period===
In 1996, the newspaper established a [[website]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/07/AR2008070701835.html |title=The Post's New Executive Editor Once Headed Wall Street Journal |last=Kurtz|first= Howard |authorlink=Howard Kurtz |date= July 7, 2008|work=The Washington Post|accessdate= July 7, 2008}}</ref>

In 2008, [[Marcus Brauchli]] replaced long-time executive editor [[Leonard Downie, Jr.]], serving publisher [[Katharine Weymouth]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/business/media/the-washington-post-recast-for-a-digital-future.html?ref=technology&pagewanted=all |title=A Newspaper, and a Legacy, Reordered |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2012 |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, the newspaper cited its local focus as a reason for running its first-ever front-page advertisement: the [[Capital One]] ad was being run to draw attention to the rebranding of [[Chevy Chase Bank]], a bank Capital One bought in 2009. According to the Post's vice president of advertising, the page one advertisement is a "...very local, useful-information-for-our-readers type of campaign."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Headlines/washington-post-front-page-ad-a-first-for-now-62608-.aspx |title=Washington Post Front-Page Ad: A First, For Now |date= September 14, 2010 |publisher=Editor & Publisher}}</ref>

In November 2012, Weymouth announced that ''[[Boston Globe]]'' editor Martin Baron would take over Brauchli's position on January 2, 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/marcus-brauchli-to-step-down-as-editor-of-the-washington-post/2012/11/13/952698e0-2daf-11e2-a99d-5c4203af7b7a_story.html |title=Marcus Brauchli to Step Down As Editor of The Washington Post |last=Farhi |first=Paul |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/new-top-editor-at-washington-post-brauchli-to-be-replaced-by-marty-baron |title=New Top Editor at Washington Post: Marcus Brauchli to Be Replaced by Martin Baron |last=Haughney |first=Christine |date=November 13, 2012 |work=The New York Times}}{{Dead link |date=August 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, the newspaper announced that it has plans to start charging frequent users of its website, with many exceptions (such as for government employees browsing from work, and for students browsing from school).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-washington-post-to-charge-frequent-web-users/2013/03/18/adc0ba46-8fe5-11e2-bdea-e32ad90da239_story.html|title=The Washington Post To Charge Frequent Users of Its Web Site|publisher=The Washington Post|author=Steve Mufson|date=March 19, 2013}}{{fix|text=Registration may be required|link=WP:V#Access to sources|title=This Page May Prompt for Registration, or It Might Not.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2013/03/18/washington-post-plans-to-charge-online-users |author=Matthew Rocco |work=[[Fox Business]] |title=Washington Post Plans to Charge Online Users}}</ref>  As of March 2013, pricing has not been determined yet.

[[Jeff Bezos]] purchased the newspaper for $250 million in cash, completing the transaction on October 1, 2013, after announcing the planned [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] on August 5, 2013.<ref name=fahri2013a/><ref name=clabaugh2013/><ref name=fahri2013/> The newspaper is currently owned by Nash Holdings LLC, a holding company created for the acquisition and controlled by Bezos.<ref name=fahri2013a /> The sale included ''El Tiempo Latino'' (a Spanish language newspaper), the ''[[Fairfax Times]]'', the ''[[Maryland Gazette]]'', the ''Post Express'' free daily newspaper, Southern Maryland Newspapers, and several newspapers covering and for the U.S. armed forces.<ref name="NashHoldingsincludes">{{cite news | url=http://www.gazette.net/article/20131001/NEWS/131009761/1033/bezos-completes-purchase-of-gazettes-post&template=gazette | first=Kevin James | last=Shay | title=Bezos completes purchase of Gazettes, Post | work=The Maryland Gazette | date=October 1, 2013 | accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref> Nash Holdings also took ownership of the ''Post'' printing plants in [[Springfield, Virginia]]; [[Fairfax County, Virginia]]; and [[Laurel, Maryland]] (the "Comprint plant").<ref name="NashHoldingsincludes" /><ref name=Form8K /> Other assets included in the sale were the publications ''Apartment Showcase'', ''Capital Business'', ''Fashion Washington'', ''Guide to Retirement Living Sourcebook'', ''New Condominium Guide'', and ''New Homes Guide''; the internet sites TheCapitolDeal.com and ServiceAlley.com; and Comprint Military Publications (which included eight weekly newspapers covering local military bases, 10 annual guides to local military bases, and the Web sites DCMilitary.com, DCMilitaryEd.com, DCMilitaryFamLife.com).<ref name=Form8K>{{cite web | url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104889/000095015713000294/ex2-1.htm | title=Form 8-K.

Not included in the sale were other Washington Post Company assets, including the Washington Post Company's downtown office building, the Post's Robinson Terminal facilities in Alexandria, Virginia; Post-Newsweek Stations; Cable ONE (a [[Phoenix, Arizona]]-based Internet and cable service provider); independent web-based media assets such as Slate Group (''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine and its sister video magazine, Slate V), ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'', and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]''; social media marketing company Social Code; home healthcare and hospice provider Celtic Healthcare; and the energy parts supplier Forney Corporation.<ref name="Irwin"/><ref name=RenamedGraham /> After the completion of the sale, a press release announced the name change of the Washington Post Company to Graham Holdings Company (the change was made effective on November 29, 2013).<ref name="Irwin"/><ref name=RenamedGraham>{{cite news|title=Washington Post Co. renamed Graham Holdings Company to mark sale of newspaper|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/washington-post-co-renamed-graham-holdings-company-to-mark-sale-of-newspaper/2013/11/18/57fbc7fe-5060-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=November 18, 2013|author=Debbi Wilgoren}}</ref>

In early September 2013, Bezos summarized his approach for the news organization—with a vision that recreates "the 'daily ritual' of reading ''The Post'' as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories"—although he indicated that the experience was more likely to be created on [[tablet computer]]s and less likely "on the Web".<ref name=wp20130904>{{cite news |last=Farhi |first=Paul |first2=Craig |last2=Timberg |title=Jeff Bezos to His Future Washington Post Journalists: Put the Readers First |url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-04/lifestyle/41765347_1_jeff-bezos-tablet-computers-readers |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 28, 2013 }}</ref>

In August 2014, ''The Washington Post'' launched "Get There" - an online personal finance section.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barr|first1=Jeremy|title=Washington Post launches personal finance section|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/08/8551341/emwashington-postem-launches-personal-finance-section|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>

==Political stance==
In the mid-1970s, conservatives called the newspaper "[[Pravda]] on the Potomac" because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials.<ref>[[Bruce Bartlett|Bartlett, Bruce]] (March 13, 2007). [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/13/20070313-090315-7881r/ "Partisan Press Parity?"]. ''[[The Washington Times]]''.</ref> Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.<ref>[[James Kirchick|Kirchick, James]] (February 18, 2009).  [http://www.tnr.com/article/pravda-the-potomac "Pravda on the Potomac"]. ''[[The New Republic]]''.</ref><ref>[[William Greider]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/washington-post-warriors "Washington Post Warriors"], ''[[The Nation]]'', March 6, 2003.</ref> In 1963, FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] reportedly told President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], "I don't have much influence with ''The Post'' because I frankly don't read it. I view it like the ''[[Daily Worker]]''."<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Michael Beschloss |first=Michael |last=Beschloss |title=Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963–1964 |page=32 |location=New York |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-684-80407-7 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Taylor Branch |first=Taylor |last=Branch |title=Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963–1965 |page=180 |location=New York |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-684-84809-0 }}</ref>

As Katharine Graham noted in her autobiography ''[[Personal History]]'', the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Robert Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/25/AR2006102501668.html |title=Wrong Choice for Governor |work=The Washington Post |date= October 26, 2006|accessdate= April 4, 2009}}</ref> In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in [[Northern Virginia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/29/AR2006102900552.html |title=For Congress in Virginia |work=The Washington Post |date= October 30, 2006|accessdate= April 4, 2009}}</ref> There have also been times when ''The Post'' has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, such as in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]] when it refused to endorse then-Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] or then-Vice President [[George H.W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite news

In "Buying the War" on PBS, Bill Moyers noted 27 editorials supporting [[George W. Bush]]'s ambitions to invade Iraq. National security correspondent [[Walter Pincus]] reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Republican administrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/transcript1.html |title=Transcript: "Buying the War"|work=PBS |date= April 25, 2007 |accessdate= December 13, 2009}}</ref>

In 1992, the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] investigative news program ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' suggested that ''The Post'' had moved to the right in response to its smaller, more conservative rival ''[[The Washington Times]]'', which is owned by [[News World Communications]], an international media conglomerate owned by the [[Unification Church]], which also owns newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America. The program quoted [[Paul Weyrich]], one of the founders of the conservative activist organization the [[Moral Majority]], as saying "''The Washington Post'' became very arrogant and they just decided that they would determine what was news and what wasn't news and they wouldn't cover a lot of things that went on. And ''The Washington Times'' has forced ''The Post'' to cover a lot of things that they wouldn't cover if the ''Times'' wasn't in existence."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 2008, Thomas F. Roeser of the ''Chicago Daily Observer'' also mentioned competition from ''The Washington Times'' as a factor moving ''The Post'' to the right.<ref>Roeser, Thomas F. (August 18, 2008). [http://cdobs.com/archive/our-columns/how-the-liberal-media-stonewalled-the-edwards-story "How the Liberal Media Stonewalled the Edwards"]. ''Chicago Daily Observer''.</ref>

On March 26, 2007, [[Chris Matthews]] said on his television program, "Well, ''The Washington Post'' is not the liberal newspaper it was, Congressman, let me tell you. I have been reading it for years and it is a [[neoconservatism|neocon]] newspaper".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17798805 |title=Hardball with Chris Matthews for March 23 | publisher = [[MSNBC]] |date= March 26, 2007 |accessdate= April 4, 2009}}</ref> It has regularly published an ideological mixture of op-ed columnists, some of them left-leaning (including [[E.J. Dionne]], [[Greg Sargent]], and [[Eugene Robinson (journalist)|Eugene Robinson]]), and many on the right (including [[George Will]], [[Marc Thiessen]], [[Robert Kagan]], [[Robert Samuelson]], [[Michael Gerson]] and [[Charles Krauthammer]]).

In November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2007/112907.html |title=WPost Buys into Anti-Obama Bigotry |author=Robert Parry |authorlink=Robert Parry (journalist) |work=Consortium News |date= November 29, 2007 |accessdate= April 4, 2009}}</ref> In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President [[Al Gore]] and President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>[http://www.consortiumnews.com/2009/031909.html "Framing Obama&nbsp;– by the WPost"]. [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]]. Consortium News. March 19, 2009</ref>

Responding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], former ''Post'' [[ombudsman]] [[Deborah Howell]] wrote: "The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama."<ref>{{cite news | author = Howell, Deborah | authorlink = Deborah Howell | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/14/AR2008111403057.html | title = Remedying the Bias Perception | work = The Washington Post | date = November 16, 2008}}</ref> According to a 2009 publication, in the blogging community, liberal bloggers link to ''The Washington Post'' and ''The New York Times'' more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Davis|title=Typing Politics: The Role of Blogs in American Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PWZ2-5wla3MC&pg=PA79|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|page=79}}</ref>

In January 2014, it was announced that [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] columnist [[Ezra Klein]] was going to leave the newspaper together with [[Dylan Matthews]] and another journalist to establish the new news site ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Tom McCarthy | url = http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/21/washington-posts-ezra-klein-leaving-news-organisation | title = Washington Post's Ezra Klein leaving newspaper to start 'new venture' | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = January 21, 2014}}</ref> Also in January 2014, ''The Washington Post'' announced a partnership with the [[Libertarian conservatism|conservative-libertarian]] blog ''[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]'' and started hosting the blog on its website.<ref>{{cite news | author = Sarah Mui | url = http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/around_the_blawgosphere_volokh_dynamic_pricing_ponzi_schemes_snow_on_cars?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tech_monthly | title = Volokh Conspiracy blog now subject to Washington Post's paywall &#124; Can lawyers use dynamic pricing? | work = [[ABA Journal]] | date = January 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Justin Berrier | url = http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/01/22/the-volokh-conspiracy-and-washington-posts-move/197694 | title = The Volokh Conspiracy And Washington Post's Move To The Right | work = [[Media Matters for America]] | date = January 22, 2014}}</ref>
