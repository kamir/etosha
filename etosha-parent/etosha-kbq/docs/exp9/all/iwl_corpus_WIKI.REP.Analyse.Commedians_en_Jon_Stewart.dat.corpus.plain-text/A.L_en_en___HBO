'''HBO (Home Box Office)''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Pay television|premium]] [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[television network|network]] that is owned by Home Box Office Inc., an [[operating subsidiary]] of [[Time Warner]]. HBO's programming consists primarily of theatrically released [[feature film|motion pictures]] and original [[television series]], along with [[television film|made-for-cable movies]] and [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[Boxing|boxing matches]] and occasional [[stand-up comedy]] and [[concert]] [[television special|specials]]. It is the oldest and longest continuously operating pay television service (basic or premium) in the United States, having been in operation since November 8, 1972.

==Overview==
As of February 2015, HBO's programming is available to approximately 35,817,000 households with at least one television set (30.8% of all cable, satellite and telco customers) in the United States (35,451,000 subscribers or 30.5% of all households with pay television service receive at least HBO's primary channel),<ref name="Cable Subs">{{cite web|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|author=Robert Seidman|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Zap2It]] ([[Tribune Media]])|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> making it the second largest premium channel in the United States ([[Encore (TV channel)|Encore]]'s programming reaches 38.31 million pay television households {{as of|2015|2|lc=on}}<ref name="Cable Subs"/><ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Company Overview|url=http://starz.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18|publisher=[[Starz Inc.]]|date=December 31, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref>). In addition to its U.S. subscriber base, HBO also broadcasts in at least 151 countries, covering approximately 114 million subscribers worldwide.<ref name=timewarner>{{cite web|title=HBO: Home Box Office|url=http://www.timewarner.com/our-content/home-box-office/|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

HBO subscribers generally pay for an extra tier of service that includes other cable- and satellite-exclusive channels even before paying for the channel itself (though HBO often prices all of its channels together in a single package). However, a law imposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires that cable providers allow a person to get just "limited" basic cable (which includes local, and in some areas, out-of-market [[terrestrial television|broadcast stations]] and [[public, educational, and government access]] channels) and premium services such as HBO, without subscribing to expanded service ([[Comcast]] is the only major provider to have purposefully offered the network in such a manner utilizing this law, as it offered a [[Product bundling|bundled]] cable/Internet package that included limited basic service and HBO from October 2013 to July 2014, or January of the latter year in some markets).<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC Consumer Facts|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cablechannels.html|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Subscribers Need Not Order Expanded Packages to Get Premium Channels|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-94845278.html|agency=[[Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 1, 2002|accessdate=February 23, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Comcast Offers HBO Without Other Cable Channels in Bundle Aimed at Cord-Cutters and Cord-Nevers|url=http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/comcast-becomes-first-pay-tv-distributor-to-offer-hbo-without-basic-cable-1200761863/|author=Todd Spangler|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> Cable providers can require the use of a converter box – usually digital – in order to receive HBO.

HBO also provides its content through digital media, maintaining [[HBO Go]], a [[video on demand]] streaming service available as a website and slate of [[mobile app]]s exclusively to existing subscribers of the linear channel suite; a separate, but similar standalone service, [[HBO Now]], will launch in April 2015 as a subscription streaming platform that does not require a subscription to the HBO television service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Doesn't HBO Allow Non-Cable Subscribers To Subscribe To HBO Go à la Hulu?|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/09/05/why-doesnt-hbo-allow-non-cable-subscribers-to-subscribe-to-hbo-go-a-la-hulu/|author=Jonathan Sherman-Presser|work=[[Forbes]]|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name=gigaom-hbonow>{{cite web|title=HBO officially announces April launch of HBO Now at Apple event|url=https://gigaom.com/2015/03/09/hbo-officially-announces-launch-of-hbo-now-at-apple-event/|author=Janko Roettgers|website=[[Gigaom]]|author=GigaOmniMedia, Inc.|date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

Many HBO programs have been [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to other networks and broadcast [[television station]]s (usually after some editing), and a number of HBO-produced series and films have been released on [[DVD]]. Since HBO's more successful series (most notably shows such as ''[[Sex and the City]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and ''[[True Blood]]'') air on over-the-air broadcasters in other countries (such as in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and much of [[Europe]] – including the [[United Kingdom]]), HBO's programming has the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population of those countries compared to the United States. Because of the cost of HBO (which is the most expensive of the U.S. premium services, costing a monthly fee {{as of|2015|lc=y}} between $15 and $20 depending on the provider), many Americans only view HBO programs through DVDs or in basic cable or broadcast syndication – months or even years after these programs have first aired on the network – and with editing for both content and to allow advertising, although several series have filmed alternate "clean" scenes intended for syndication runs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable show producers shoot tamer versions.

==History==

===Development and launch===
In 1965, [[Charles Dolan]], who had already done pioneering work in the commercial use of cables and had developed a [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] [[tourist information]] television system distributed to hotels in the [[New York metropolitan area]] called Teleguide, won a franchise to build a [[cable television]] system in the [[Lower Manhattan]] section of [[New York City]].<ref name="Sterling Cable">{{cite web|title=1970s: Coming of Age – Sterling Manhattan Cable|url=http://m.history.timewarnercable.com/the-twc-story/era-1970s/Story.aspx?story=44|work=[[Time Warner Cable]]|date=February 18, 2013}}</ref> The new system, which Dolan named "Sterling Information Services" (later to be known as Sterling Manhattan Cable, and eventually becoming [[Time Warner Cable]]), became the first urban underground cable television system in the United States. Rather than stringing cable on telephone poles or using [[microwave]] antennas to receive the signals, Sterling laid underground cable beneath the streets of Manhattan – because the multitude of tall buildings in the city blocked television signals (besides that issue, the New York City Council had also required all electrical and telecommunication wires be laid underground to limit service disruptions during inclement weather conditions, resulting from a [[blizzard]] in the early 20th century that caused damage to telephone and [[telegraph]] lines in the area).<ref name="Green Channel">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Green Channel|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-green-channel/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=August 11, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref> That same year, [[Time Life|Time-Life, Inc.]] purchased 20% of Dolan's company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Dolan profile page|url=http://www.forbes.com/profile/charles-dolan|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cablevision: Charles Dolan|url=http://www.cablevision.com/about/leadership/charles_dolan.jsp|work=[[Cablevision]]|date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

Sterling Manhattan consistently lost revenue during its first six years due to the expense of running cable underground and into buildings throughout Manhattan (a cost that amounted as much as $300,000 per mile) and a limited subscriber base, with only 400 subscribers [[Borough (New York City)|borough]]-wide by 1971. In the summer of 1971, while on a family vacation in [[France]], Charles Dolan began to think of ideas to make Sterling Manhattan profitable. He came up with the concept for a cable-originated television service called "'''The Green Channel'''". Dolan later presented his idea to Time-Life management; though [[communications satellite|satellite]] distribution seemed only a distant possibility at the time, he persuaded Time-Life to back him.<ref name="Green Channel"/>

To gauge whether consumers would be interested in subscribing to a pay television service, Time-Life sent out a [[direct mail]] research brochure to residents in six U.S. cities. An overwhelming majority of those surveyed (approximately 99%) opposed the idea; 4% of those polled in a second survey conducted through an independent consultant said they were "almost certain" to subscribe to such a service. Time-Life later conducted a test in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]] in which salesmen presented the concept of a pay channel to residents by offering free service for the first month and a refundable installation fee; one out of every two residents surveyed in the test expressed interest in purchasing the conceptual service.<ref name="Green Channel"/> In a meeting involving Dolan and some Time-Life executives that were working on the project, other names were discussed for the new service. They ultimately settled on calling it "'''Home Box Office'''", although the name was originally intended as a [[working title]] in order to meet deadlines to publish research brochures for the new service, believing that management would come up with a different name at a later date.<ref name="Green Channel"/>

Originally, Home Box Office was to debut on a [[Service Electric]] cable television system in Allentown; in order to avoid [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackouts]] for [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] games that it was set to televise (Allentown was within the NBA's designated blackout radius for the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' market area, under rules that were in effect at the time to protect ticket sales), Time-Life agreed to an offer by Service Electric president [[John Walson]] to launch the channel on its system in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] (outside of the 76ers' DMA, in [[northeastern Pennsylvania]]).<ref name="Green Channel"/> Home Box Office launched on the evening of November 8, 1972.<!--- Please specify the actual time of day on the aforementioned date when HBO officially launched, if searchable (preferably, with some form of ref). ---> However, HBO's launch came with no fanfare in the press, as it was not covered by any local or national media outlets. In addition, the city manager of Wilkes-Barre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony, while Time Inc. president and [[chief executive officer]] J. Richard Munro was unable to attend as he was stranded in traffic on the [[George Washington Bridge]] on his way to Wilkes-Barre.<ref name="Satellite">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Skies, Junior Birdmen!|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-skies-junior-birdmen/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=August 17, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

The first program and film broadcast on the channel, the 1971 movie ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (film)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]] and [[Henry Fonda]], was transmitted that evening to 325 Service Electric subscribers in Wilkes-Barre (a plaque commemorating this event is located at Public Square in downtown Wilkes-Barre). Home Box Office broadcast its first sports event immediately after the film: an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey game between the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[Vancouver Canucks]] from [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Risk: A Game of Cable Domination|url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/HBO.html|author=Kimberly C.

Sterling Manhattan Cable continued to lose money because the company had only a small subscriber base of 20,000 customers in Manhattan. Dolan's media partner, Time-Life, Inc., gained control of Sterling when it acquired an additional 60% interest in the company, increasing its interest to 80%; Time-Life then decided to pull the plug on the Sterling Manhattan operation. Time-Life dropped the "Sterling" name and the company became "Manhattan Cable Television" under Time-Life's control in March 1973.<ref name="Sterling Cable"/> [[Gerald M. Levin|Gerald Levin]], who had been with Home Box Office since it began operations as its [[vice president]] of programming, replaced Dolan as the company's president and chief executive officer.<ref name="HBO 70s">{{cite web|title=1970s: Coming of Age – HBO & Satellites|url=http://m.history.timewarnercable.com/the-twc-story/era-1970s/Story.aspx?story=45|work=Time Warner Cable|date=February 18, 2013}}</ref> In September 1973, Time-Life, Inc. completed its acquisition of the pay service. At the time, Home Box Office's future looked dim: it only had 8,000 subscribers across 14 cable systems, all of which were located in Pennsylvania,<ref name="Satellite"/> and it was suffering from a significant subscriber [[churn rate]]. HBO would eventually increase its fortunes within two years: by April 1975, the service had around 100,000 subscribers in Pennsylvania and New York state, and had begun to turn a limited profit.<ref name="Satellite"/>

===National expansion, innovation and rise to prominence (1975–1993)===
[[File:Satcom, Communication Satellite - GPN-2003-00010.jpg|thumb|upright|The RCA Satcom domestic communication satellite launched on December 13, 1975, spurred the [[cable television]] industry to unprecedented heights – with the assistance of HBO.]]
Time-Life executives realized the problems in trying to expand Home Box Office's distribution footprint using microwave towers because of the time and expense that would be incurred in developing such a vast relay infrastructure, and began looking for cost-efficient methods of transmitting the channel nationally. In 1974, they settled on using a geostationary [[communications satellite]] to transmit HBO to cable providers throughout the United States. Other television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about uplinking to satellite due to fears that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or go out of orbit, as well as due to the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes, which in 1974, were sold for as much as $75,000. Seeing satellite transmission as the only viable option, Gerald Levin allocated $6.5 million to lease [[transponder]] space on the [[Westar 1]] satellite for a five-year term.<ref name="Satellite"/> The Time-Life board subsequently approved the plan to transmit HBO via satellite.<ref name="HBO 70s"/>

At 9:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television network to continuously deliver its signal via satellite when it broadcast the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" [[boxing]] match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]]; it was beamed to cable providers in [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]] and [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], [[Florida]], and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of the Cable-Satellite Distribution System|url=http://comm.louisville.edu/~al/421/pdfs/parsons.pdf|author=Patrick Parsons|journal=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|publisher=Broadcast Education Association|volume=47|issue=1|pages=1–17|date=2003|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}</ref> as well as those already carrying HBO in the [[northeastern United States]].<ref name="Satellite"/><ref name="Forsyth 2002" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Communications History - Home Box Office|url=http://www.fcc.gov/omd/history/tv/1960-1989.html|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> Through the use of satellite, the channel began transmitting separate programming feeds for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s, allowing the same programs that air first in the eastern half of the United States to air at accordant times in the western part of the country.<ref name="ExpandingtheBrand2">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: Expanding The Brand (Part 2)|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-expanding-the-brand-part-2/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=November 18, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref> HBO switched its domestic satellite transmissions from Westar 1 to [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom 1]] in February 1976. By 1977, [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Atlanta]] [[superstation]] [[WPCH-TV|WTCG-TV]] (soon to become [[TBS (TV channel)|WTBS]]) and [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN Satellite Service]] (later to become the present-day [[ABC Family]]) had joined it, pioneering satellite delivery for the cable television industry.<ref name="Forsyth 2002"/><ref>{{cite web|title=United States: Cable Television|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/U/htmlU/unitedstatesc/unitedstatesc.htm|work=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}</ref> By 1980, HBO was carried on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states.<ref name="Satellite"/>

HBO broadcast its programming for only nine hours each day, from 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, during its first nine years of operation. The network first began to operate a 24-hour schedule on weekends in September 1981, running from 3:00&nbsp;p.m. on Friday afternoons until 12:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday nights/early Monday mornings; this round-the-clock schedule was expanded to weekdays three months later on December 28, 1981 (however, HBO was not the first pay television network to maintain an uninterrupted programming schedule as [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[The Movie Channel]] had both switched to 24-hour daily schedule months earlier). By this time, the full "Home Box Office" name was de-emphasized by the network, in favor of branding solely by the "HBO" acronym (although the full name is still used in copyright tags featured in the [[closing credits]] of its original programs and a [[disclaimer|legal disclaimer]] slide seen daily on its primary and multiplex channels).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1983, HBO premiered its first original movie, ''[[The Terry Fox Story]]'', a [[biopic]] that was also the first movie ever produced for pay television. That year also saw the premiere of the first children's program broadcast on the channel: ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' (that series' creator, [[Jim Henson]], had earlier produced the special ''Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas'', which won an [[CableACE Awards|ACE Award]] in 1978<ref name="An Original Voice"/>). HBO continued to air various original programs aimed at children until 2001, when these programs almost completely moved over to HBO Family.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Fraggle Rock|url=http://www.henson.com/family_fragglerock.php?content=about|publisher=[[The Jim Henson Company]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

HBO became involved in several [[lawsuit]]s during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that would have resulted in some programs on HBO and other pay television networks being [[censorship|censored]] by cable systems. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television network to [[Television encryption|encrypt]] its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the [[Videocipher]] II system; this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from [[television receive-only]] (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming without a subscription.<ref name="ExpandingtheBrand2"/> The objections by TVRO users over having to now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal) came to a head four months later, as HBO became a victim of [[broadcast signal intrusion]] when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling himself "[[Captain Midnight (HBO)|Captain Midnight]]", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's transponder on Satcom 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman]]''; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the film with a message placed over [[SMPTE color bars]] in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] subsequently prosecuted MacDougall.

In 1988, HBO's subscriber base expanded greatly as a result of the [[Writers Guild of America]] [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|strike]] that year. HBO had new programming in its inventory, while the broadcast networks were only able to air [[rerun]]s of their shows. In 1989, HBO [[comparative advertising|compared]] its programming against rival pay television network Showtime, with the slogan "Simply the Best", using the [[Tina Turner]] single "[[The Best (song)|The Best]]" as part of the network's on-air image campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Online Television Museum: HBO|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/International/usa/hbo.html|publisher=[[TVARK]]|date=December 13, 1975|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

On January 2, 1989, HBO launched Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax ("''Spanish Selections from HBO and Cinemax''") – an alternate Spanish-language feed of HBO and Cinemax.

===Rising prominence of original programming (1993–present)===
During the 1990s, HBO began to experience increasing success with its original series such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'', ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]'', ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'' and ''[[Arliss]]''. One such program, ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', arguably became HBO's flagship series during that decade and although it was not commercially as successful as programs that aired on the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three networks]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] and [[CBS]]) and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the show did enjoy a cult status and critical acclaim, and received nominations and wins for many major television awards (including [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]]).<ref name="imdbawards">{{cite web|title=Awards for "The Larry Sanders Show"|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103466/awards|work=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}</ref> The series ranked #38 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]] (becoming the only HBO comedy series to make the list)<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|work=[[CBS News]]|date=April 26, 2002|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref> and was also included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s list of the "100 Best TV Shows of All Time".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/completelist/0,,1651341,00.html|author=[[James Poniewozik]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 6, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}</ref> ''The Larry Sanders Show'' was also ranked by various critics and fans as one of the best TV comedies of the 1990s.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|title=AT WORK WITH Garry Shandling; Late-Night TV, Ever More Unreal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/10/garden/at-work-with-garry-shandling-late-night-tv-ever-more-unreal.html|author=Bernard Weinraub|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=December 10, 1992|accessdate=December 4, 2010|quote=The reaction to "Larry Sanders", perhaps the most widely acclaimed new comedy on television, has stunned him.}}</ref>

The original programs that HBO has developed since the early 1990s have earned the channel numerous nominations for and wins of Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emmy Award Database|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}} {{Failed verification|date=December 2013}}</ref> One aspect as to the perceived higher quality of these shows is due to both the quality of the writing on the programs and the fact that as a subscription-only service, HBO does not carry "normal" commercials; instead the network runs [[promo (media)|promotions]] for upcoming HBO programs and behind-the-scenes featurettes between programs. This relieves HBO from some pressures to tone down controversial aspects of its programs, and allows for more explicit content to be incorporated into its shows that would not be allowed to air on broadcast television or basic cable, such as graphic [[violence]], sexual situations and [[profanity]].

Beginning with the 1997 launch of its first one-hour dramatic narrative series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', HBO started a trend that became commonplace with premium cable services. Although critically acclaimed, it was not until ''[[The Sopranos]]'' premiered in 1999, that the network achieved both mass critical and Emmy success. ''The Sopranos'' received 111 Emmy nominations during its six-season run, resulting in 21 wins, two of them for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]]. 1998 saw the debut of the 12-part [[miniseries]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', which was produced by [[Tom Hanks]], [[Ron Howard]] and [[Brian Grazer]] and based on the [[Andrew Chaikin]] book ''[[A Man on the Moon]]''; costing $68 million to produce, it traced the U.S. space program from the U.S./U.S.S.R. space race through the final moon landing, [[Apollo 17]]. ''From the Earth to the Moon'' won an Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Miniseries]], and helped spur other HBO miniseries based on historical events such as ''[[61*]]'', ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', ''[[John Adams (miniseries)|John Adams]]'' and ''[[The Pacific (TV miniseries)|The Pacific]]''. That year also saw the debut of the comedy series ''[[Sex and the City]]'', which was based the book series of the same name by [[Candace Bushnell]]; over the course of its six-season run, the show centered on the friendship and romances of four New York City women.<ref name="HBOGoldenAge3">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: Golden Age: Part 3|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-golden-age-part-3/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>

In 2002, HBO debuted ''[[The Wire]]'', which, although not surpassing ''The Sopranos'' in viewership success, did however match its critical acclaim over its five-season run{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and further cemented HBO's reputation as being a network that produced quality programming. HBO experienced another success among viewers in 2008, with the debut of ''[[True Blood]]'', a [[vampire]] drama based on a series of gothic novels by [[Charlaine Harris]]. The network saw three more hit series in the 2010s with ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', based on [[George R. R. Martin]]'s fantasy novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', which earned both critical and viewer praise; ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', a comedy series created by series star [[Lena Dunham]]; and ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'', an [[anthology series|anthology]]-style series – structured to feature a different cast and setting within each season's storyline – which initially saw established film actors [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Matthew McConaughey]] in its lead roles.<ref name="Fall and Rise">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: Fall and Rise|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-fall-and-rise/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium services to offer [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]] services to cable customers as companions to the main network, offering additional channels of HBO and Cinemax to three systems operated by TeleCable in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], [[Racine, Wisconsin]] and the [[Dallas]] suburbs of [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] and [[Plano, Texas]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business; HBO Planning to Add New Movie Channels|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/business/the-media-business-hbo-planning-to-add-new-movie-channels.html?pagewanted=all|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 9, 1991|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> The first two multiplex channels – HBO2 and HBO3 – launched as part of this test by the TeleCable systems.

The HBO multiplex would later expand with the launch of HBO Family in December 1996, focusing on family-oriented [[feature film]]s and television series aimed at younger children.<ref name="HBO Family"/> The HBO multiplex channels became collectively marketed under the brand name "HBO The Works" in April 1998 (the Cinemax channels concurrently began to be marketed as "MultiMax"), coinciding with the name change of HBO2 as HBO Plus (the channel would ultimately restore the HBO2 name in 2002), and the [[rebranding]] and format change of HBO3 as HBO Signature (a network aimed at women). In May 1999, two more channels launched: HBO Comedy (featuring comedic films and series, along with [[stand-up comedy]] specials) and HBO Zone (a network aimed at young adults).<ref name="HBO digital networks">{{cite web|title=HBO sets new digital networks: five channels will be added to existing multiplex channels to create a package of 10|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20511093.html|author=John M. Higgins|work=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 13, 1998|accessdate=March 13, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref> Just over a year later in October 2000, HBO Latino debuted as a [[Spanish language]] channel featuring a mix of dubbed simulcasts of the main HBO channel's programming and Spanish programs that are exclusive to the channel.

"HBO The Works" continued in use as the brand for the HBO multiplex until 2004. Individually, the HBO multiplex has no "official" marketed name {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, although HBO and Cinemax's respective multiplex packages are marketed collectively as the "HBO/MAX Pak".<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO: Digital to the Max|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72291713.html|author=Karen Anderson Prikios|work=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=March 19, 2001|accessdate=February 25, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref> HBO Family and HBO Latino have the distinction of being the only multiplex channels of HBO that have their own websites; all of the others are integrated within the main HBO site.

===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, HBO provides up to thirteen multiplex channels – seven 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in both [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]] – as well as a [[video on demand|subscription video-on-demand]] service (HBO On Demand).

HBO broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main HBO channel, as well as HBO2 in some cases), resulting in the [[Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting|difference in local airtimes]] for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most. The premium film service Cinemax, which is also owned by Time Warner through Home Box Office Inc., operates as a separate service from HBO; although HBO is very frequently sold together in a package with Cinemax, subscribers to one of the services do not necessarily have to subscribe to the other.

The channel also typically debuts new movies on a weekly basis – with feature films debuting on HBO within a lag of between eight months to one year on average from their initial theatrical release – on Saturday nights (usually around 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; the Pacific Time Zone broadcast of the premiered film airs later in the evening when a live special – most commonly, a telecast of ''[[HBO World Championship Boxing]]'' or ''[[HBO Boxing After Dark]]'' – is scheduled to air that particular Saturday, with the special being shown after the movie on the Eastern Time Zone feed). The main HBO channel mainly airs R-rated films only after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific, but does air certain TV-MA rated programs during the daytime hours.

Launched in 1991, the channel was renamed '''HBO Plus''' in April 1998, but reverted to the original "HBO2" name in September 2002. In [[Latin America]], a local version of HBO2 rebroadcasts movies previously aired on the main [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO Latin America]] channel, and HBO Plus functions as a separate channel.

HBO Family is HBO's third (and only successful) venture at a family-oriented pay service: two similarly formatted standalone mini-pay services that were launched by the network, Take 2 in 1979 and Festival in 1987, both ceased operations after short existences. Despite being a premium service, cable providers have occasionally used HBO Family to temporarily replace television stations that were dropped due to [[carriage dispute]]s with providers such as during [[Hearst Television]]'s 2012 dispute with Time Warner Cable that resulted in TWC's associated [[Bright House Networks]] system substituting independent station [[WMOR-TV]] with the channel in [[Tampa, Florida]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Hearst dispute with Bright House pulls WMOR-Ch. 32 and digital THIS TV off Tampa Bay cable system|url=http://networkedblogs.com/zJMOu|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> and a dispute between [[Cox Communications]] and [[LIN Media|LIN TV]] in which HBO Family temporarily replaced Fox affiliate [[WVBT]] from Cox's [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]] system from January to February 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox 43 is Back...On Cox 43; Daylong Arbitration Brings WVBT Back to Former TV Channel Position|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63238359.html|author=Michael Clark|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot|via=HighBeam Research|date=February 5, 2000|accessdate=February 25, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=September 2012}}</ref>

The channel's programming includes HBO original productions, Spanish and Portuguese series from HBO Latin America, dubbed versions of Hollywood blockbusters, Spanish-language films and boxing events (including the original boxing series ''Boxeo De Oro'').

====Cinemax====
{{main|Cinemax}}
On August 1, 1980, HBO launched Cinemax, a companion movie-based premium channel<ref>{{cite news|title=2nd Cable Movie Service From Home Box Office|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B1EFD385F12728DDDA80B94DF405B8084F1D3|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 31, 1980|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref> created as HBO's answer to fellow movie-oriented pay service The Movie Channel (which operated as a standalone service at the time). Unlike HBO, Cinemax maintained a 24-hour schedule from its launch. The channel succeeded early on partly due to its reliance on movie classics from the 1950s to the 1970s – with some more recent films mixed in – that would be presented uncut and without commercial interruption, at a time when cable subscribers only received about three dozen channels due to limited [[cable television headend|headend]] channel capacity. In most cases, cable operators sold Cinemax and HBO as a single package, usually offered at a discount for customers that chose to subscribe to both channels.

In its early years, Cinemax carried music specials and some limited original programming such as ''[[Second City Television]]'' and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'' in addition to movies, but the network subsequently become known among its subscribers for airing [[softcore pornography|softcore adult films and series]] during the late night hours that contain [[sexual intercourse|strong sexual content]] and [[nudity]] (broadcasts of such programs are restricted from airing on the main Cinemax channel before 11:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time),<ref name="Cinemax makeover">{{cite web|title=Little brother Cinemax gets extensive makeover|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|author=Rod Granger|work=Multichannel News|via=HighBeam Research|date=November 2, 1992}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Skinemax">{{cite web|title=HBO's stealth plan to kill off 'Skinemax'|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/guns_poses_05H3v5lnOgLrvPyjcJWoGL|author=Michael Shain|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=February 14, 2011}}</ref> and eventually began producing original action series in August 2011.<ref name="Skinemax"/> Beginning with the launch of Cinemax 2 (now MoreMax) in 1991, Cinemax has gradually launched its own set of multiplex services; {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, in addition to its main feed and MoreMax, Cinemax operates five additional channels: ActionMax (which originally launched as Cinemax 3 in 1995); ThrillerMax (which launched in 1998);<ref name="HBO digital networks"/> MovieMax (which originally launched as WMax in 2001); Max Latino (which originally launched as @Max in 2001) and 5StarMax (which originally launched in 2001).<ref name="Four Plexes">{{cite web|title=Cinemax Branches Out with Four Plexes|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69279493.html|author=Linda Moss|work=Multichannel News|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 15, 2001|accessdate=March 13, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=Rebrand Advisory|url=http://www.homeboxoffice.com/to/Recently_Updated/Rebrand_Advisory.pdf|work=Home Box Office Inc.|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cinemax changing @MAX to Spanish-language MAX Latino|url=http://hd-report.com/2013/05/24/cinemax-changing-max-to-spanish-language-max-latino/|work=HD Report|date=May 24, 2013}}</ref>

===Other services===

====HBO HD====
HBO HD is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of HBO that broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format. In addition to its main channel, HBO also operates high definition simulcast feeds of its six multiplex channels. HBO HD is available on several major cable providers including Cox Communications; [[DirecTV]]; [[Charter Communications]]; Time Warner Cable; [[Dish Network]]; [[Comcast]]; [[AT&T U-verse]]; [[Optimum]]; and [[Verizon FiOS]], although few providers offer all seven multiplex channels in HD. The main channel first began broadcasting in high definition on March 6, 1999.<ref name="HBO HD"/>

====HBO on Demand====
HBO on Demand is the channel's [[video on demand|subscription video-on-demand]] service; launched on July 1, 2001 on Time Warner Cable's Columbia, South Carolina system, it was the first subscription VOD service offered by a premium channel in the United States.<ref name="HBO On Demand"/> HBO on Demand offers a selection of movies, original series and specials previously seen on the network.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=[[Amanda D. Lotz]]|publisher=New York University Press|location=[[New York City]], [[New York]]|page=132|year=2007}}</ref> The service is provided at no additional cost to HBO subscribers, who already regularly pay a premium fee to cable and satellite providers to receive access to the channel. HBO launched the VOD service in an effort to allow subscribers access to the channel's programming on their own schedules, thereby reducing the frequency in which viewers were unable to find a program they would like to watch as well as limiting cancellations to the service for that same reason. HBO on Demand features a rotating selection of films, specials and series, with select new titles added each Friday alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.

The standard definition and high definition versions of the HBO on Demand service are available on most cable and satellite providers, delivered to customers who subscribe to the linear HBO channels at no additional charge. On January 3, 2011, HBO became the first premium channel and the first cable network to offer a [[3DTV|3D]]-only VOD service as it launched a subscription video on demand service offering select feature films in 3D to Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Verizon FiOS customers who subscribe to the HBO service.<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO Pops Cork On 3D Video-On-Demand|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/hbo-pops-cork-3d-video-demand/328081|author=Todd Spangler|work=Multichannel News|date=January 3, 2011}}</ref>

On February 18, 2010, HBO launched HBO Go, a service that carries 1,000 hours of program content available for streaming in standard or high definition, intended as a [[TV Everywhere]] service available only to existing subscribers of the linear HBO television channels (a requirement necessary to access its content via streaming devices such as [[Roku]] and [[Apple TV]], and select [[video game console]]s, as well as via its website and mobile apps). Content available on HBO Go includes theatrically released films as well as HBO original programs, movies, comedy specials, documentaries, sports and late night adult programming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyes-on with HBO GO|url=http://hd.engadget.com/2010/02/17/eyes-on-with-hbo-go/|author=Ben Drawbaugh|work=[[Engadget]]|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Programming==
HBO has long maintained a policy not to run R-rated films on its primary channel between 6:00&nbsp;a.m. and 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time;<ref>{{cite news|title=The Insider; HBO's bleeping little secret; bleeped profanity in an airing of the retrospective "Six Feet Under: 2001–2005: In Memoriam|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-135518278.html|author=Michele Greppi|work=[[TelevisionWeek]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 22, 2005|accessdate=February 25, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Wall |url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-wall/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=September 16, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref> this policy (which may have once stemmed from HBO's availability on analog cable tiers, while its multiplex channels generally required a [[digital cable]] subscription or at least scrambling) remains in place {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, despite the existence of the [[V-chip]] and the fact that other premium services began incorporating R-rated films onto their daytime schedules starting in the mid-1980s. The policy was also applied to all TV-MA rated programs after the [[TV Parental Guidelines]] were implemented on January 1, 1997; however the main HBO channel began airing a limited amount of TV-MA rated original series, movies and documentaries that contain some strong profanity and violence, but are largely devoid of nudity, and graphic violent or sexual content on weekends before 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Schedule: Primary HBO channel|url=http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ScheduleServlet?ACTION_TODAY=TODAY|publisher=Home Box Office Inc.|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> However, HBO does occasionally rebroadcast R-rated films as early as 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time as part of its Sunday rebroadcast of the prior Saturday's movie premiere telecast, depending on the length of the film and the scheduling of any HBO original series that air after it.

Outside of HBO Family, which does not run any programs with either a TV-MA or R rating,<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Family schedule website|url=http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ScheduleServlet?ACTION_TODAY=TODAY|publisher=Home Box Office Inc.|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> HBO's other multiplex channels will air TV-MA and R-rated programming during morning and afternoon time periods. HBO also does not typically allow most NC-17 rated films to be aired on the primary channel or its multiplex channels.

HBO pioneered the [[free preview]] concept – which has since become a standard in the pay television industry – in 1973 as part of a plan to increase subscribership of the channel.<ref>{{cite book|title=It's Not TV: Watching HBO in the Post-Television Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2SUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=HBO+free+preview+Lawrence,+Massachusetts&source=bl&ots=RgDpCLAEn3&sig=qJMEkL6XFCjvYaEUzcMBLWs2fyg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NXA1VZDRMorYtQWI94HgBw&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=HBO%20free%20preview%20Lawrence%2C%20Massachusetts&f=false|author=Marc Leverette|author2=Brian L.

Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers to subscribe to the service. Although participation was voluntary,<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: Title Fights: The King of Pay-TV|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-expanding-the-brand-part-2/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}</ref> preview events are carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number of providers and the providers that choose to offer the event varies depending on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems owned by a [[multiple system operator]] unless at the provider's discretion); HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film).

Since 1992, the channel has produced ''HBO First Look'', a series of documentary-style specials (usually running 15 to 20 minutes in length, with no set schedule) featuring a look behind-the-scenes at the making of an upcoming/recently released film (many of those that are profiled eventually air on HBO once they reach their pay cable release window), with interviews with the actors and principal crew.

===Original programming===
{{Further|List of programs broadcast by HBO}}
Since 1977, HBO has produced original programming, which include dramas and comedies in addition to its slate of theatrical films. Most of these shows are intended for adults (and, with limited exceptions, are typically assigned [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA ratings]]), often featuring high amounts of profanity, violence, sexual themes and/or nudity that would be much more difficult to get on [[Cable television in the United States#Basic cable|basic cable]] or over-the-air broadcast channels, out of fear of losing sponsors. However some of its original programs, primarily those produced before 2001, have also been aimed at families or children; most of these type of programs have migrated to HBO Family, though HBO has produced very few newer family-oriented series for either channel since that point.

The network also produces short segments promoting new films with the cooperation of their filming studios, usually either behind the scenes and interview pieces or red carpet coverage, which are almost exclusively bound for HBO and Cinemax during their paid cable windows; depending on length or content they are either branded as ''HBO News'' for segments under five minutes, or ''HBO First Look'' for those fifteen minutes long. These segments are also often included as bonus features on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the films profiled, but have begun to decline to only a few episodes a year as HBO has focused on high-profile original programming instead and studios have internally produced behind-the-scenes looks at their films for exclusive physical and digital media release.

In addition to maintaining rights to films from various distributors, HBO also produces its own [[television film|made-for-cable movies]] through [[HBO Films]]; the film division, originally named HBO Pictures, began producing original movies for the network in 1983 with the debut of ''The Terry Fox Story''. Unlike most television films produced for cable television, most of the original movies produced by HBO have featured major film actors over the years, ranging from [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]] to [[Michael Douglas]]. The channel also produces stand-up comedy specials, which were formerly broadcast under the ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'', ''HBO Comedy Hour'' and ''HBO Comedy Half-Hour'' banners, which periodically premiere on certain Saturday nights when a boxing match or movie is not scheduled during the late primetime slots.

One of HBO's first successful specials was ''The Bette Midler Show'' in 1976, which launched the ''[[Standing Room Only (TV series)|Standing Room Only]]'' concert series. For a time in the early 1980s, HBO produced a concert special almost every other month, featuring major music stars such as [[Boy George]] and [[The Who]]. After [[MTV]]'s successful rollout in 1981, the ''Standing Room Only'' series began to produce fewer concerts, but focused more on "world class" music events featuring artists such as [[Elton John]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], as well as fundraisers such as [[Farm Aid]].<ref name="An Original Voice"/> The ''On Location'' comedy specials, which presented a stand-up comedian's performance in its entirety and uncut, began in 1975 with a special starring [[Robert Klein]]. The first of twelve concert specials televised by the network featuring [[George Carlin]] aired on HBO in 1977 as part of ''On Location'', featuring Carlin's first televised performance of his classic routine, "[[Seven dirty words|The Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]".<ref name="An Original Voice"/> As other cable channels incorporated comedy specials due to their inexpensive format, HBO began to model its strategy with its comedy specials after its music programming, focusing on a few specials each year featuring popular comedians.<ref name="An Original Voice"/>

HBO CEO Richard Plepler has publicly said he does not want HBO to be like Netflix where users "binge watch" TV shows and movies.  Plepler said, "I don’t think it would have been a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week...I think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period of time.”  Pleper feels that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/hbo-slams-binge-watching_n_7160496.html</ref>

Films that HBO has pay cable rights to will usually also run on Cinemax during its licensing term, although some feature films from the aforementioned studios that the two channels have broadcast rights to will make their premium television debut on HBO several weeks before its premiere on Cinemax and vice versa.

====Former first-run contracts====
During the early years of premium cable, it was not uncommon for multiple pay television services, including HBO, Showtime and The Movie Channel (and later, Cinemax), to hold broadcast rights to the same feature films. HBO began purchasing exclusive rights to broadcast select individual films in the late 1970s; these gradually expanded to exclusive output deals (which are commonplace with [[North America]]n premium channels to this day), in which a pay service enters into a licensing agreement to broadcast movies from a particular film studio over a period of years. HBO signed its first major exclusive film output deal with Columbia Pictures in the early 1980s.<ref name="Movie Duels">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Movie Duels|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-movie-duels/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref> During the 1980s, HBO also held rights to films from TriStar Pictures (whose output deal with HBO, as well as that with Columbia Pictures, expired after 2004) and Orion Pictures;<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO, Warner May Sign Deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-03/business/fi-9224_1_movie-channel|author=David Crook|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=June 3, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=H.B.O.

===Sports programming===
HBO broadcasts a limited amount of sports programming as well as sports-related discussion and documentary series produced by the channel's HBO Sports division; HBO – through its parent holding company Home Box Office Inc. – also operates HBO PPV (formerly TVKO), which serves as a distributor of major [[boxing]] events for [[pay-per-view]].

HBO's first sports broadcast was of a New York Rangers-Vancouver Canucks NHL game, transmitted to a Service Electric cable system in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on November 8, 1972; the channel continued to run select NHL hockey games through the mid-1970s. HBO has long been known for its telecasts of boxing matches (which usually air on Saturday nights every two to three weeks on average), including those shown on its flagship sports program ''HBO World Championship Boxing''. In 1975, the "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier aired on HBO and was the first program on the pay cable network to be broadcast via satellite. [[1975 Wimbledon Championships|That same year]], HBO began airing coverage of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]; it held rights to coverage of the tennis tournament through [[1999 Wimbledon Championships|1999]], when it lost the rights to sister network [[TNT (TV network)|TNT]] (owned by Time Warner's [[Turner Broadcasting System]] subsidiary).

In 1973, HBO aired a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] event from [[Madison Square Garden]], headlined by a match between [[George Steele]] and [[Pedro Morales]]. During the mid-1970s, HBO aired several basketball games from the [[National Basketball Association]] and [[American Basketball Association]] (notably, [[1976 ABA Playoffs|the last ABA Finals game]] in 1976, between the [[Brooklyn Nets|New York Nets]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]]). HBO also aired [[Professional Bowlers Association]] (PBA) events during the 1970s; [[Dick Stockton]] was the [[play-by-play]] announcer and Skee Foremsky served as the [[color commentator]] for the [[bowling]] telecasts.<ref>{{YouTube|title=1974 PBA New Jersey Open Introduction|id=2Yg-pQC96Qw|date=January 25, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

In 1977, HBO premiered the channel's longest-running program, and its first sports-related documentary and analysis series ''[[Inside the NFL]]''; HBO canceled the program in February 2008 after 30 seasons (the program was later acquired by rival premium channel Showtime, which began airing the series in September 2008). HBO expanded its boxing slate with the launch of ''Boxing After Dark'' in 1996, a program which showcases fights from up-and-coming boxing talents.

The network would build upon ''Inside the NFL'' with debut of additional sports talk and documentary programs: ''[[Race for the Pennant]]'' (concerning the [[Major League Baseball]] season, running from 1978 to 1992), ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'' (which debuted in 1998), ''[[On the Record with Bob Costas]]'' (which debuted in 2001, and was revamped as ''[[Costas Now]]'' in 2005, ending in 2009), and ''[[Joe Buck Live]]'' (which ran for one season in 2009). In 2001, HBO and [[NFL Films]] began to jointly produce the documentary series ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)|Hard Knocks]]'', which follows an individual [[National Football League|NFL]] team each season during [[training camp]] and their preparations for the upcoming football season.<ref name="An Original Voice"/><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Hard Knocks|url=http://www.hbo.com/hardknocks/|publisher=Home Box Office Inc.|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

HBO Sports has been headed by several well-known television executives over the years, including its founder Steve Powell (later head of programming at [[ESPN]]), Dave Meister (later head of the [[Tennis Channel]]), Seth Abraham (later head of [[MSG Network]]),<ref name="An Original Voice"/> and [[Ross Greenburg]].

===Documentaries===

Many of HBO's documentary series appear under the ''[[America Undercover]]'' brand, the regular features of which have been ''[[Real Sex]]'' (a late night magazine-formatted series of specials that ran from 1992 to 2009, which frankly explored a variety of mainstream and non-mainstream sexual matters<ref name="An Original Voice"/>) and ''[[Autopsy (TV series)|Autopsy]]''. One of the most notable ''America Undercover'' specials was 1985's ''Soldiers in Hiding'', focusing on homeless veterans of the [[Vietnam War]] living in the wilderness, which won the first [[Academy Award]] for a cable television service in the Best Documentary category (although HBO has had some of its documentaries enter limited theatrical release to qualify for Oscar nominations in later years).<ref name="An Original Voice"/> HBO is also noted for its ''Sports of the 20th Century'' documentary brand. One of its most recent documentaries was ''Dare to Dream'', about the [[U.S. Women's Soccer Team]] and their effort to make a difference, and featured [[Mia Hamm]], [[Kristine Lilly]], [[Brandi Chastain]], [[Joy Fawcett]] and [[Julie Foudy]].

HBO's first successful documentary aired in 1979, the six-part series ''[[Time Was]]'', which featured host [[Dick Cavett]] being inserted into seminal events occurring between the 1920s and the 1970s. 1981's ''She's Nobody's Baby'', produced by ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, was another well-known documentary tracing the evolution in the societal role of American women during the 20th Century; the special earned HBO the first [[Peabody Award]] won by a pay television service.<ref>{{cite web|title=41st Annual Peabody Awards|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/shes-nobodys-baby-the-history-of-american-women-in-the-20th-century|publisher=[[Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication]]|date=May 1982}}</ref> Since then, it has brought home numerous Peabody Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Shows that Brought Home Peabodys|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/hbo-shows-that-brought-home-peabodys|publisher= Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication}}</ref> HBO had also broadcast informational documentaries produced in partnership with ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' starting in 1980, focusing on subjects from product safety to finance to health.<ref name="An Original Voice"/> One such documentary, ''AIDS: Everything You and Your Family Need to Know…But Were Afraid to Ask'', which aired in 1987 at the height of the [[AIDS]] epidemic in the U.S., provided factual information on [[HIV-AIDS|AIDS and HIV]] and was hosted by then-[[Surgeon General of the United States|surgeon general]] [[C. Everett Koop]].<ref name="An Original Voice"/>

In 2004, guided by human rights activist [[Ansar Burney]], an HBO team for ''Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'' used a hidden camera to document slavery and torture in secret desert camps where boys under the age of five were trained to [[camel racing|race camels]], a national sport in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). This half-hour investigative report exposed a carefully hidden [[child slavery]] ring that bought or [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] hundreds of young boys in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], who were then forced to become camel jockeys in the UAE. The report also questioned the sincerity of U.S. diplomacy in pressuring the UAE, an ally to the United States, to comply with its own stated policy of banning the use of children under 15 from camel racing. The documentary won a Sports Emmy Award in 2004 for "Outstanding Sports Journalism" and the 2006 [[Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award]] for "Outstanding Broadcast Journalism". It also brought worldwide attention to the plight of child camel jockeys in the [[Middle East]] and helped the Ansar Burney Trust to convince the governments of [[Qatar]] and the UAE to end the use of children in the sport.

In 2006, film director [[Spike Lee]] made a two-part four-hour documentary on [[Hurricane Katrina]] called ''[[When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts]]''. Also in 2006, documentary artist [[Lauren Greenfield]] directed a feature-length film about four young women struggling with [[eating disorder]]s seeking treatment at the Renfrew Clinic in Florida, called ''[[Thin (film)|Thin]]''. 2008 saw the U.S. television premiere of ''[[Baghdad High]]'', a documentary that depicted the lives of four boys attending a high school in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], over the course of one year in the form of a video diary that was filmed by the boys themselves, who were given video cameras for the project.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|title=Girls, Gunfire and Despair: Senior Year for 4 Iraqi Boys|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/arts/television/04high.html|author=Mike Hale|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 4, 2008|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}</ref>

In November 2008, HBO paid low seven figures for U.S. television rights to Amy Rice and Alicia Sams's documentary, ''By the People: The Election of [[Barack Obama]]''. The film covers Obama's 2006 trip to [[Africa]], his presidential primary campaign, the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 general election]] and his [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]]. The documentary received theatrical release in New York City and [[Los Angeles]], and aired on HBO in November 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO inaugurates Obama doc|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117995410.html|author=Michael Jones|work=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 6, 2008}}</ref>

In November 2012, HBO aired a four-part documentary titled ''Witness'', each part of which is devoted to covering photojournalists in four conflict regions: [[Ciudad Juárez|Juarez]], [[Libya]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO's Witness Goes Inside the Pulse-Pounding World of Conflict Photographers|url=http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2012/11/hbo-witness/|author=Jakob Schiller|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=November 21, 2012}}</ref> On March 28, 2013, the channel premiered the [[Alexandra Pelosi]]-directed documentary about former [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Jim McGreevey]], ''[[Fall to Grace (documentary)|Fall to Grace]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fall to Grace|url=http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/fall-to-grace/index.html|work=HBO|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jim McGreevey Needs Your Approval|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/jim-mcgreevey-2013-4/|author=Carl Swanson|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> On April 10, 2013, HBO aired ''50 Children: The Rescue Mission of Mr. and Mrs. Kraus'', a documentary about the story of Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus, a Jewish couple from [[Philadelphia]] who traveled to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939 and, with the help of the [[B'rith Sholom]] fraternal organization, saved Jewish children in [[Vienna]] from likely death in the [[Holocaust]] by finding them new homes in Philadelphia. In April 2013, the channel aired a documentary about the purported abuse and brutal treatment of elephants titled ''[[An Apology to Elephants]]''.

==Other ventures==
In addition to its linear television channels, HBO has entered into other ventures:

===Television channels===

====Take 2====
In April 1979, HBO launched its first attempt at a spin-off service, Take 2. Designed as a family-oriented mini-pay service, Take 2 was essentially formatted as an alternative to HBO, without any R-rated program content. The channel was ultimately deemed a major failure due to low subscribership and limited carriage by cable providers, and ceased operations late that summer.<ref name="Movie Duels"/> HBO management analysized the mistakes that led to Take 2's downfall, which would result in the development of the network's second and more successful attempt at a secondary pay service, the movie-focused Cinemax, which launched on August 1, 1980.

====Festival====
[[File:hbosfestival.png|175px|right|thumb|Logo of HBO's early family-friendly service ''Festival''.]]	
[[File:FestivalChannelguide0188.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Example of ''Festival's'' monthly guide provided to subscribers (January 1988).]]
In 1987, HBO launched '''Festival''',<ref name="Festival program guide 1987">{{cite journal|title=Festival program guide|publisher=Home Box Office Inc.|date=1987}}</ref> a separate premium channel that was distinctively programmed to provide [[family-friendly]] fare, which featured [[Golden age (metaphor)|classic]] and recent hit movies, as well as HBO's original specials (which were branded when broadcast on the channel under the banner "Centerstage", which featured stand-up comedy, concert specials and [[ice skating]] shows) and documentaries.

Festival, whose on-air slogan was ''Quality Entertainment You Welcome Home'',<ref>{{cite journal|title=Festival program guide|publisher=Home Box Office Inc.|page=Front cover|date=January 1988}}</ref> had also broadcast collections of feature films featuring a particular movie star (known as "Star Salutes"). What differed Festival from HBO was that the former channel was programmed as a family-oriented service. Atypical for a premium service, Festival featured edited versions of R-rated movies that were recut in order to fit a PG rating and allowed only high-quality series, specials and movies to be broadcast on the channel's schedule.<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO Launching Service To Attract Older Audience|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-02-17/features/8601100851_1_hbo-festival-new-channel|author=Thomas Morgan|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|via=The New York Times|date=February 17, 1986}}</ref>

As Festival was designed as a mini-pay premium service (formatted similarly to Take 2 before it), the cost of a monthly subscription of the channel was also priced lower than that of HBO and Cinemax. Festival provided its subscribers with a color 20-page monthly program guide. Like HBO, Festival also ran occasional free preview periods, such as the October 30 to November 2, 1987 preview hosted by [[Tony Randall]]. The channel suffered from insufficient cable carriage as only a few providers carried Festival; as such, it could not compete with then-fellow premium service [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]], which also maintained a family-oriented programming format. Festival would eventually shut down in late 1988.<ref name="HBO Expanding the Brand"/><ref name="Festival program guide 1987"/>

====The Comedy Channel / Comedy Central====
In 1989, HBO created [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]], a [[cable channel]] that featured clips excerpted from stand-up comedy sets, comedic feature films and television series (using a programming model similar to the original format of MTV),<ref name="HBO Expanding the Brand"/> which launched on November 15 of that year. The channel competed with another startup comedy-oriented cable channel that debuted the following year, Viacom-owned [[Ha! (TV channel)|Ha!: The TV Comedy Network]], which focused on reruns of older network sitcoms. Both channels suffered from insufficient cable carriage (both Ha! and The Comedy Channel each had fewer than 10 million subscribers). This resulted in Viacom and HBO reaching an agreement to merge Ha! and The Comedy Channel into a single channel called CTV: The Comedy Network, which debuted on April 1, 1991;<ref>{{cite news|title=2 Comedy Channels Will Merge|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D7163FF93AA25751C1A966958260|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 19, 1990}}</ref> the channel subsequently changed its name three months later to [[Comedy Central]] due to confusion and potential legal issues with Canadian broadcaster, the [[CTV Television Network]]. Time Warner/HBO exited the venture when Viacom bought out its 50% stake in Comedy Central for $1.23 billion in April 2003.<ref name="cnn03">{{cite news|title=Viacom buys Comedy Central|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/22/news/companies/viacom/index.htm|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=[[CNN Money]]|date=April 22, 2003|accessdate=August 3, 2007}}</ref>

===Television and film production===
HBO formed the production company HBO Independent Productions in 1990, which mainly served to produce [[sitcom]]s for broadcast television and basic cable (which included series such as ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'', ''[[Roc (TV series)|Roc]]'', ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''). [[HBO Downtown Productions]] was formed one year later, producing comedy specials for HBO, as well as program content for Comedy Central (such as ''[[Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]]'' and ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'').

HBO also operates HBO Films, which was established in 1999 as a reconfiguration and consolidation of two separate movie divisions operated by Home Box Office Inc., HBO NYC Productions and HBO Pictures. HBO also operated another film division called HBO Showcase, which began operations in 1986; it was shut down in 1996 and was relaunched as HBO NYC Productions.

HBO also participated in a number of [[joint venture]]s in film production:
* In 1982, HBO entered into a joint venture with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[CBS Theatrical Films]] to form [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] (the [[hyphen]] was dropped from the name in 1991), in order to pool resources to split the ever-growing costs of making feature films. Tri-Star's first production, ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'', was released in 1984. CBS sold its ownership stake in the studio in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> In April 1987, Tri-Star entered into the television production business with the formation of [[TriStar Television|Tri-Star Television]]. HBO relinquished its stake in Tri-Star that December, with Columbia Pictures buying its venture shares and merging Columbia and Tri-Star into Columbia Pictures Entertainment. {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, TriStar presently operates as a production arm of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]].
* In 1983, HBO entered into a [[limited partnership]] with [[Thorn EMI]] to create [[Silver Screen Partners]], which was the first LP of its kind that was developed for the purpose of financing the production of feature films. The studio only released seven films between 1983 and 1986, most of which were not commercial or critical successes, with the minor exception of the 1985 film ''[[Volunteers (film)|Volunteers]]''.<ref name="Movie Duels"/>
* In 1993, HBO invested in upstart film production company [[Savoy Pictures]] (co-founded by Victor A. Kaufman and Lewis J. Korman). The studio held investments in other properties including Savoy Broadcasting, a minority-owned communications firm, that evolved into [[SF Broadcasting]] (which was operated in a joint venture with the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], and affiliated its four stations with that network between September 1995 and January 1996). Savoy Pictures was unable to experience success with any of its feature film releases, and eventually folded in 1997.<ref name="Movie Duels"/>
* In 2005, HBO Films and New Line Cinema formed [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]], a worldwide theatrical distribution company for high-quality [[independent film]]s. The company was shut down in 2008 as part of the consolidation of New Line with its sister studio Warner Bros. Entertainment (Picturehouse [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Bob Berney would later resurrect the studio as an independent entity from Time Warner).<ref name="Movie Duels"/>

===Home video===
As objections to the advent of [[home video]] from factions of the entertainment industry began to die down, in November 1984, HBO partnered with independent film distributor Thorn EMI to form Thorn EMI/HBO Video.<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' (December 1, 1984, page 6)</ref> Thorn EMI cut various distribution agreements with smaller film production companies that did not have their own home video units, such as Orion Pictures and New Line Cinema.<ref name="HBO Expanding the Brand"/> In 1986, [[Cannon Films]] bought out Thorn EMI's interest in the unit, which was accordingly renamed HBO/Cannon Video. Cannon dropped out of the venture by 1987 after the studio took a financial hit following its attempt at a series of larger budget films that did not experience box office success; the unit was then renamed HBO Video.<ref name="HBO Expanding the Brand"/> Over time, HBO Video (which eventually became HBO Home Entertainment by the early [[2010s (decade)|2010s]]) shifted away from releasing films from independent studios to releasing HBO's catalog of original programs on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]].<ref name="HBO Expanding the Brand"/>

===Merchandising===
Various products have been marketed that have used the HBO trademark and/or are based around the channel's programming. In 2005, HBO entered into an agreement with [[AT&T Mobility|Cingular Wireless]] to establish HBO Mobile.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO, Cingular pact for exclusive mobile deal|url=http://www.tv.com/news/hbo-cingular-pact-for-exclusive-mobile-deal-2700/|agency=Reuters|work=[[TV.com]]|date=December 16, 2005}}</ref> Operating as a pay service (a model similar to that used by the channel itself), HBO Mobile featured information on HBO's original programming (including episode guides), [[mobile wallpaper]]s and [[ringtone]]s voiced by cast members of the channel's series (HBO Mobile also operated a similar service, HBO Family Mobile, which offered full-length episodes of the channel's children's programming). That same year, [[Mattel]] and [[Screenlife]] released a version of the DVD interactive game ''[[Scene It?]]'', featuring trivia relating to HBO's original series.

==Branding==
{{overly-detailed|section=y|date=December 2014}}
When HBO launched in 1972, its original logo was merely the channel's full name "Home Box Office" and a ticket stub surrounded by a lighted [[marquee (sign)|marquee]]. The original version of its current logo (designed by [[Bemis Balkind]]) was introduced in 1975, using an uppercase bold 'HBO' text with a circle inside the 'O', which in turn cuts into the 'B'. The logo was modified in 1980 (although it did not completely replace the original version until 1981), with the 'B' and the 'O' becoming full letterforms, albeit continuing to be attached to each other. The simplicity of the logo makes it fairly easy to duplicate, something HBO has taken advantage of many times over the years.

The logo became iconic due to a program opening sequence produced in 1981 by New York City production firm [[Liberty Studios]], nicknamed "HBO in Space", which was used from September 20, 1982 to September 30, 1997.<ref>{{YouTube|title=HBO Intro – Behind the Scenes|id=agS6ZXBrcng|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> The original full version begins with a window shot of a family (or alternately, a married couple) in an apartment sitting down to watch HBO on their television set (which was replaced by a cloudscape that faded into the city sequence in late 1983), which transitions to a fly-through over a constructed model cityscape and countryside. A starburst – or "stargate effect" – then occurs following a pan towards a star-filled sky (which begins a shorter version of the sequence), unveiling a chrome-plated HBO logo that flies and rotates into view; colored light beams encircle the side of the "O," then flash to a partially animated sequence featuring more lights racing counter-clockwise in its interior on a silver axis, revealing "HBO Feature Presentation" or another program type (such as "Standing Room Only", "HBO Special" or "On Location") in block text, before additional beams sweep across the text and shine, with more flashing into a fade to black. Most variants of this sequence were discontinued in 1986, except for the feature presentation (which was relegated to the main primetime film), "Saturday Night Movie" and "Sunday Night Movie" variants. The "Saturday Night Movie" and "Sunday Night Movie" variants were discontinued in 1993. Many versions of the intro are available on [[YouTube]], including one uploaded to HBO's official YouTube channel.<ref>{{YouTube|title=HBO 1983 Intro (HBO)|id=i1NKoMNy5bY|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> The accompanying fanfare – originally composed for [[Score Productions]] by Ferdinand Jay Smith III of [[Jay Advertising]] – has become a musical signature for HBO, and has been used in feature presentation, upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers, and network IDs since 1998 with various arrangements from [[French horn|horns]] to [[piano]] being used over the years.

Another well-known HBO program opener, "Neon Lights", began movies airing outside of primetime from late October or early November 1986, to the fall of 1997. The sequence, set to a synth and electric guitar theme, begins with a purple HBO logo on a film strip with blue, green and pink light rays shooting through it as the strip rotates out of view; the lights shoot through several glowing CG slots until a flash of light hits a field of spheres in varying colors, which zoom out to form a light purple HBO logo overlaid by a cursive magenta "Movie" script against a black background with rows of light purple spheres.<ref>{{YouTube|title=HBO 1987 Movie Intro|id=Gc3CdRxNsZ8|date=June 24, 2008|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> From 1997 to 1998, HBO used several feature presentation bumpers designed by Pittard Sullivan featuring the network logo in different situations (such as a fish in water, a celebrity in a [[limousine]], a large HBO logo chasing a man and a neon HBO logo on the rooftop of a building); these sequences were also used by the network as IDs from 1997 to 2002, and in upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers until 2000.

From 1998 to April 1, 2011, HBO used a Pittard Sullivan-designed CGI feature presentation bumper sequence that features a flyover similar to the 1982 sequence, starting with the front of a movie theater featuring a marquee that reads "HBO Feature Presentation," and trekking through a country road, a snowy mountain road near a cliff and a desert road (respectively passing under a tower, tunnel and tanker truck shaped in the individual letters of the HBO logotype); this leads into a road in an urban neighborhood (with [[skyscraper]]s visible in the background) that becomes a bridge upon the city's [[downtown]] area, and lead to a slowing flyover toward and pan over an HBO logo-shaped lake that starts with several spotlights rapidly turning on and ends with a 3D animation of the "Feature Presentation" text. The closing animation that is seen both in the full version as well as a shorter version of the sequence (seen outside of weekend primetime films and Saturday film premieres, when the longer sequence was used).<ref>{{YouTube|title=YouTube-HBO Feature Presentation: 1999 version|id=KgdnknJuB74|date=February 2, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

The sequence was replaced on April 2, 2011 – as part of a new graphics package implemented on that date across the HBO multiplex channels – by a much shorter opening sequence designed by Jesse Vartanian (who also designed CGI teaser commercials for HBO's premiere telecast of the 2010 film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''), consisting only of a dark background with faint light auroras around the HBO logo and a simple "Feature Presentation" text animation, accompanied by soft orchestral music.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Feature Presentation|url=http://jvarta.com/THE-NEW-HBO-FEATURE-PRESENTATION|author=Jesse Vartanian|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>

Unlike other pay television networks (including the multiplex channels of sister channel Cinemax), HBO does not brand its programming with [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen logo bugs]] of the main network and each respective multiplex channel – although its multiplex channels do display logo bugs during promotional breaks between programs.<ref>HBO on-air programming</ref>

==International versions==
{{main|HBO (international)}}
Since 1991, HBO has overseen a number of partnerships that operate HBO-branded television networks around the world. As HBO was launched in new markets, the brand has been used in several countries. HBO has established channels in various countries worldwide including [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Scandinavia]], [[the Caribbean]], Eastern [[Europe]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[the Netherlands]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. HBO also licenses its programming to air on certain other broadcast and cable channels outside the United States (such as [[Sky Atlantic]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), regardless as to whether an international version of HBO exists in the country.
