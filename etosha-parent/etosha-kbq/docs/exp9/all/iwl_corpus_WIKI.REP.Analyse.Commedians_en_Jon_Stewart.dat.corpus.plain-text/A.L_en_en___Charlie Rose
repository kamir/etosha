==Career==
After his wife was hired by the [[BBC]] (in New York), Rose handled some assignments for the BBC on a [[freelancer|freelance]] basis. In 1972, while working at New York bank [[Bankers Trust]], Rose landed a job as a weekend reporter for [[WPIX-TV]]. His "break" came in 1974, after [[Bill Moyers]] hired Rose as managing editor for the [[PBS]] series ''Bill Moyers' International Report.'' In 1975, Moyers named Rose executive producer of ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]].'' Rose soon began appearing on camera. "A Conversation with [[Jimmy Carter]]" that aired on Moyers's TV series ''U.S.A.: People and Politics'' won a 1976 [[Peabody Award]]. Rose then worked at several networks honing his interview skills until NBC affiliate [[KXAS-TV]] in [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]] hired him as program manager and provided the late-night time slot that became known as 'the Charlie Rose show.' {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Rose worked for [[CBS News]] (1984–1990) as the [[News anchor|anchor]] of ''[[CBS News Nightwatch]],'' the network's first late-night news broadcast, which often featured Rose doing one-on-one interviews with notable people in a similar format to his later PBS show.

On September 30, 1991, ''Charlie Rose'' premiered on PBS station [[WNET|Thirteen/WNET]]  and has been nationally syndicated on PBS since January 1993. In 1994, Rose moved the show to a studio owned by [[Bloomberg Television]], which allowed for high-definition video via satellite-remote interviews.<ref>[http://noir.bloomberg.com/tvradio/tv/crose/index.html Charlie Rose], ''[[Bloomberg News]]''</ref>
