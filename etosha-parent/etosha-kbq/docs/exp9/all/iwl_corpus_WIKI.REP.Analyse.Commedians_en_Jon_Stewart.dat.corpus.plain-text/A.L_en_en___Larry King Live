'''''Larry King Live''''' is <!-- Do not change "is" to "was", that is not correct for any no longer airing TV show. See WP:MOSTV#Lead_paragraphs--> an American talk show that was hosted by [[Larry King]] on [[CNN]] from 1985 to 2010. It was CNN's most watched and longest-running program, with over one million viewers nightly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/q107vs06.pdf |title=End Of Qtr Data-Q107 (minus 3 hours).xls |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Mainly aired from [[CNN|CNN's]] [[Los Angeles]] studios, the show was sometimes broadcast from [[Time Warner Center|CNN's studios]] in [[New York City|New York]] or [[Washington, D.C.]], where King gained national prominence during [[Larry King Show|his years as a radio interviewer]] for the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].<ref name=91int/> Every night, King interviewed one or more prominent individuals, usually [[celebrity|celebrities]], [[politics|politicians]] and [[business]]people.

The one-hour show was broadcast three times a day in some areas, and was seen all over the world on [[CNN International]].

On June 29, 2010, King announced that the program would be coming to an end.<ref name="bbcshowend">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/us_and_canada/10457092.stm|title=Larry King to end long-running US TV chat show|work=BBC News|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name="abcshowend">{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/larry-king-time-hang-suspenders/story?id=11052787|title=Larry King's Luminary Friends Chime in on His News|work=ABC News|last=Fisher|first=Luchina|author2=Braiker, Brian|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name=cnn10/> The "final edition" of the program aired on December 16,<ref name="endcnn">{{cite news|work=The Spy Report|publisher=Media Spy|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010|title=Larry King signs off from CNN talk show|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/12/17/us-larry-king-signs-off-from-cnn-talk-show/}}</ref> but a new episode on the war against cancer aired two days later on December 18.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1012/18/lkl.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com}}</ref>

''Larry King Live'' was replaced by ''[[Piers Morgan Live|Piers Morgan Tonight]]'', a talk show hosted by the British television personality and journalist [[Piers Morgan]], that began airing January 17, 2011.<ref name="signcnn">{{cite news|work=The Spy Report|publisher=Media Spy|date=September 9, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010|title=Piers Morgan signs on as Larry King replacement|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/09/09/us-piers-morgan-signs-on-as-larry-king-replacement}}</ref>

==Format==

===Interview style===
Larry King mainly conducted interviews from the studio, but he also interviewed people on-site in the [[White House]], their [[prison]] cells, their homes, and other unique locations. Critics have claimed that Larry King asks "soft" questions in comparison to other interviewers, which allows him to reach guests who would be averse to interviewing on "tough" talk shows. His reputation for asking easy, open-ended questions has made him attractive to important figures who want to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics.<ref name=NYT120110>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/europe/02putin.html |title=Blunt and Blustery, Putin Responds to State Department Cables on Russia |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company |author=Barry, Ellen |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=December 3, 2010}}</ref> When interviewed on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', King said that the secret to a good interview is to get the guest to talk about him- or herself, and to put oneself in the background pool.

A 1996 interview in the ''[[Washington Post]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} had King note that he sometimes slips hard questions in between softballs. King prefers one-sentence questions. In interviews, King has also proclaimed that he prepares as little as possible for each program, does not read the books of the authors he interviews,<ref name=91int>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-06-30/features/9101230817_1_larry-king-radio-show-previous-show/2|title=The Man Who Can`t Stop Talking Starting In South Florida, Larry King Has Been Live And On The Air For More Than 30 Years. On Radio And Tv, When The King Of Talk Speaks, The World Listens.|work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref> and admitted that the show was not journalism but "[[infotainment]]". He said that he tries to project an image of earnestness and sincerity in each interview, and the format of the show (King in suspenders instead of suit and tie, sitting directly next to the guest) reinforces that.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Larry King interviewing guest.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Interviewing a guest on ''Larry King Live''|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 20 October 2008}}]] -->
In response to {{" '}}softball' questions" accusations, King says, "I've never understood that. All I've tried to do is ask the best questions I could think of, listen to the answers, and then follow up. I've never not followed up. I don't attack anybody – that's not my style – but I follow up. I've asked people who say this, 'What's a softball question?' They'll say, 'You say to some movie star, what's your next project?' To me, that's not a softball. To me, that's interesting – what are you doing next?"{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Call-ins===
King accepted [[call-in]] questions on some nights. Callers were identified only by city and state/province, and generally not by name. Occasionally, surprise guests [[telephone]]d the show and comment, like [[governor]]s, [[Royal family|royalty]], and [[celebrities]]. At times, [[prank call]]s came in.

===Frequent topics===
During major election coverage, the program may center on political analysis and commentary, as the show's airing generally coincides with the closing of polls in many states.

One of King's recurring topics is the [[paranormal]]. A frequent guest is [[John Edward]] of the popular television show ''Crossing Over with John Edward''. Edward comes on the show and gives callers a free chance to supposedly communicate, via him, with their dead loved ones. King also had alleged psychics such as [[Sylvia Browne]] and [[James Van Praagh]] on from time to time to do readings and discuss the future. King sometimes allows skeptics such as [[James Randi]] to debate the psychics. In an April 2005 episode, King hosted a panel discussion regarding [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], [[Catholic]], [[Jewish]], [[Muslim]], and [[atheist]] views on the [[afterlife]]. King has also had topics about UFO's and Extraterrestrials where he pits believers against skeptics.

King is also frequently accused of pandering to [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] news stories; for instance, the death of [[Anna Nicole Smith]] took up much of King's shows after the event, causing the cancellation of numerous guests and interviews that were already scheduled, most notably [[Christopher Hitchens]], who had intended to discuss the Iraq situation.

After the death of a prominent celebrity, King would either replay a recent program featuring said celebrity (for instance, after actor [[Don Knotts]]' death in 2006 King replayed the interview with Knotts and [[Andy Griffith]] taken several months before) or will bring on family members and close confidantes to the deceased to reminisce on the departed's life.

===Set design===
Each studio set features an identical colored-dot map of the world in the background and one of King's trademarks, a vintage [[RCA]] microphone (as seen in the title card), on the desk. The microphone is a [[theatrical properties|prop]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauder|first1=David|title=Larry King exits CNN after 25 years|url=http://www.today.com/id/40707574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/larry-king-exits-cnn-after-years/#.VDoYFUu2_Io|publisher=Today}}</ref> as King and his guests use [[lapel microphone]]s.

King says his final show was not a "good-bye" but rather a "so long", as he plans to move on and pursue other things. The final show attracted an audience of 2.24&nbsp;million people, more than triple the program's usual audience of 672,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/12/18/2010-12-18_larry_king_ratings.html|title=Larry "King went out on top of the ratings race – if only for a night"|work=NY Daily News}}</ref>
