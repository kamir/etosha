The '''Comedy Cellar''' is a [[comedy club]] in [[Manhattan]], where many top New York comedians perform. It was founded in 1982 by then standup comedian, and current television writer/producer [[Bill Grundfest]]. It is located in the heart of [[Greenwich Village]] on 117 [[Macdougal Street]] between West 3rd Street and Minetta Lane. The upstairs portion is a restaurant called '''The Olive Tree Cafe''' to which it is connected, and where many of the comedians hang out after performing. The businesses share the same menu, kitchen, and staff. 

The Comedy Cellar, like [[The Comedy Store]], uses a showcase format, as opposed to a headline format like most clubs. A show will consist of between five and seven comics performing sets of roughly 20 minutes each.

Regular performers there include [[Todd Barry]], [[Colin Quinn]], ''[[Opie with Jim Norton]]'' co-host [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Mitch Fatel]], ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' star [[Darrell Hammond]], [[Dave Attell]], [[Louis C.K.]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128343426 |title=Comedian Louis C.K.: Finding Laughs Post-Divorce |accessdate=2010-07-08 |publisher=[[NPR]] }}</ref> [[Nick DiPaolo]], [[Artie Lange]], [[Dave Chappelle]], and podcast host [[Marc Maron]]. Also, some rising stars in comedy frequently perform, including [[Dov Davidoff]], [[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]], [[Sherrod Small]], [[Amy Schumer]], [[Keith Robinson (comedian)|Keith Robinson]], [[Gregg Rogell]], [[Nikki Glaser]], and [[Ben Bailey]].

Each week consists of two shows a night on Sunday through Thursday, three shows each Friday, and four shows on Saturday.

Much of Jerry Seinfeld's 2002 documentary ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'' was filmed at the club, and it also can be seen in a 2006 [[Pepsi]] commercial starring ''SNL'' star [[Jimmy Fallon]].

The beginning sequence of [[Louis CK]]'s television series ''[[Louie (TV series)|Louie]]'' shows him walking into the Comedy Cellar. Many scenes in the show are filmed in and around the Comedy Cellar and Olive Tree Cafe. Speaking with ESPN's [[Bill Simmons]] about the club on a [[Grantland]] podcast in June 2012, CK discussed playing shows at the Cellar to empty rooms in the 1990s, stating that then-owner Manny Dworman "kept comedy alive" by making comedians perform on empty stages, in an effort to lure in potential customers.<ref>http://espn.go.com/espnradio/grantland/player?id=8099523</ref> The club was also featured in [[Chris Rock]]'s film ''[[Top Five]]'', including a performance by his character, Andre Allen.
