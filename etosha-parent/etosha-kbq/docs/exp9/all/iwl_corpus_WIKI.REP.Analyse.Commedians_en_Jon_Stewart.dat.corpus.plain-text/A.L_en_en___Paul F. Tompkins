In 2015, Tompkins created his own podcast on the [[Earwolf]] podcast network called ''SPONTANEANATION with Paul F. Tompkins''. This podcast is similar to the ''Pod F. Tompkast'', however ''SPONTANEANATION'' is fully improvised and in-the-moment, as opposed to the ''Tompkast'', which was highly produced. ''SPONTANEANATION'' begins with an improvised monologue, accompanied on piano by Eban Schletter, much like the ''Pod F. Tompkast''. The next segment is an interview with one of Tompkins's famous friends. The final segment is one long improvised story performed by Paul and guest improvisers, based on ideas discussed in the interview segment.
