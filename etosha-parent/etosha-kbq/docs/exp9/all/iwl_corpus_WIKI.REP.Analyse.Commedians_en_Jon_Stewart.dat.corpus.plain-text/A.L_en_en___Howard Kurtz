===''The Fortune Tellers: Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media and Manipulation''===

===''Reality Show: Inside the Last Great Television News War''===
This 2007 book by Kurtz chronicles the struggles at the three "traditional" broadcast television networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) to enhance the stature, credibility and audience-draw of their various anchors of the evening network news programs.  The book's focus is specifically on ABC's [[Charles Gibson]], CBS's [[Katie Couric]] and NBC's [[Brian Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743299825|title=Reality Show: Howard Kurtz: 9780743299824: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/18/AR2007101801878.html "Weighing Anchors"] review by Marvin Kalb, Washington Post, October 21, 2007</ref>

==Personal opinions and potential conflicts of interest==
Kurtz has publicly declined to state his political affiliation.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/03/24/LI2005032401309.html "Critiquing the Press"] on washingtonpost.com</ref>  His opinions on various media issues are featured in his five published books about the media industry.

As a high-profile media critic and analyst, Kurtz's political leanings, multiple employers and potential conflicts of interest sometimes have been discussed or called into question by other media critics and pundits. Both liberal and conservative viewpoints have been perceived in his writing.<ref name="graff"/> Journalist [[Mickey Kaus]], reporting on and partially quoting from a letter by journalist [[Charles Kaiser]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'', wrote that Kurtz "has large, non-technical conflicts of interest, since he free-lances and takes money 'from the people he writes about, from [[Time Warner]] to [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]].'... One seemingly conflicting interest is Kurtz co-hosting CNN's ''Reliable Sources'', in of which he obtains monetary supplements as well as national renown."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kausfiles.com/archive/index.06.18.00.html|title=kaus files dot com|work=kausfiles.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>

Kurtz has received criticism from some for his perceived friendship and implicit support of controversial syndicated radio host [[Don Imus]]. Fox News commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] has criticized Kurtz for criticizing Fox News. The network had covered a story about the [[United States Justice Department]] regarding its prosecution of members of the [[New Black Panther Party]] for accusations of voter intimidation during the [[2008 United States Presidential Election]]. O'Reilly had criticized the network news media outlets, particularly [[Bob Schieffer]] of the [[CBS News]] talk show ''[[Face the Nation]],'' for not asking Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] about the story. When Kurtz talked about the topic to his audience on ''Reliable Sources,'' he had mentioned that Fox News was "pushing" the story. O'Reilly criticized Kurtz's description that Fox was pushing the story and said that Kurtz's own newspaper, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' had its own ombudsman Andrew Alexander say that it regretted not pursuing the story earlier due to newsworthiness.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/transcript/media-black-panthers-and-president-obama |work=Fox News | date=20 July 2010 | title=The Media, the Black Panthers and President Obama | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

<blockquote>
KURTZ: I think the argument that I've heard [[Keith Olbermann|Olbermann]] make in the past about Fox News – it's not an argument that I embrace – is that, because it poses as a news organization and puts out dangerous misinformation is a cheerleader for the Bush administration, that it's misinforming our society. But you know what? They're entitled to do that. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
</blockquote>

Kurtz's 2008 “Reliable Sources” interview of [[Kimberly Dozier]], a [[CBS]] journalist wounded in Iraq, was criticized by several members of the media due to the fact that Kurtz's wife  had been paid to serve as a publicist for Ms. Dozier’s memoir. During the interview, Kurtz praised Dozier and read passages of her book.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|title=CNN Reporter’s Interview Raises Ethical Questions|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/arts/television/29kurt.html|accessdate=25 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>
