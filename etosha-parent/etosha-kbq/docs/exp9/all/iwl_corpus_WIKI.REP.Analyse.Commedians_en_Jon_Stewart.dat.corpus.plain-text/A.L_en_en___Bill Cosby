'''William Henry''' "'''Bill'''" '''Cosby Jr.''' (born July 12, 1937) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and activist.

Cosby's start in [[stand-up comedy]] began at the [[hungry i]] in [[San Francisco]], followed by landing a starring role in the 1960s show ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]''. During its first two seasons, he was a regular on the [[children's television]] series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]''.

Using the Fat Albert character developed during his stand-up routines, Cosby created, produced, and hosted the animated comedy television series ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', a show centered on a group of young friends growing up in an urban area that ran from 1972 until 1985. Throughout the 1970s, Cosby starred in a number of films, occasionally returning to film later in his career. In 1976, Cosby earned a [[Doctor of Education]] degree from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. His dissertation discussed the use of ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' as a teaching tool in elementary schools.<!--linked at its mention within the main article below-->

Beginning in the 1980s, Cosby produced and starred in a television sitcom, ''[[The Cosby Show]]''; the show aired from 1984 to 1992 and was rated as the number one show in America for five years, 1984 through 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/trivia.php?showid=176 |title=Classic TV & Movie Hits - The Cosby Show |publisher=Classictvhits.com |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}</ref> The sitcom highlighted the experiences and growth of an affluent [[African-American]] family. Cosby produced the ''Cosby Show'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[A Different World]]'', which aired from 1987 to 1993; starred in the sitcom ''[[Cosby]]'' from 1996 to 2000; and hosted ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]'' for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000.

Since 2000, mainstream media have been reporting on an increasing number of cases accusing Cosby of [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] women, in many cases after purportedly drugging them, dating back from the 1960s to as recently as 2008. Cosby has never been criminally charged and denies all accusations.

As Cosby progressed through his undergraduate studies, he continued to hone his talent for humor, joking with fellow enlistees in the service and then with college friends.  When he began [[bartending]] at a Philadelphia club to earn money, he became more aware of his ability to make people laugh.  After using humor on his customers and seeing his tips increase, he then took his talent to the stage.<ref name="Verve Records">[http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist.aspx?ob=per&src=prd&aid=2842 Verve Records], retrieved May 31, 2006 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Stand-up career==
Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy, lining up standup jobs at clubs first in Philadelphia and then in [[New York City]], where he appeared at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] beginning in 1962.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> He booked dates in cities such as [[Chicago]], [[Las Vegas]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]]. He received national exposure on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in the summer of 1963. This led to a recording contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]], who, in 1964, released his debut LP ''[[Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!]]'', the first of a series of comedy albums.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risqué, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, "A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that ''we are alike. Right?'' So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."<ref>{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Ronald L. | title = Cosby: The Life of a Comedy Legend |publisher = [[Prometheus Books]] | year = 1997 | page = 57 | isbn = 1-57392-126-2}}</ref>

Younger, well-established comics like [[Jerry Seinfeld]] have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, but also as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television.  Seinfeld said of Cosby: "He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story.  He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote 'comic' and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see onstage."<ref name="GQ Bill Cosby Himself Tribute">{{cite web|last1=Penn|first1=Nathaniel|title=The 30th Anniversary of Bill Cosby: Himself —An All-Star Stand-Up Salute|url=http://www.gq.com/entertainment/humor/201306/bill-cosby-himself-30th-anniversary-june-2013|date=May 2013}}</ref>  Comedian [[Larry Wilmore]] also saw a connection between Cosby's standup, in the concert film [[Bill Cosby: Himself]], and the later success of the ''The Cosby Show'', saying: "It's clear that the concert is the template for ''The Cosby Show''."<ref name="GQ Bill Cosby Himself Tribute" />

Cosby remains an actively touring stand-up comedian, performing at theaters throughout the United States. He performed his first TV standup special in 30 years, ''Bill Cosby: Far From Finished'', on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013.<ref>Genzlinger, Neil (November 22, 2013).

==Acting career==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2014}}

===''I Spy''===
In 1965, Cosby was cast alongside [[Robert Culp]] in the ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' [[espionage]] adventure series on [[NBC]].  ''I Spy'' became the first weekly [[dramatic programming|dramatic television series]] to feature an African American in a starring role.<ref name="The Atlantic on Cosby Conservatism">{{cite web|last1=Coatesq|first1=Ta-Nehisi|title=‘This Is How We Lost to the White Man’: The audacity of Bill Cosby’s black conservatism|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/05/-this-is-how-we-lost-to-the-white-man/306774/|website=TheAtlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly|accessdate=24 April 2015|date=May 2008}}</ref>  At first Cosby and NBC executives were concerned that some affiliates might be unwilling to carry the series. At the beginning of the 1965 season, four stations declined the show; they were in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Andrew Grant|title=1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music|date=2015|publisher=St. Martins Press|isbn=978-1-250-05962-8|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QI3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=ispy+Georgia,+Florida,+and+Alabama&source=bl&ots=2oUP3E1fU9&sig=PJhB-eYUXcYlVEPZwRQmHyWQgRA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZYA6VYTuJemRsQTImYGoAQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ispy%20Georgia%2C%20Florida%2C%20and%20Alabama&f=false|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>  Viewers were taken with the show's exotic locales and the authentic chemistry between the stars, and it became one of the ratings hits of that television season. ''I Spy'' finished among the twenty most-watched shows that year, and Cosby would be honored with three consecutive [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]].<ref name="New Yorker Profile">{{cite web|last1=Sanneh|first1=Kelefa|title=The Eternal Paternal Bill Cosby’s never-ending tour.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/eternal-paternal|website=NewYorker.com|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 April 2015|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref>  When accepting his third Emmy for the show, Cosby told the audience: “Let the message be known to bigots and racists that they don’t count!”<ref name="New Yorker Profile" />

During the run of the series, Cosby continued to do [[stand-up comedy]] performances and recorded a half-dozen record albums for Warner Bros. Records. He also began to dabble in singing, recording ''[[Silver Throat: Bill Cosby Sings]]'' in 1967, which provided him with a hit single with his recording of [[Little Ole Man (Uptight, Everything's Alright)]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  As a single, the song sold over one million copies in the U.S. (achieving "gold" status), and hit number 4 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart. He would record several more musical albums into the early 1970s, but he continued to record primarily stand-up comedy work.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In June 1968, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that Cosby had turned down a five-year, US$3.5 million contract renewal offer and would leave the label in August that year to record for his own record label.<ref>"Cosby To Exit WB in August To Join Own Record Firm", Billboard, June 1, 1968, p.1</ref>

[[Tetragrammaton Records]] was a division of the Campbell, Silver, Cosby (CSC) Corporation, the Los Angeles-based production company founded by Cosby, his manager Roy Silver, and filmmaker Bruce Post Campbell. It produced films as well as records, including Cosby's television specials, the [[Fat Albert]] cartoon special and series and several motion pictures. CSC hired industry veteran [[Artie Mogull]] as President of the label and Tetragrammaton was fairly active during 1968–69 (its most successful signing was British heavy rock band [[Deep Purple]]) but it quickly went into the red and ceased trading during 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/la/tetragrammaton/tetragrammaton.html|title=TetragrammatonAlbum Discography|publisher=|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref>

===''Fat Albert'', ''The Bill Cosby Show'', and the 1970s===
[[File:Bill cosby 1969.JPG|thumb|upright|Cosby in 1969]]
Cosby pursued a variety of additional television projects and appeared as a regular guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and as the star of an annual special for NBC. He returned with another series in 1969, ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', a situation comedy that ran for two seasons. Cosby played a physical education teacher at a Los Angeles high school.  While only a modest critical success, the show was a ratings hit, finishing eleventh in its first season.  Cosby was lauded for using African-American performers such as [[Lillian Randolph]], [[Moms Mabley]], and [[Rex Ingram (actor)|Rex Ingram]] as characters.  According to commentary on the Season 1 DVD's for the show, Cosby was at odds with [[NBC]] over his refusal to include a [[laugh track]] in the show (he felt that viewers had the ability to find humor for themselves when watching a TV show). He was originally contracted with [[NBC]] to do the show for two seasons, and he believes the show was not renewed afterwards for that reason.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

After ''The Bill Cosby Show'' left the air, Cosby returned to his education. He began graduate work at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. For the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', Cosby recorded several segments teaching reading skills to young children.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1972, Cosby received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and was also back in prime time with a variety series, ''[[The New Bill Cosby Show]]''. However, this time he met with poor ratings, and the show lasted only a season. More successful was a Saturday morning show, ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', hosted by Cosby and based on his own childhood. That series ran from 1972 to 1979, and as ''The New Fat Albert Show'' in 1979 and ''The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Some schools used the program as a teaching tool,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and Cosby himself wrote a dissertation on it, "An Integration of the Visual Media Via 'Fat Albert And The Cosby Kids' Into the Elementary School Curriculum as a Teaching Aid and Vehicle to Achieve Increased Learning", as partial fulfillment of obtaining his 1976 doctorate in education, also from the University of Massachusetts.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>The first 22 pages of his dissertation are available at the [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=756476461&Fmt=14&VType=PQD&VInst=PROD&RQT=309&VName=PQD&TS=1270441368&clientId=79356 UMI ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts, publication number AAT 7706369]</ref> Subsequently, Temple University, where Cosby had begun but never finished his undergraduate studies, would grant him his [[bachelor's degree]] on the basis of "life experience."<ref>{{cite web|last=Holznagel|title=From Dropout to Doctorate: A Bill Cosby Educational Timeline|url=http://www.who2.com/blog/2010/12/from-dropout-to-doctorate-a-bill-cosby-educational-timeline|work=Who2 Biographies|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref>

Also during the 1970s, Cosby and other African-American actors, including [[Sidney Poitier]], joined forces to make some successful [[comedy film]]s that countered the violent "[[blaxploitation]]" films of the era. ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974) and ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' (1975) were generally praised, but much of Cosby's film work has fallen flat. ''[[Mother, Jugs & Speed]]'' (1976), costarring [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Harvey Keitel]]; ''[[A Piece of the Action (film)|A Piece of the Action]]'', with Poitier; and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'', a compilation of four [[Neil Simon]] plays, were all panned. In addition, ''[[Cos (TV series)|Cos]]'' (1976) an hour-long variety show featuring puppets, sketches, and musical numbers, was canceled within the year. It was during this season that ABC decided to take advantage of this phase of Cosby's career by associating with [[Filmation]] (producers of ''Fat Albert'') in creating live-action segments starring Cosby for the 1964/1971 animated film ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]'', which made its network premiere on Christmas 1976, and aired subsequently in syndication. Cosby was also a regular on children's [[Public broadcasting|public television]] programs starting in the 1970s, hosting the "[[Picture Pages]]" segments that lasted into the early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===''The Cosby Show'' and the 1980s===
{{see also|Bill Cosby in advertising}}
Cosby's greatest television success came in September 1984 with the debut of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. The program aired weekly on NBC and went on to become the highest ranking sitcom of all time.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} For Cosby, the new situation comedy was a response to the increasingly violent and vulgar fare the networks usually offered.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Cosby is an advocate for humor that is family-oriented. He insisted on and received total creative control of the series, and he was involved in every aspect of the series. The show had parallels to Cosby's actual family life: like the characters Cliff and Claire Huxtable, Cosby and his wife [[Camille Cosby|Camille]] were college educated, financially successful, and had five children. Essentially a throwback to the wholesome family situation comedy, ''The Cosby Show'' was unprecedented in its portrayal of an intelligent, affluent, African-American family.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Much of the material from the [[Television pilot|pilot]] and first season of ''The Cosby Show'' was taken from his video ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]'', released in 1983. The series was an immediate success, debuting near the top of the ratings and staying there for most of its long run. ''The Cosby Show'' is one of only three American programs that have been #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] for at least five consecutive seasons, along with ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[American Idol]].''  ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine called the show "revolutionary",{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and ''[[Newsday]]'' concurred that it was a "real breakthrough."{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1987, Cosby attempted to return to film with the spy spoof ''[[Leonard Part 6]]''. Although Cosby himself was producer and wrote the story, he realized during production that the film was not going to be what he wanted and publicly denounced it, warning audiences to stay away.<ref name=yahoobio>{{cite web|publisher= Yahoo! Movies|title=Bill Cosby |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800036559/bio|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> Cosby even went so far as to personally collect the [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] the film received on [[Joan Rivers]]' late-night talk show.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

After ''The Cosby Show'' went off the air in 1992, Cosby embarked on a number of other projects, including a [[revival (television)|revival]] of the classic [[Groucho Marx]] game show ''[[You Bet Your Life#1992 Bill Cosby version|You Bet Your Life]]'' (1992–93) along with the [[Television movie|TV-movie]] ''[[I Spy Returns]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Cosby Mysteries]]'' (1994). In the mid-1990s, he appeared as a detective in [[black-and-white]] [[film noir]]-themed commercials for [[Turner Classic Movies]]. He made appearances in three more films: ''[[Ghost Dad]]'' (1990), ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|The Meteor Man]]'' (1993), and ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'' (1996). In addition, he was interviewed in [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997), a documentary about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|1963 racist bombing]] of a church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Also in 1996, he started up a new show for CBS, ''[[Cosby]]'', again co-starring [[Phylicia Rashād]], his onscreen wife on ''The Cosby Show''. Cosby co-produced the show for [[Carsey-Werner Productions]]. The show was based on the British program ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It centered on Cosby as Hilton Lucas, an iconoclastic senior citizen who tries to find a new job after being downsized and, in the meantime, gets on his wife's nerves. [[Madeline Kahn]] costarred as Rashād's goofy business partner Pauline. Cosby was hired by CBS to be the official spokesman of the [[WWJ-TV]] during an advertising campaign from 1995 to 1998. Cosby hosted a CBS special, ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]'' on February 6, 1995, which was followed after as a full season show, with Cosby as host, from January 9, 1998 to June 23, 2000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F. |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=October 17, 2007|edition=9|pages=736–737|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref>

After four seasons, ''Cosby'' was canceled. Its last episode aired April 28, 2000. ''Kids Say the Darndest Things'' was terminated the same year, and Cosby continued to work with CBS through a development deal and other projects.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A series for preschoolers, ''[[Little Bill (TV series)|Little Bill]]'', made its debut on [[Nickelodeon]] in 1999. The network renewed the popular program in November 2000. In 2001, Cosby's agenda included the publication of a new book, as well as delivering the commencement addresses at [[Morris Brown College]], Ohio State University, and at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].<ref name="rpi_grad">[http://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=469&setappvar=page(1) ''Bill Cosby to be Rensselaer’s Commencement Speaker'']</ref> Also that year, he signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to develop a [[live-action]] feature film centering on the popular [[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids|Fat Albert]] character from his 1970s cartoon series. ''[[Fat Albert (film)|Fat Albert]]'' was released in theaters in December 2004. In May 2007 he spoke at the Commencement of [[High Point University]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Shawn Upshaw paternity lawsuit===
In July 1997, Cosby testified that he made private payments to Shawn Upshaw, a woman who had briefly been his lover in Las Vegas during the early 1970s. Upshaw later told Cosby that he was the father of her daughter, [[Autumn Jackson]]. Cosby denies being the father and said that he gave Upshaw a total of about $100,000 because he did not want her to publicly reveal the affair.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldman |first=John |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |title=Cosby Testifies About Secret Payments |date=July 16, 1997}}</ref> Twenty-two-year-old Autumn Jackson was sentenced to 26 months in jail for trying to extort $40&nbsp;million from Cosby.  In the trial and subsequent appeal, the courts held that Jackson's belief as that she was Cosby's child—even if sincere—was irrelevant to the question of her guilt.  The courts stated that the mere fact that she was Cosby's child would not have given entitled her to the $40 million she demanded, and therefore the demand was extortionate whether or not she believed herself to be Cosby's daughter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/nyregion/judges-reinstate-conviction-in-extortion-of-bill-cosby.html?ref=autumnjackson |last=Weiser |first=Benjamin |title=Judges Reinstate Conviction In Extortion of Bill Cosby |date=November 16, 1999 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Although both Jackson and Cosby stated at various times that they were willing to undergo DNA testing to determine Jackson's paternity, the two sides never reached an agreement as to when and how to perform the test.  After Jackson's conviction, Cosby provided a blood sample for testing, but Jackson refused to participate until after her sentencing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Woman refuses test to see if Bill Cosby is her father|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9707/29/cosby/|accessdate=25 April 2015|date=July 26, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gliatto|first1=Tom|title=The Tears of Autumn|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20122869,00.html|website=People.com|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=25 April 2015|date=August 11, 1997}}</ref>  It appears that the test was never completed.

===Sexual assault allegations===

In the "Pound Cake" speech, Cosby asked that African-American parents teach their children better morals at a younger age.

Board of Education'' decision."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37869-2004May18.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Publicists With a Cannes-Do Attitude|date=May 19, 2004}}</ref>

Cosby again came under sharp criticism and was again largely unapologetic for his stance when he made similar remarks during a speech in a July 1 meeting commemorating the anniversary of ''Brown v. Board of Education''. During that speech, he admonished apathetic blacks for not assisting or concerning themselves with the individuals who are involved with crime or have counter-productive aspirations. He further described those who needed attention as blacks who "had forgotten the sacrifices of those in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Lauds Bill Cosby as "Hometown Hero"|url=http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&sectiontree=32,34&itemid=510|publisher=fattah.house.gov|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Georgetown University]] sociology professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] wrote a book entitled ''Is Bill Cosby Right? Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?''<ref name="Dyson">{{cite map|publisher= National Public Radio|title=Is Bill Cosby Right or Is the Black Middle Class Out of Touch?|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4628960|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}</ref> In the book, Dyson wrote that Cosby was overlooking larger social factors that reinforce poverty and associated crime; factors such as deteriorating schools, stagnating wages, dramatic shifts in the economy, offshoring and downsizing, chronic underemployment, and job and [[capital flight]].<ref name="Dyson column">{{cite map|publisher=The Washington Post|title=The Injustice Bill Cosby Won't See|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/20/AR2006072001631.html|first=Michael Eric|last=Dyson|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref> Dyson suggested that Cosby's comments "betray classist, elitist viewpoints rooted in generational warfare."<ref name="Dyson"/>

[[Cornel West]] defended Cosby and his remarks, saying, "he's speaking out of great compassion and trying to get folk to get on the right track, 'cause we've got some brothers and sisters who are not doing the right things, just like in times in our own lives, we don't do the right thing... He is trying to speak honestly and freely and lovingly, and I think that's a very positive thing."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200405/20040526_cosby.html Cornel West radio clip] played on ''[[Tavis Smiley]]'' edition "Bill Cosby: Airdate May 26, 2004"</ref>

In a 2008 interview, Cosby mentioned [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]; [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]], among the cities where crime was high and young African-American men were being murdered and jailed in disproportionate numbers. Cosby stood his ground against criticism and affirmed that African-American parents were continuing to fail to inculcate proper standards of moral behavior.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/race/2008/06/four-years-ago.html|title=Cosby to blacks: Come on people, it's time for change|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=June 2, 2008}}</ref> Cosby still lectures to black communities (usually at churches) about his frustrations with certain problems prevalent in underprivileged urban communities, such as illegal drugs; teenage pregnancy; [[Black Entertainment Television]]; high-school dropouts; [[anti-intellectualism]]; [[gangsta rap]]; vulgarity; thievery; offensive clothing; vanity; [[parental alienation]]; single-parenting; and failing to live up to the ideals of [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and African-Americans who preceded [[Generation X]].

Cosby has also been openly critical of conservative Republican politicians in regards to their views on socioeconomic and racial issues. In a 2013 CNN interview regarding voting rights, Cosby stated "this Republican Party is not the Republican Party of 1863, of Abraham Lincoln, abolitionists and slavery, is not good. I think it's important for us to look at the underlying part of it. What is the value of it? Is it that some people are angry because my people no longer want to work for free?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bet.com/news/politics/2013/03/06/bill-cosby-sounds-off-on-the-gop.html|work=BET|title=http://www.bet.com/news/politics/2013/03/06/bill-cosby-sounds-off-on-the-gop.html|date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>
