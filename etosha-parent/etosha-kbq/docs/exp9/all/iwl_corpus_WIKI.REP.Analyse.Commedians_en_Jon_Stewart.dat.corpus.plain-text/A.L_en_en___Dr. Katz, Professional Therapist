'''''Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist''''' is an American [[animated series]] that originally ran on [[Comedy Central]] from May 28, 1995 to December 24, 1999, with a final set of three shelved episodes airing in 2002, starring [[Jonathan Katz]], [[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]], and [[Laura Silverman]]. The show was created by [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California production company Popular Arts Entertainment (executive producers: Tim Braine, Kevin Meagher, and David Pritchard), with Jonathan Katz and [[Tom Snyder (producer)|Tom Snyder]], developed and first made by Popular Arts for [[HBO Downtown Productions]]. Boston-based [[Tom Snyder Productions]] became the hands-on production company, and the episodes were usually produced by Katz and [[Loren Bouchard]]. It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 1998.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/dr.-katz-professional-therapist 58th Annual Peabody Awards], May 1999.</ref>

The show was [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] in a crude, easily recognizable style produced with the software [[Squigglevision]] (a device Snyder had employed in his educational animation business) in which all persons and animate objects are colored and have constantly squiggling outlines, while most other inanimate objects are static and usually gray in color.<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION REVIEW; Meet the Small Family, A Year After the Divorce|work= New York Times|date=April 26, 1999|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/26/arts/television-review-meet-the-small-family-a-year-after-the-divorce.html?scp=9&sq=Dr.%20Katz,%20Professional%20Therapist&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-12 | first=Ron | last=Wertheimer}}</ref>
The original challenge Popular Arts faced was how to repurpose recorded [[stand-up comedy]] material. To do so, they based Dr. Katz's patients on stand-up comics for the first several episodes, simply having them recite their stand-up acts. The secondary challenge was how to affordably animate on cable TV at the time. Snyder (a boyhood friend of Braine's) had Squigglevision, an inexpensive means of getting animation on cable, which could not afford traditional animation processes. A partnership between Popular Arts, Tom Snyder Productions and Jonathan Katz was formed, and ''Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist'' was born.

==Format==
The show focused on the title character, Dr. Jonathan Katz, who was voiced by, and visually based on, the [[Jonathan Katz|comedian of the same name]]. Dr. Katz was a professional [[psychotherapist]] who had famous comedians and actors as patients, usually two per episode.<ref>{{cite news|title= Laugh Therapy|work= Chicago Tribune|date=December 1, 1995|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-01/features/9512010019_1_dr-katz-jonathan-katz-comedy-central|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=Steve | last=Johnson}}</ref> The comedians' therapy sessions generally consisted of them doing their onstage material while Dr. Katz offered insights or simply let them [[Monologue|rant]]. Meanwhile, therapy sessions featuring actors and actresses offered more interpersonal dialogue between Katz and his patient to better suit their predisposition. Dr. Katz is a very laid-back, well-intentioned man who enjoys playing the guitar and spending time at the bar with his friend Stanley and the bartender, Julie.<ref>{{cite news|title= For Him, Laughter Was the Best Therapy|work= The New York Times|date=December 14, 2008|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/arts/television/14milv.html|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=Erika | last=Milvy}}</ref>

Interspersed with these scenes were scenes involving Dr. Katz's daily life, which included his aimless, childish 24-year-old son, Ben ([[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]]), his uninterested and unhelpful secretary, Laura ([[Laura Silverman]]), and his two friends: Stanley (Will LeBow), and the barmaid, Julie, voiced by one of the show's producers, Julianne Shapiro. In later episodes, Todd ([[Todd Barry]]), the video store clerk, became a regular character.

Each show would typically begin with Dr. Katz and Ben at breakfast and initiating a plotline. These plots included events like Ben attempting to become a [[disc jockey|radio personality]], believing he is in possession of [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]], or the [[morality|moral]] conundrum he suffers after receiving a chain letter. The development of these plotlines would occur in alternation with the segments between Dr. Katz and his guests.

The show would end in a similar way each week: while Dr. Katz was in a session with a patient, music signaling the close of the show would begin to play. Katz would acknowledge it by saying, "Whoops, you know what the music means... our time is up" or some variant thereof.

Much of the show's content, particularly dialogue between Katz and Ben, was [[improvisational comedy|improvised]] through a process called "[[retroscripting]]", in which a vague outline is developed but the actual dialogue is ad-libbed. This style, as well as Squigglevision, would reappear in ''[[Home Movies (cartoon series)|Home Movies]]'', a cartoon on which many members of the Dr. Katz cast and crew worked.

==Original airing==
The first episode of ''Dr. Katz'' aired on May 28, 1995. A total of 81 episodes were produced, with the sixth and final season (of 18 episodes) beginning on June 15, 1999. Only the first six of the episodes were aired on Comedy Central immediately, though they did air in international markets. After a five-month delay, another nine episodes ran during a Christmas Eve marathon. The final three episodes were broadcast for the first time in the United States on February 13, 2002, during an event dubbed "Dr. Katz goes to the Final Three."

==Comic strip==
A [[comic strip]] of the same name was produced by the LA Times syndicate from March 1997 to January 2000. One book collection was published, ''Hey, I've Got My Own Problems''. Writers included [[Bill Braudis]] and [[Dave Blazek]], with artwork by [[Dick Truxaw]].

==Live action production==
In 2007, Comedy Central presented ''An Evening with Dr. Katz: Live from the Comedy Central Stage'', a live-action special taped in front of a live audience at the Hudson Theater on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in Los Angeles, featuring Jonathan Katz reprising his role as Dr. Katz. Comedians [[Maria Bamford]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Andy Kindler]] and [[Paul F. Tompkins]] appeared in person as celebrity "clients"; Jon Benjamin and Laura Silverman reprised their respective roles from the animated series. This special was included in the "Complete Series" DVD compilation.
