'''Walter Matthau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|θ|aʊ}};<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Matthau-Walter Matthau, Walter - Oxford Dictionaries]</ref> October 1, 1920 – July 1, 2000) was an [[Americans|American]] actor best known for his role as [[Oscar Madison]] in ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' and his frequent collaborations with ''Odd Couple'' star [[Jack Lemmon]], as well as his role as Coach Buttermaker in the 1976 comedy ''[[The Bad News Bears]]''. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in the 1966 [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[The Fortune Cookie]].'' Besides the Oscar, he was the winner of BAFTA, Golden Globe and Tony awards.

As a young boy, Walter attended a Jewish non-profit sleepaway camp, Tranquillity Camp, where he first began acting in the shows the camp would stage on Saturday nights. He also attended Surprise Lake Camp. His high school was [[Seward Park High School]].<ref name=seward>{{cite web|url=http://www.sewardparkhs.com/Famous-Alumni|publisher=Seward Park High School Alumni Association|title=Famous Alumni|accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref> He had a brief career as a [[Yiddish Theater District]] concessions stand cashier.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|last=Cofone|first=Annie|url=http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/stepping-back-into-the-golden-age-of-yiddish-theater/#more-35481|title=Strolling Back Into the Golden Age of Yiddish Theater|publisher=NYTimes.com| work=The New York Times|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref>

==Career==
During [[World War II]], Matthau served in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] with the [[Eighth Air Force]] in England as a [[B-24 Liberator]] radioman-gunner, in the same [[453rd Bombardment Group]] as [[James Stewart]]. He was based at [[RAF Old Buckenham]] during this time. He reached the rank of [[staff sergeant]] and became interested in acting. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} He took classes in acting at the [[Dramatic Workshop]] of [[The New School]] with German director [[Erwin Piscator]]. He often joked that his best early review came in a play where he posed as a derelict. One reviewer said, "The others just looked like actors in make-up, Walter Matthau really looks like a [[skid row]] bum!" Matthau was a respected [[theatre|stage]] actor for years in such fare as ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' and ''[[L'Idiote|A Shot in the Dark]]''. He won the 1962 [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actor in a play. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Walter Matthau Art Carney The Odd Couple Broadway 1965.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Matthau and [[Art Carney]] in ''[[The Odd Couple]]'', 1965]]
In 1952, Matthau appeared in the pilot of ''[[Mr. Peepers]]'' with [[Wally Cox]]. For reasons unknown he used the name Leonard Elliot. His role was of the gym teacher Mr. Wall. In 1955, he made his [[film|motion picture]] debut as a whip-wielding bad guy in ''[[The Kentuckian]]'' opposite [[Burt Lancaster]].

Matthau appeared as a villain in subsequent movies, such as 1958's ''[[King Creole]]'' (in which he is beaten up by [[Elvis Presley]]). That same year, he made a [[western movie|western]] called ''[[Ride a Crooked Trail]]'' with [[Audie Murphy]] and ''[[Onionhead]]'' starring [[Andy Griffith]] and [[Erin Joanne O'Brien|Erin O'Brien]], which was a flop. Matthau had a featured role opposite Griffith in the well received drama ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'', directed by [[Elia Kazan]]. Matthau also directed a low-budget 1960 movie called ''The Gangster Story''. In 1962, he was a sympathetic sheriff in ''[[Lonely are the Brave]]'', which starred [[Kirk Douglas]]. He appeared opposite [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]''.

Appearances on [[television]] were common too, including two on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s police drama, ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', as well as the 1963 episode "A Tumble from a Tall White House" of ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]''. He appeared eight times between 1962 and 1964 on ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'' and as Franklin Gaer in 1964 in the episode "Man Is a Rock" on ''[[Dr. Kildare]]''. Lastly, he starred in the syndicated crime drama ''[[Tallahassee 7000]]'', as a Florida-based state police investigator, in the 1961–1962 season.

Comedies were rare in Matthau's work at that time. He was cast in a number of stark dramas, such as 1964's ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]'', in which he portrayed Pentagon adviser Dr. Groeteschele, who urges an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union in response to an accidental transmission of an attack signal to U.S. Air Force bombers, in the tense and timely cold-war thriller.

In 1965, however, a plum comedy role came Matthau's way when [[Neil Simon]] cast him in the hit [[stage play|play]] ''[[The Odd Couple]]'', playing the slovenly sportswriter Oscar Madison, opposite [[Art Carney]] as [[Felix Unger|Felix Ungar]]. Matthau later reprised the role in the [[The Odd Couple (film)|film version]], opposite [[Jack Lemmon]] as Felix Ungar. Also in 1965, he played detective Ted Casselle in the Hitchcockian thriller ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'', with [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Diane Baker]], a film directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], based on a novel by [[Howard Fast]].

He achieved great film success in a 1966 comedy as a shyster lawyer called William H. "Whiplash Willie" Gingrich starring opposite Lemmon in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'', the first of numerous [[collaboration]]s with [[Billy Wilder]], and a role that would earn him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Filming had to be placed on a five-month hiatus after Matthau suffered a serious [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He gave up his three pack a day smoking habit as a result.<ref name="theguardian.com">http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jul/01/news</ref>

[[File:Walter Matthau.jpg|thumb|left|in a photo for ''A New Leaf'' (1972)]]
Matthau was visibly banged up during the Oscar telecast, having been involved in a bicycle accident; nonetheless, he scolded actors who had not bothered to come to the ceremony, especially the other major award winners that night: [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Sandy Dennis]] and [[Paul Scofield]].

Oscar nominations would come Matthau's way again for 1971's ''[[Kotch]]'', directed by Lemmon, and 1975's ''[[The Sunshine Boys (film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'', another Simon vehicle transferred from the stage, this one about a pair of former [[vaudeville]] stars. For the latter role he won a [[Golden Globe]] award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.

Broadway hits turned into films continued to cast Matthau in the leads with 1969's ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and that same year's ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', for which co-star [[Goldie Hawn]] received an Oscar. He played three roles in the 1971 film version of Simon's ''[[Plaza Suite (film)|Plaza Suite]]'' and was in the cast of its followup ''[[California Suite]]'' in 1978.

Matthau starred in three crime dramas in the mid-1970s, as a detective investigating a mass murder on a bus in ''[[The Laughing Policeman (film)|The Laughing Policeman]]'', as a bank robber on the run from the Mafia and the law in ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' and as a New York transit cop in the action-adventure ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]''. A change of pace about misfits on a [[Little League]] baseball team turned-out to be a solid hit in 1976, when Matthau starred as coach Morris Buttermaker in the comedy ''[[The Bad News Bears]]''

In 1982, Matthau portrayed Herbert Tucker in ''[[I Ought to Be in Pictures (film)|I Ought to Be in Pictures]]'', with [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Dinah Manoff]], the daughter of Matthau's ''Plaza Suite'' co-star, [[Lee Grant]].

[[File:Hello, Dolly!9.jpg|thumb|Matthau in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', 1969]]
Matthau played Albert Einstein in the film "[[IQ (film)|IQ]]", also starring Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan. His partnership with Lemmon became one of the most successful pairings in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making ''The Fortune Cookie'' and would make a total of 10 movies together—11 counting ''[[Kotch]]'', in which Lemmon has a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (though not together) in the 1991 [[Oliver Stone]] drama about the presidential assassination, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. In 1992, he played the narrator in ''[[Dr. Seuss|Doctor Seuss]] Video Classics: '''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'''''

Matthau played the role of Mr. Wilson in the 1993 movie ''[[Dennis the Menace (film)|Dennis the Menace]]''.

Matthau and Lemmon reunited in 1993 for the surprise{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} box-office hit comedy ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'', co-starring [[Ann-Margret]], and the 1995 sequel, ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]'', that also co-starred [[Sophia Loren]]. This led to more pairings late in their careers, notably ''[[Out to Sea]]'' and a Simon-scripted sequel to one of their great successes, ''[[The Odd Couple II]]''. ''[[Hanging Up]]'', a 2000 film directed by [[Diane Keaton]], was Matthau's final appearance onscreen.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Matthau was married twice; first to Grace Geraldine Johnson from 1948 to 1958, and then from 1959 until his death in 2000 to [[Carol Grace|Carol Marcus]]. He had two children, Jenny and David, by his first wife, and a son, [[Charles "Charlie" Matthau|Charlie Matthau]], with his second wife. David is a radio news reporter, currently at WKXW "[[WKXW|New Jersey 101.5]]" in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. Jenny is president of the Natural Gourmet Institute in New York City. Matthau also helped raise his stepchildren, [[Aram Saroyan]] and [[Lucy Saroyan]]. His grandchildren include William Matthau, an engineer, and Emily Rose Roman, a student at SUNY Binghamton. Charlie Matthau directed his father in ''[[The Grass Harp (film)|The Grass Harp]]'' (1995).

===Health problems===
A heavy smoker and drinker, Matthau suffered a heart attack in 1966, the first of at least three in his lifetime. In 1976, ten years after his first heart attack, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in freezing Minnesota weather for ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' in 1993, he was hospitalized for double pneumonia. In December 1995 he had a colon tumor removed; it tested benign. He was also hospitalized in May 1999 for more than two months after another bout of pneumonia.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> In November 1999, he was diagnosed with colon cancer shortly after completing his final acting role ''[[Hanging Up]]''.

===Gambling===
Matthau was a compulsive gambler, who once estimated his lifetime losses as five million dollars.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000527/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Walter Matthau grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Walter Matthau's grave]]
Matthau suffered from [[atherosclerotic heart disease]] and [[colon cancer]], which spread to his liver, lungs and brain.<ref>http://www.hollywoodmemoir.com/walter-matthau</ref> He died of a heart attack in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] on July 1, 2000. He was 79 years old.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news| title=Actor Walter Matthau dies| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/814676.stm| work=[[BBC News]]| publisher=BBC| accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref>  His remains are interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

Less than a year later, the remains of [[Jack Lemmon]] (who died of colon and bladder cancer) were buried at the same cemetery. After Matthau's death, Lemmon as well as other friends and relatives had appeared on ''[[Larry King]] Live'' in an hour of tribute and remembrance; many of those same people appeared on the show one year later, reminiscing about Lemmon.

[[Carol Grace|Carol Marcus]], also a native of New York, died of a [[brain aneurysm]] in 2003. Her remains are buried on top of Matthau's.

The remains of actor [[George C. Scott]] are buried to the left of those of Walter Matthau, in an unmarked grave, and [[Farrah Fawcett]]'s remains are buried to the right.
