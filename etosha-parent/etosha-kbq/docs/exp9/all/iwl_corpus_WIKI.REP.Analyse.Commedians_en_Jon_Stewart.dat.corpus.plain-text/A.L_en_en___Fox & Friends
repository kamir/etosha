'''''Fox & Friends''''' is an [[United States|American]] early-morning news and opinion talk show that begins at 6:00 a.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] with the latest ''[[Fox News Live]]'' headlines and news of the morning. It continues with a variety of segments including breaking news, interviews, updates of news stories with correspondents, and entertainment segments. 

== History ==
''Fox & Friends'' evolved from ''Fox X-press'', Fox News Channel's original morning news program.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], an additional hour was added to the beginning of the weekday show, but branded as a separate show called ''Fox & Friends First''. It was the first Fox News show to air live for the day, starting at 6:00 a.m. It was discontinued on July 13, 2008 and replaced with an additional hour of ''Fox & Friends''<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/changes-at-fox-friends_b20086 Changes at Fox & Friends], ''TVNewser'', July 14, 2008.</ref> The ''[[Fox & Friends First]]'' title was later reintroduced on March 5, 2012, also as a separate show airing one hour before the main three-hour program, but using a separate slate of rotating anchors.<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fox-friends-first-goes-on-the-air_b114985 ‘Fox & Friends First’ Goes on the Air], ''TVNewser'', March 5, 2012.</ref> After the show has ended for the day, a short online-only web show named ''After The Show Show'' which features behind-the-scenes footage not shown on air, is streamed on the Fox News website. It lasts from less than 3 minutes to 10 minutes.

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''Fox & Friends'' "has become a powerful platform for some of the most strident attacks on President Obama."<ref name="nyt">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Enemies and Allies for 'Friends' | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/arts/television/fox-friends-finds-ratings-and-controversy.html | first=  Jeremy | last = Peters | accessdate = June 22, 2012 | date = June 20, 2012}}</ref> The program has provided a platform for [[Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about Obama's religion]] and, in May 2012, aired a 4-minute video attacking Obama's record as President.<ref name="nyt"/> The video was widely criticized as a political attack ad masquerading as journalism,<ref name="nyt-video">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | url = http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/obama-video-on-fox-news-criticized-as-attack-ad/ | date = May 30, 2012 | first= Brian | last = Stelter | title = Obama Video on Fox News Criticized as Attack Ad | accessdate = June 22, 2012}}</ref><ref name="sun">{{cite news | work= [[Baltimore Sun]] | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bal-romney-fox-news-obama-attack-ad-20120530,0,2738139.story | title = With Romney now official, Fox News gets shamelessly political | first = David | last = Zurawik | date = May 30, 2012 | accessdate = June 22, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' television critic [[James Poniewozik]] wrote: "It’s hard to imagine a more over-the-top parody of Fox raw-meat-hurling, fear-stoking, base-pleasing agitprop."<ref name="time">{{Cite news | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | first= James | last = Poniewozik | accessdate = June 22, 2012 | date = May 31, 2012 | title = Fox News Produces Greatest Fox News Parody Video Ever | url = http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/31/fox-news-produces-greatest-fox-news-parody-video-ever/ | authorlink = James Poniewozik}}</ref>

In response, a Fox News exec vice-president 'disavowed' the video, blaming an associate producer and that the video 'slipped by' senior managers at the network.<ref name="bw">{{cite news | agency  = Associated Press | work = [[BusinessWeek]] | title = Controversial Fox News video: personnel hardball? | first = David | last = Bauder | url = http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-06/D9V6D2900.htm | date = June 4, 2012 | accessdate = June 22, 2012}}</ref> Fox stated that the show was entertainment and "does not pretend to be straight news."<ref name="nyt"/> Citing anonymous sources, the ''New York Times'' reported that some reporters, producers and executives at Fox were 'embarrassed' by the show, which remains by far the highest-rated cable show in its time slot as of June 2012.<ref name="nyt"/>

On October 5, 2013, while covering the government shutdown which had led to the closing of a veteran's museum, presenter Kooiman claimed that President Obama had offered "to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture". The story seemed to have been sourced from a spoof news website [[National Report]], and the following week an on-air apology was made for "reporting a story based on poor research that was not true".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-friends-host-anna-kooiman-apologizes-for-airing-phony-muslim-museum-story/|title=Fox & Friends Host Anna Kooiman Apologizes for Airing Phony Muslim Museum Story|date=14 October 2013|work=mediaite.com|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref>
