'''Charlton Heston''' (born '''John Charles Carter'''; October 4, 1923 – April 5, 2008) was an American actor and political activist.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Berkvist|title=Charlton Heston, Epic Film Star and Voice of N.R.A., Dies at 84.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/movies/06heston.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin|quote=Charlton Heston, who appeared in some 100 films in his 60-year acting career but who is remembered especially chiefly for his monumental, jut-jawed portrayals of Moses, Ben-Hur and Michelangelo, died Saturday night at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was 84.|work=The New York Times|date=April 6, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2008}}</ref>

As a Hollywood star he appeared in 100 films over the course of 60 years. He played the leading role in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956);  ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958) with [[Orson Welles]]; ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] (1959); ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961); and ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968). He also starred in the films ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952); ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1954); ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958); and ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (film)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'' (1965). The starring roles gave the actor a grave, authoritative persona and embodied responsibility, individualism and masculinity; later in his career, he rejected scripts that did not emphasize those virtues. His media image as a spokesman for [[Judeo-Christian]] moral values enabled his political voice.<ref>Emilie Raymond, ''From My Cold, Dead Hands: Charlton Heston and American Politics'', (2006), pp 4–5, 33<!-- publishing info; ISBN needed --></ref>

A supporter of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians and civil rights in the 1960s, Heston eventually rejected liberalism, becoming a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], founding a conservative political action committee and supporting [[Ronald Reagan]]. Heston's most famous role in politics came as the five-term president of the [[National Rifle Association]] from 1998 to 2003. After being diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], he retired from both acting and being the NRA president in 2003.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/morford/article/Charlton-Heston-s-Last-Sneer-The-NRA-retires-2619608.php Charlton Heston's Last Sneer], SFGate.com, April 30, 2003.</ref>
Heston died on April 5, 2008, aged 84, from complications of Alzheimer's disease and [[pneumonia]].

Heston said in a 1995 interview that he was not very good at remembering addresses or his early childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://charltonhestonworld.homestead.com/ChuckInterviews.html|title=Appreciation: Charlton Heston's Interview, Articles, & Tribute|accessdate=March 18, 2010|last=Schultz|first=Rick|year=1995}}</ref> Heston was partially of Scottish descent, including from the [[Clan Fraser]], but the majority of his ancestry was English.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood legend Charlton Heston was proud of Scots roots|date=April 7, 2008|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-news/2008/04/07/hollywood-legend-charlton-heston-was-proud-of-scots-roots-86908-20375323|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

In his autobiography, Heston refers to his father participating in his family's construction business. When Heston was an infant, his father's work moved the family to [[St. Helen, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/Article_View.cfm?ArticleID=1037&NewspaperID=0 My Bay City article, February 5, 2006].</ref> It was a rural, heavily forested part of the state, and Heston lived an isolated yet idyllic existence spending much time hunting and fishing in the backwoods of the area.<ref name="Arena"/>

Throughout Heston's life he was known by friends as "Chuck" although his wife always called him "Charlie." His stage name Charlton Heston is drawn from his mother's maiden surname (Charlton) and his stepfather's surname (Heston),<ref>{{Citation|last=Raymond|first=Emile|year=2006|title=From My Cold, Dead Hands: Charlton Heston and American Politics|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|page=321|isbn=0813171490|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> and was used for his first film, an adaptation of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Staff|title=AFI Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iijusBRcwv4C&pg=PA323&dq=heston+peer+gynt+1941&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1_GJVI7MG8agNrfrgtgK&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=heston%20peer%20gynt%201941&f=false|publisher=University of California Press|page=323|date=1999|isbn=0520215214|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

==Career==
Heston frequently recounted that while growing up in northern [[Michigan]] in a sparsely populated area, he often wandered in the forest, "acting" out the characters from books he had read.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=319357 Private Screenings: Charlton Heston (1998)]. Tcm.com. Retrieved on November 14, 2011.</ref> Later, in high school, Heston enrolled in New Trier's drama program, playing in the amateur silent [[16 mm film]] adaptation of ''Peer Gynt'', from the [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] [[Peer Gynt|play]], by future film activist [[David Bradley (director)|David Bradley]] released in 1941.<ref name="imdb">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000032/bio IMDB.com]; accessed December 11, 2014.</ref>

From the Winnetka Community Theatre (or the Winnetka Dramatist's Guild, as it was then known) in which he was active, he earned a drama scholarship to [[Northwestern University]]; among his acting teachers was [[Alvina Krause]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Northwestern (magazine)|accessdate=December 2, 2013|title=New Theater Honors Alvina Krause |date=Spring 2010|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/spring2010/campuslife/krausestudio.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=December 15, 2004|title=Ms. Alvina Krause|first=James|last=Goode|accessdate=December 2, 2013|url=http://library.bloomu.edu/Archives/SC/BTE/alvinakrause.htm|publisher=[[Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania]]}} Please see also {{URL|http://www.bte.org/alvina-krause}}</ref> Several years later Heston teamed up with Bradley to produce the first sound version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', in which Heston played [[Mark Antony]].

===World War II service===
In 1944, Heston enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. He served for two years as a [[radio operator]] and [[Air gunner|aerial gunner]] aboard a [[B-25 Mitchell]] stationed in the [[Alaska]]n [[Aleutian Islands]] with the [[77th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[Eleventh Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.covnews.com/archives/47708|title=During World War II, Hollywood got serious|publisher=Covnews.com|date=2013-12-10|accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/heston-tribute-to-airmen-1243279.html|title=Heston tribute to airmen|publisher=The Independent|date=1997-08-02|accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> He reached the rank of [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]].

Heston married [[Northwestern University]] student [[Lydia Clarke|Lydia Marie Clarke]] in the same year he joined the military. After his rise to fame, Heston narrated for highly [[classified information|classified]] military and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] instructional films, particularly relating to [[nuclear weapons]], and "for six years Heston [held] the nation's highest security clearance" or [[Q clearance]]." The Q clearance is similar to a [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] or [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) clearance of [[Security clearance#Top Secret|Top Secret]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Top Secret|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/security-clearance|accessdate=August 18, 2011|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]}}</ref>

===Theater and television===
After the war, Heston and Clarke lived in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], New York City, where they worked as artists' models. Seeking a way to make it in theater, Heston and his wife Lydia decided to manage a playhouse in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] in 1947, making $100 a week. In 1948, they returned to New York where Heston was offered a supporting role in a Broadway revival of Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', starring [[Katharine Cornell]]. In television, Heston played a number of roles in CBS's ''[[Studio One (anthology series)|Studio One]]'', one of the most popular anthology dramas of the 1950s. Film producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' spotted Heston in a 1950 television production of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and offered him a contract. When his wife reminded Heston they had decided to pursue theater and television, he replied, "Well, maybe just for one film to see what it's like." {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Heston turned down the lead opposite [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' to appear in [[Benn W. Levy]]'s play ''The Tumbler'', directed by [[Sir Laurence Olivier]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovin|first=Jeff|title=The Films of Charlton Heston|year=1977|publisher=Lyle Stuart|location=New York|isbn=978-0806505619|page=224}}</ref>  Called a "harrowingly pretentious verse drama' by [[Time Magazine]],<ref>{{cite news|title=The Theater: New Plays on Broadway, Mar. 7, 1960|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894730,00.html#ixzz2bV2R26xx|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=March 7, 1960}}</ref> the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tumbler|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=2099|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play to work with him as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, "I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise. I think I've ended up a better actor."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hyams|first=Joe|title=Heston Not Hurt By Flop Play|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19600303&id=xggwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_gAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7322,6153850|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=Toldeo Blade|date=March 3, 1960}}</ref>

Heston enjoyed acting on stage, believing it revivified him as an actor. He never returned to Broadway, but acted in regional theaters. His most frequent stage roles included the title role in ''[[Macbeth]]'', Sir [[Thomas More]] in ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'', and [[Mark Antony]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.<!-- This is unclear. Please include when, where and for who he played these roles -->{{citation needed||reason=when, where, for whom?|date=December 2013}}

Heston played More in several regional productions in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it in [[London's West End]]. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to [[Aberdeen, Scotland]], for a week where it was staged at [[His Majesty's Theatre]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Heston's first professional movie appearance was, at age 27, the leading role in ''[[Dark City (1950 film)|Dark City]]'', a 1950 [[film noir]]. His breakthrough came when [[Cecil B. DeMille]] cast him as a circus manager in ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which was named by the Motion Picture Academy as the best picture of 1952. In 1953, Heston was [[Billy Wilder]]'s first choice to play Sefton in ''[[Stalag 17]]''. However, the role was given to [[William Holden]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] for it. In 1954, he played the lead in ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'', which was shot on location at the archeological site [[Macchu Picchu]] and had numerous similarities to ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which was filmed a quarter century later, including a tomb scene with the revelatory shaft of light pointing out a clue on a map, and Heston's roguish antiquities thief's costume and light beard; the latter film's costume designer [[Deborah Nadoolman Landis]] noted that it was "almost a shot for shot ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''."<ref>{{cite news|author=Mike French & Gilles Verschuere|title=Debora Nadoolman interview|publisher=TheRaider.net|date=September 14, 2005|url=http://www.theraider.net/features/interviews/deborah_nadoolman.php | accessdate=April 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140327132541/http://www.theraider.net/features/interviews/deborah_nadoolman.php|archivedate=March 27, 2014}}</ref> Heston became an icon for portraying [[Moses]] in the hugely successful film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|''The Ten Commandments'']]'' (1956), selected by director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] who reportedly thought Heston bore an uncanny resemblance to [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Moses (Michelangelo)|statue of Moses]]. In 1955, Heston appeared with [[Jane Wyman]] in ''[[Lucy Gallant]]''. In 1958, he played a Mexican police officer, Ramon Miguel Vargas, in [[Orson Welles]]'s widely acclaimed film noir ''[[Touch of Evil]]''. He also starred in William Wyler's ''[[The Big Country]]'' opposite [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Burl Ives]].  After [[Marlon Brando]], [[Burt Lancaster]], and [[Rock Hudson]]<ref name="bobthomas"/> turned down the title role in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|''Ben-Hur'']]'' (1959), Heston accepted the role, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], one of the unprecedented eleven Oscars the film earned. After Moses and ''Ben-Hur'', Heston became more identified with Biblical epics than any other actor. He voiced the role of Ben-Hur in a cartoon version of the [[Lew Wallace]] [[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|novel]] in 2003.<ref name="imdb"/>

[[File:Charlton Heston - 1961 hearing.jpg|thumb|left|Heston at a congressional hearing in 1961]]
Heston played leading roles in a number of fictional and historical epics: ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961), ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' (1963), as [[Michelangelo]] in ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (film)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'' (1965), and ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'' (1966). Heston also played the eponymous role in the western movie ''[[Will Penny]]'' (1968).

From 1965–71, Heston served as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The Guild had been created in 1933 for the benefit of actors, who had different interests than the producers and directors who controlled the [[Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences]]. Heston was more conservative than most actors, and publicly clashed with the outspoken liberal actor [[Ed Asner]].<ref>Emilie Raymond, "The Agony and the Ecstasy: Charlton Heston and the Screen Actors Guild", ''Journal of Policy History,'' (2005) 17#2, pp 217–39<!--ISBN/ISSN needed--></ref>

In 1968, Heston starred in ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and in 1970, he had a smaller supporting role in the sequel, ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]''. Also in 1970, Heston portrayed [[Mark Antony]] again in another film version of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (1970 film)|Julius Caesar]]''. His co-stars included [[Jason Robards]] as Brutus, [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Octavius, [[Robert Vaughn]] as Casca, and English actors [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Cassius, [[John Gielgud]] as Caesar, and [[Diana Rigg]] as Portia.<ref name="imdb"/>

In 1971, he starred in the science fiction film, ''[[The Omega Man]]''. Although critically panned, the film is now considered a classic of post-apocalyptic horror. In 1972, Heston made his directorial debut and starred as Mark Antony in an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play he had performed earlier in his theater career, ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (1972 film)|Antony and Cleopatra]]''. [[Hildegarde Neil]] was Cleopatra and English actor [[Eric Porter]] was Enobarbus. After receiving scathing reviews, the film was never released to theaters, and is rarely seen on television. It was finally released on DVD in March 2011.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H0M31I Antony & Cleopatra: Movies & TV]. Amazon.com. Retrieved on November 14, 2011.</ref> He subsequently starred in more successful films such as ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973) and ''[[Earthquake (film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974).<ref name="imdb"/>

[[File:Heston,1960.jpg|thumb|240px|Heston poses for his wife Lydia at their hilltop [[Beverly Hills]] home, just after winning an Oscar for his role in ''Ben-Hur'', 1960.]]
Beginning with playing [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in 1973's ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'', Heston was seen in an increasing number of supporting roles, cameos and live theater. From 1985-87, he starred in his only prime time stint on a television series in the soap, ''[[The Colbys]]''.<ref name="imdb"/> With his son Fraser, he produced and starred in several TV movies, including remakes of ''[[Treasure Island (1990 film)|Treasure Island]]'' and ''A Man For All Seasons''. In 1992, Heston appeared on the A&E cable network in a short series of videos, ''Charlton Heston Presents the Bible'', reading passages from the [[Authorized Version|King James Version]].<ref name="imdb"/>

Never taking himself too seriously, he also made a few appearances as "Chuck" in [[Dame Edna Everage]]'s shows, both on stage and on television. Heston appeared in 1993 in a cameo role in ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', in a scene where Wayne Campbell ([[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]) requests casting a better actor for a small role. After the scene is reshot with Heston, Campbell weeps in awe. That same year, Heston hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He had cameos in the films ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'', ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''. He starred in many theatre productions at the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], where he appeared in ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]] and [[The Caine Mutiny Court Martial]],'' and as [[Sherlock Holmes]] in ''[[The Crucifer of Blood]]'' opposite Richard Johnson as  [[Dr. Watson]]. In 2001, he made a cameo appearance as an elderly, dying chimpanzee in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|remake of ''Planet of the Apes'']]. Heston's last film role was as the infamous Nazi doctor [[Josef Mengele]] in ''My Father, Rua Alguem 5555'', which had limited release (mainly to festivals) in 2003.<ref>''Variety'', February 12, 2004.<!--page(s) needed--></ref>

Heston's distinctive voice had also landed him roles as a film narrator, including ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''.

Heston played the title role in ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'' three times and cited it as one of his favorite roles. In the early 1990s, he tried unsuccessfully to revive and direct the show with [[Tom Selleck]] in the title role.<ref>Heston, Charlton: ''In The Arena'', Simon & Schuster, 1995, p. 479; ISBN 0-684-80394-1.</ref>

In 1995, Heston starred with [[Peter Graves]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Deborah Winters]] in the [[Warren Chaney]] [[docudrama]] ''[[America: A Call to Greatness]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1838449 ''America: A Call to Greatness''], imdb.com; accessed December 11, 2014.</ref> In 1998, Heston had a cameo role playing himself in the American television series ''[[Friends]]'', in the episode "The One with Joey's Dirty Day".

Heston's political activism had four stages.<ref>Raymond, ''From My Cold, Dead Hands,'' pp 5–7</ref> In the first stage, 1955 to 1961, he endorsed Democratic candidates for President, and signed on to petitions and [[American liberalism|liberal]] political causes. From 1961 to 1972, the second stage, he continued to endorse Democratic candidates for [[POTUS|President]]. From 1965 to 1971, he served as the elected president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], and clashed with his liberal rival [[Ed Asner]]. Moving beyond Hollywood, he became nationally visible in 1963 in support of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and in 1968 used his "cowboy" persona to publicize [[gun control]] measures.  The third stage began in 1972. Like many [[neoconservative]]s of the same era who moved from liberal Democrat to conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he rejected the liberalism of [[George McGovern]] and supported [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972 for President. In the 1980s, he gave strong support to his friend [[Ronald Reagan]] during his [[American conservatism|conservative]] presidency. In 1995, Heston entered his fourth stage by establishing his own political action fund-raising committee, and jumped into the internal politics of the [[National Rifle Association]]. He gave numerous [[culture war]]s speeches and interviews upholding the conservative position, blaming media and academia for imposing [[affirmative action]], which he saw as unfair [[reverse discrimination]].<ref>Steven J.

In the 1964 election, he endorsed [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]], who had masterminded the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] through Congress over the vociferous opposition of [[Southern Democrats]]. That year, Heston publicly opposed [[California Proposition 14 (1964)|California Proposition 14]] that rolled back the state's fair housing law, the  [[Rumford Fair Housing Act]]. In his 1995 autobiography, ''In the Arena'', written after he became a conservative Republican, Heston claimed that on a drive back from the set of ''[[The War Lord]]'', he saw a "[[Barry Goldwater]] for President" billboard with his campaign slogan "In Your Heart You Know He's Right" and thought to himself, "Son of a bitch, he ''is'' right."<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven J.|title=Hollywood Left and Right:How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|location=New York|isbn=978-0195181722|page=288}}</ref>

By the 1980s, Heston supported gun rights and changed his political affiliation from Democrat to Republican. When asked why he changed political alliances, Heston replied "I didn't change.

At a [[Time Warner]] stockholders' meeting, Heston castigated the company for releasing an [[Ice-T]] album which included a song "Cop Killer" about killing police officers. While filming ''[[The Savage]]'', Heston was initiated by blood into the [[Miniconjou]] [[Lakota people|Lakota Nation]], but claimed no natural [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] heritage. He claimed to be "Native American" to salvage the term from exclusively referring to American Indians.<ref name="Arena"/>

In 1993, Heston teamed up with [[John Anthony West]] and [[Robert M. Schoch]] in an [[Emmy Award]] winning [[NBC]] special, ''[[The Mystery of the Sphinx]]''. The documentary proposed a much earlier date for the construction of the [[Great Sphinx]] than originally suggested. Heston, when hosting the documentary, suggested that the main type of [[weathering]] evident on the [[Great Sphinx]] and surrounding enclosure walls could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive [[rainfall]], and the whole structure was carved out of [[limestone]] bedrock by an ancient advanced culture (such as the [[Heavy Neolithic]] [[Qaraoun culture]]).<ref name="Schoch (1992)">Schoch, Robert M.

Dowell; retrieved {{Nowrap|December 17}} 2008.</ref>

In a 1997 speech called ''Fighting the Culture War in America'', Heston rhetorically deplored a [[culture war]] he said was being conducted by a generation of media people, educators, entertainers, and politicians against:<blockquote>...the God fearing, law-abiding, Caucasian, middle-class [[Protestant]] – or even worse, [[evangelical Christian]], Midwestern or Southern – or even worse, rural, apparently straight – or even worse, admitted heterosexuals, gun-owning – or even worse, NRA-card-carrying, average working stiff – or even worse, male working stiff – because, not only don’t you count, you are a down-right obstacle to social progress. Your voice deserves a lower decibel level, your opinion is less enlightened, your media access is insignificant; and frankly, mister, you need to wake up, wise up, and learn a little something from your new America; and until you do, would you mind shutting up?<ref>[[s:Fighting the Culture War in America]]</ref></blockquote>

He went on to say:<blockquote>The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was handed down to guide us by a bunch of wise old dead white guys who invented our country! Now some flinch when I say that. Why! It's true-they were white guys! So were most of the guys that died in [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s name opposing slavery in the 1860s. So why should I be ashamed of white guys? Why is "Hispanic Pride" or "Black Pride" a good thing, while "[[White Pride]]" conjures shaven heads and white hoods? Why was the [[Million Man March]] on Washington celebrated by many as progress, while the [[Promise Keepers]] March on Washington was greeted with suspicion and ridicule? I'll tell you why: Cultural warfare!</blockquote>

In an address to students at [[Harvard Law School]] entitled ''Winning the Cultural War'', Heston said, "If Americans believed in political correctness, we'd still be [[George III of England|King George]]'s boys – subjects bound to the British crown."<ref name="Winning the Cultural War">Heston, Charlton. [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/charltonhestonculturalwar.htm ''Winning the Cultural War''], americanrhetoric.com, February 16, 1999.</ref>

He said to the students:
[[File:Ronald Reagan Charlton Heston.jpg|thumb|right|Heston with President [[Ronald Reagan]] during a meeting for the Presidential Task Force on the Arts and Humanities in the White House Cabinet Room, 1981]]
<blockquote>You are the best and the brightest. You, here in this fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River. You are the cream. But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge. And as long as you validate that and abide it, you are, by your grandfathers' standards, cowards.<ref name="Winning the Cultural War"/></blockquote>

Heston later stated, "Political correctness is tyranny with manners."<ref>{{IMDb name|0000032}}</ref> In a speech to the National Press Club in 1997, Heston said, "Now, I doubt any of you would prefer a rolled up newspaper as a weapon against a dictator or a criminal intruder."<ref>Gold, Dudley Susan.

Heston was the president (a largely ceremonial position) and spokesman of the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] from 1998 until he resigned in 2003. At the 2000 NRA convention, he raised a rifle over his head and declared that a potential [[Al Gore]] administration would take away his [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights "[[from my cold, dead hands]]".<ref>Raymond, ''From My Cold, Dead Hands'',  pp 5–7, 241, 257</ref><ref>''Variety'', June 13, 2000: "Gore fires back after Heston tirade".</ref> In announcing his resignation in 2003, he again raised a rifle over his head, repeating the five famous words of his 2000 speech.<ref name="nation">{{cite news|title=Heston to Step down as NRA President|work=[[The Nation]]|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%5CNation%5Carchive%5C200304%5CNAT20030425f.html|author=Johnson, Jeff|date=April 25, 2003}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> Heston was an honorary life member. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the 2002 film ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', [[Michael Moore]] interviewed Heston at Heston's home, asking him about an April 1999 meeting the NRA held in [[Denver, Colorado]] shortly after the [[Columbine high school massacre]]. Moore criticized Heston for the perceived thoughtlessness in the timing and location of the meeting. When Moore asked Heston for his thoughts on why gun-related homicide is so much higher in the United States than in other countries, Heston said it was because "we have probably more mixed ethnicity".<ref>{{cite news|last=Boyar|first=Jay|title=Heston's remarks bring buzz to Moore's documentary|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-09-09/news/0209080050_1_charlton-heston-moore-toronto|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=September 9, 2002}}</ref> Heston subsequently, on-camera, excused himself and walked away.

Heston opposed [[abortion]] and did the introduction to [[Bernard Nathanson]]'s 1987 [[pro-life]] documentary, ''[[Eclipse of Reason]]'', which focuses on late-term abortions.
