==Series== 
In addition addition to its regular sections and featured articles, ''Moment'' occasionally runs series of articles on a specific topic. These articles are published in a few consecutive issues of the magazine. 

===Democracy in Retreat===

This series explores how democracy is declining in ostensibly democratic countries. Through highlighting one country at a time, this series aims to provide insight into the ways in which elected governments do not always hold democratic values. This series has included articles on Ukraine, Hungary and Turkey. 

===Israel's Arab Citizens===
Beginning in ''Moment''{{'}}s September/October 2009 issue, the special series "Israel's Arab Citizens" has examined aspects of the social, economic, and cultural life of the 1.5 million Arab citizens of the [[State of Israel]]. The first installment, written by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and [[Associated Press]] reporter Dina Kraft, profiled three generations of Arab Israeli women, titled "From Arab to Palestinian Israeli: One Family's Changing Identity".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The second, "Separate But Not Equal", which appeared in the September/October 2010 issue, examined the performance of Arab Israeli children in segregated public schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} "Separate But Not Equal" tied for first place in the Best Investigative News category of the Ethnic Media Awards, sponsored by the [[American University]] School of Communication and [[New America Media]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Crowe |first=Adell |url=http://www.american.edu/soc/SOC-Co-Hosts-Enthnic-Media-Awards.cfm |title=SOC Co-Hosts Ethnic Media Awards &#124; American University School of Communication |publisher=American.edu |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azmuslimvoice.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=766:muslim-media-honored-in-nations-capital&catid=24:politics&Itemid=28 |title=Muslim Media Honored in Nation’s Capital |publisher=Azmuslimvoice.info |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>

Editor and executive publisher Nadine Epstein wrote of her motivation for initiating the series and the importance of focusing attention on the Arab Israelis in a letter from the editor: 
<blockquote>Our lack of knowledge has serious consequences: I regularly meet Jews and non-Jews who view Israel's Arab citizens as, at best, suspect and at worst, terrorists. The reality is that this is a largely peaceful population—very few have been associated with terrorism—with a complex identity. They speak Hebrew, sometimes even better than Arabic, and many vote in Israeli elections. They support a Palestinian state, but their lives are in Israel and most have no intention or desire to leave. At the same time, they are often considered collaborators by some of their Arab brethren.<ref>{{Wayback|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2009/10/200910-Editor.html|title=Letter from the Editor, Nadine Epstein, September/October 2009|date=20120325125241}}</ref></blockquote>
