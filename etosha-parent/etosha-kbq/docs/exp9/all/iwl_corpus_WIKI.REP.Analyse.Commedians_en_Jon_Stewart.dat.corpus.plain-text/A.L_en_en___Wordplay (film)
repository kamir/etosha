'''''Wordplay''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Patrick Creadon]].  It features [[Will Shortz]], the editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'' [[crossword puzzle]], crossword constructor [[Merl Reagle]], and many other noted crossword solvers and constructors.  The second half of the movie is set at the 2005 [[American Crossword Puzzle Tournament]] (ACPT), where the top solvers compete for a prize of $4000.

The movie focuses on the following crossword solvers:
*Ellen Ripstein: [[Editing|editor]] living in [[New York City]] and 2001 ACPT champion. She is also known for her [[Baton (twirling)|baton twirling]].
*[[Trip Payne]]: professional puzzlemaker living in [[South Florida]] and three-time ACPT Champion. He held the record as the youngest champion after winning the tournament in 1993 at the age of 24.
*[[Tyler Hinman]]: student at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]]. At the 2005 ACPT, he challenged Trip Payne for the title of youngest champion ever.

*[[Jon Delfin]]: [[pianist]] living in New York City and seven-time ACPT champion.
*Al Sanders: project manager at [[Hewlett-Packard]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He is a frequent finalist at the ACPT.

The movie contains appearances by many celebrity fans of the ''Times'' puzzle, including [[Bill Clinton]], [[Bob Dole]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Mike Mussina]], [[Daniel Okrent]], and the [[Indigo Girls]].

A 2008 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]", is based on the film.  [[James L. Brooks]] got the inspiration for the episode after watching ''Wordplay''.  "We felt both Will and Merl were very compelling, off-the-beaten-track personalities [in ''Wordplay''], who would fit into our universe very well," Brooks said.  The episode was written by [[Tim Long]], and directed by [[Nancy Kruse]], and guest starred crossword puzzle creators [[Merl Reagle]] and [[Will Shortz]] as themselves.

''Wordplay'' features a theme song, "Every Word," written and performed by [[Gary Louris]] of [[Jayhawks (band)|The Jayhawks]]. The Wordplay DVD features a music video of "Every Word."
