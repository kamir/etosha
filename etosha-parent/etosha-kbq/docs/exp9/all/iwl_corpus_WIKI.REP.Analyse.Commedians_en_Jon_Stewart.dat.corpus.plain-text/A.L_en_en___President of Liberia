{{Politics of Liberia}}

The '''President of the Republic of Liberia''' is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government|government]] of [[Liberia]]. The president serves as the leader of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] and as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of Liberia]].

Prior to the independence of Liberia in 1847, executive power in the Commonwealth of Liberia was held by the [[Agents and Governors of Liberia|Governor of Liberia]], who was appointed by the [[American Colonization Society]]. The [[Liberian Constitution of 1847|1847 Constitution]] transferred the executive powers of the governorship to the presidency, which was largely modeled on the [[President of the United States|presidency of the United States]].

Between 1847 and 1980, the presidency was exclusively held by [[Americo-Liberian]]s, the original American settlers of Liberia and their descendants. The original [[two-party system]], with the [[Republican Party (Liberia)|Republican Party]] and the [[True Whig Party]], ended in 1878, when the election of [[Anthony W. Gardiner]] marked the beginning of 102 years of [[One-party state|single-party rule]] by the True Whigs. Following a ''coup d'état'' by disgruntled army officers led by [[Samuel Doe]] in 1980, the presidency was vacated until the election of Doe in the [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 general election]]. After the overthrow of Doe in 1990, the presidency was again vacated for seven years during the [[First Liberian Civil War]] and again for two years following the conclusion of the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] in 2003.

Under the [[Constitution of Liberia|1986 Constitution]], the president is [[Direct election|directly elected]] by eligible voters to a six-year term, which may be renewed once. Overall, 22 individuals have served as president. On January 16, 2006, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] was sworn in as the twenty-fourth and current president, making her the first elected female president in Africa.

==History==
Following the establishment of the Commonwealth of Liberia in 1838, executive power was vested in the Governor of Liberia, who was appointed and served at the pleasure of the [[American Colonization Society]]. The first governor, [[Thomas Buchanan (Governor of Liberia)|Thomas Buchanan]], served from 1838 until his death in 1841. He was succeeded by [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], the first black governor of Liberia. 

Upon independence in 1847, Roberts was elected as the first president of Liberia. The 1847 Constitution denied [[suffrage]] to the indigenous population by requiring voters to own real estate. As a result, the presidency was exclusively held by [[Americo-Liberian]]s until 1980, when a military coup led by [[Samuel Doe]], an ethnic [[Krahn]], overthrew and assassinated President [[William Tolbert]].

The presidency was vacant from 1980 to 1986, with executive power held by Doe as the head of the [[People's Redemption Council]]. Doe was later elected president in the [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 general election]], making him the first president outside of the Americo-Liberian elite. Doe was later overthrown and executed in 1990 following the commencement of the [[First Liberian Civil War]], during which the presidency remained vacant. 

Following the [[Liberian general election, 1997|1997 general election]], [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] held the presidency until his resignation on August 11, 2003 as part of a peace deal to end the [[Second Liberian Civil War]]. His successor, [[Moses Blah]], ceded executive power on October 13 of that year to [[Gyude Bryant]], the Chairman of the National Transitional Government of Liberia. The presidency was resumed on January 16, 2006 following the [[Liberian general election, 2005|2005 election]] of [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] as the first female president.

==Powers and Duties==
The presidency of Liberia is largely modeled on the [[presidency of the United States]].

===Executive functions===
The 1986 Constitution gives the president the power to appoint all [[cabinet minister]]s, judges, ambassadors, [[sheriff]]s, [[Counties of Liberia|county official]]s and [[military officer]]s with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]]. Additionally, the president has the power to dismiss all appointees from office at his or her discretion. The president may also grant [[pardon]]s or revoke sentences and fines. The president conducts all matters of foreign policy, though any treaties or international agreements must be ratified by both houses of the [[Legislature of Liberia|Legislature]]. Furthermore, the president serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia.

The Constitution also grants the president the power to declare a [[state of emergency]] during times of war or [[civil unrest]] and suspend [[civil liberties]] during the emergency as necessary, with the exception of [[habeas corpus]]. Within seven days of the declaration, the president must state to the Legislature the reasons for the declaration, which both houses must then approve by a two-thirds majority. Otherwise, the president must repeal the state of emergency.

===Legislative functions===
The president must sign all legislation passed by the [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]] and Senate. The president may choose to veto any legislation, which may be overturned by a two-thirds majority in both houses. Additionally, the president may exercise a [[pocket veto]] by refusing to sign legislation when the end of the twenty-day deadline for signing the bill falls during a recess of the legislature. The president may extend a legislative session past its adjournment date or call a special [[extraordinary session]] when he or she deems it necessary in the national interest. The president must also give an annual report to the Legislature on the state of the country.

==Eligibility==
To be eligible for office under the current Constitution, a presidential candidate must:
*be a natural born citizen of Liberia;
*be at least thirty-five years old;
*own real property valued at least $25,000;
*have resided in Liberia for at least ten years.

Additionally, the president may not reside in the same [[Counties of Liberia|county]] as the [[Vice President of Liberia]].

==Term and election==
Under the original 1847 Constitution, the president was elected to a two-year term, which was increased to four years on May 7, 1907.<ref name=starr>{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Frederick|title=Liberia: Description, History, Problems|location=Chicago|year=1913|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KjwUAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=history+Liberia+monrovia&cad=0|page=256}}</ref> Under this amendment, a new president would serve for eight years and could be re-elected to [[term limits|unlimited]] four-year terms.  During the presidency of [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.]], the Constitution was amended to restrict the president to a single eight-year term; by 1976, voices in the Legislature were being raised in favor of returning to the previous system, but Tolbert proclaimed his support for the existing system and vowed to veto any constitutional amendments to remove term limits.<ref>"Pres. Tolbert Says 'No' To Evil Tradition: Vows to Veto Any Amendment To Keep Him In Office".  <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Monrovia]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> ''Sunday Express'' 1976-03-21: 1/2.</ref>

Currently, the president is elected by popular vote to a six-year term and is limited to two terms. Under the 1986 Constitution, presidential elections utilize a [[two-round system]], wherein a [[run-off election|second round of voting]] is held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes if no single candidate obtains a majority in the first round. Each term begins and ends on the first January 16 after presidential elections are held. At the time of their inauguration, each president is required under the Constitution to take a [[Oath of office|presidential oath]] promising to preserve and defend the Constitution and faithfully execute the law. The oath is administered by the [[Chief Justice of Liberia]] in front of a [[joint session]] of the Legislature.
