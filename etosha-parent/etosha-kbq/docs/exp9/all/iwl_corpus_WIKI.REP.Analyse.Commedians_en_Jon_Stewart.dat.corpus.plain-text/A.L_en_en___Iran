==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Iran}}
The name of [[Iran (word)|Iran]] is the [[Modern Persian]] derivative from the [[Proto-Iranian]] term ''Aryānā,'' meaning "Land of the [[Aryan]]s", first attested in [[Zoroastrianism]]'s [[Avesta]] tradition.<ref name="hinduwebsite">{{cite web|author=V.Jayaram |url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/arya.asp |title=The Concepts of Hinduism – Arya |publisher=Hinduwebsite.com |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="wiscper">{{cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20060221034145/http://imp.lss.wisc.edu/~aoliai/languagepage/iranianlanguages.htm |title=Iranian Languages |pages=26–7 |publisher=LSS.wis.edu |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="about.com">{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/persianempiremaps/qt/Iran.htm |title="Iran – The Ancient Name of Iran", N.S.

Historically Iran has been referred to as "Persia" or similar (''La Perse, Persien, Perzië, etc.'') by the Western world, mainly due to the writings of Greek historians who called Iran ''Persis'' (Περσίς), meaning land of the [[Persian people|Persians]]. As the most extensive and close interaction the [[Ancient Greeks]] ever had with any outsider was that with the Persians, the term became coined forever, even long after the Persian rule in [[Ancient Greece]] and beyond had ended and other dynasties were now ruling the regions. In 1935, [[Reza Shah]] requested that the international community refer to the country as Iran. As the [[New York Times]] explained at the time, "At the suggestion of the Persian Legation in [[Berlin]], the Tehran government, on the Persian New Year, [[Nowruz]], March 21, 1935, substituted Iran for Persia as the official name of the country. Defenders of the name change, point to its use by the Greek historians citing that "Aryan" means "noble". In truth during the rise and fall of the Persian Empire the land was known to its people as 'Aryanam', which is equated to the current “Iran” in the proto-Iranian language. During the reign of the Sassanids it became Eran – meaning "land of the Aryans".<ref>[http://www.persiansarenotarabs.com/page/renaming_persia/renaming_persia.html Renaming Persia - What’s in a name?]</ref> Opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision, as also the work of Professor [[Ehsan Yarshater]], editor of [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], [[Columbia University]], who propagated a move to use Persia and Iran interchangeably, which was approved by Mohammad Reza Shah.<ref>{{cite web| title = Renaming Persia| work = persiansarenotarabs.com | year = 2007| url = http://www.persiansarenotarabs.com/renaming-persia/ | accessdate =26 April 2011}}</ref> Today both "Persia" and "Iran" are used interchangeably in cultural contexts; however, "Iran" is the name used officially in political contexts.<ref name="artarena">{{cite web|url=http://www.art-arena.com/history.html |title=Persia or Iran, a brief history |publisher=Art-arena.com |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref>

In 334&nbsp;BC, [[Alexander the Great]] invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid Emperor [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Issus]] in 333&nbsp;BC.

The cultural revival that began in the [[Abbasid]] period led to a resurfacing of [[Iranian nationalism|Iranian national identity]], and so earlier attempts of [[Arabization]] never succeeded in Iran.

At the start of the 1500s, [[Shah Ismail I]] established the Safavid Dynasty in western Persia and Azerbaijan.<ref name=thePersians/> He subsequently extended his authority over all of Persia, and established intermittent Persian hegemony over vast nearby regions which would last for many centuries onwards.

The Safavid era also saw the start of the creation of new layers in Persian society, composed of hundreds of thousands of ethnic [[Georgians]], [[Circassians]], [[Armenians]], and other [[peoples of the Caucasus]]. Following a slow decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s by internal strife, royal intrigues, continuous wars between them and their Ottoman arch rivals, and foreign interference (most notably by the Russians) the Safavid dynasty was ended by [[Hotaki dynasty|Pashtun rebels]] who besieged [[Isfahan]] and defeated [[Soltan Hosein]] in 1722.

In 1729, an Iranian Khorasan chieftain and military genius, [[Nader Shah]], successfully drove out, then conquered the Pashtun invaders.

During Nader Shah's reign, Iran reached its greatest extent since the [[Sassanian Empire]], reestablishing Persian hegemony over all of the [[Caucasus]], other major parts of [[West Asia]], [[Central Asia]] and parts of [[South Asia]], and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire in the world.<ref name="books.google.nl"/>

In 1738-39, he [[Sack of Delhi|invaded India and sacked Delhi]], bringing great loot back to Persia. Nader Shah's assassination sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which [[Karim Khan]] came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.<ref name=Immortal/>

Another civil war ensued after Karim Khan's death in 1779, out of which [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Aga Muhammad Khan]] emerged victorious, founding the [[Qajar|Qajar Dynasty]] in 1794. In 1795, following the disobedience of their [[Georgians|Georgian]] subjects and their alliance with the [[Russians]], the Qajars [[Battle of Krtsanisi|sacked and ravaged Tblisi]], and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing Persian [[suzerainty]] over the region. However reestablishment of Persian control was short-lived, and the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]] and the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)]] resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Persia but substantial gains for the [[Russian Empire]] which took over the [[Caucasus]] (modern [[Dagestan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) from Iran as a result of the treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]].<ref>Farrokh, Kaveh.

Whilst resisting efforts to be colonised, Iran lost lands in the 1800s as a result of Russian and British empire-building, known as '[[The Great Game]]', losing much of its territory in the [[Russo-Persian Wars|Russo-Persian]] and the [[Anglo-Persian War]]s. A series of protests took place in response to the sale of [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] to foreigners by [[Nasser al-Din Shah]] and [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah]] between 1872 and 1905, the last of which resulted in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] and establishment of Iran's first [[majles|national parliament]] in 1906, which was abolished in 1908. The struggle continued until 1911, when Mohammad Ali was defeated and forced to abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911. During [[World War I]], the British occupied much of western Iran, not fully withdrawing until 1921.

He became enormously popular in Iran after he [[nationalize]]d [[Petroleum industry in Iran|Iran's petroleum industry]] and oil reserves. He was deposed in the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]], an Anglo-American covert operation that marked the first time the US had overthrown a foreign government during the [[Cold War]].<ref name="Kinzer2011">{{cite book|author=Stephen Kinzer|title=All the Shah's Men|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pNz-3o_GQwsC&pg=PT10|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=1 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-14440-4|page=10}}</ref>

After the coup, the Shah became increasingly [[autocracy|autocratic]] and [[Sultanism|Sultanistic]]. Arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, [[SAVAK]], were used to crush all forms of political opposition. [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] became an active critic of the Shah's [[White Revolution]] and publicly denounced the government. Khomeini was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964, Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government. The Shah sent him into exile. He went first to Turkey, then to Iraq and finally to France.

Due to the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 spike in oil prices]] Iran’s economy was flooded with foreign currency which caused [[inflation]]. By 1974 Iran’s economy was experiencing double digit inflation and despite many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused [[Background and causes of the Iranian Revolution#1970–1975|large amounts of waste]]. By 1975 and 1976 an [[economic recession]] led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of young men who had migrated to Iran’s cities looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s. By 1977 many of these men opposed the shah’s regime and began to organize and join protests against it.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyLUeiTRF7o Conversations with History: U.S. Iran and Saudi Arabia with Andrew Scott Cooper]</ref>

[[File:Damavand3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Damavand]], Iran's highest point, is located in [[Amol County]], [[Mazanderan]].]]
Iran consists of the [[Iranian Plateau]] with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and [[Khuzestan Province]]. It is one of the world's most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged [[mountain range]]s that separate various [[drainage basin|basins]] or [[plateau]]x from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]] and [[Alborz]] Mountains; the last contains Iran's highest point, [[Mount Damavand]] at {{convert|5610|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which is also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the [[Hindu Kush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624014628/http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html|archivedate=24 June 2011|title=SurfWax: News, Reviews and Articles On Hindu Kush|publisher=News.surfwax.com| accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>

The northern part of Iran is covered by dense rain forests called [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests|Shomal]] or the Jungles of Iran.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The eastern part consists mostly of [[desert]] basins such as the [[Dasht-e Kavir]], Iran's largest desert, in the north-central portion of the country, and the [[Dasht-e Lut]], in the east, as well as some [[salt lake]]s. This is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain clouds to reach these regions.

The only large [[plain]]s are found along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, where Iran borders the mouth of the [[Shatt al-Arab|Arvand river]]. Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and the Gulf of Oman.

The city contains a wide variety of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural]] sites ranging from the 11th to the 19th century.

The fourth major city of Iran is [[Tabriz]] (population 1,378,935), the capital of the [[East Azerbaijan Province]]. It is also the second industrial city of Iran after Tehran. Tabriz had been the second largest city in Iran until the late 1960s and one of its former capitals and residence of the crown prince under the [[Qajar dynasty]]. The city has proven extremely influential in the country’s recent history.

The fifth major city is [[Karaj]] (population 1,377,450), located in [[Alborz Province]] and situated 20&nbsp;km west of Tehran, at the foot of the [[Alborz]] mountains; however, the city is increasingly becoming an extension of metropolitan Tehran.

The sixth major Iranian city is [[Shiraz]] (population 1,214,808); it is the capital of [[Fars Province]]. The [[Elamite]] civilization to the west greatly influenced the area, which soon came to be known as [[Persis]]. The ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] were present in the region from about the 9th century BC, and became rulers of a large empire under the Achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century BC. The ruins of [[Persepolis]] and [[Pasargadae]], two of the four capitals of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], are located in or near Shiraz. Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire and is situated {{convert|70|km|mi}} northeast of modern Shiraz.

Often, Iran's foreign relations since the time of the revolution have been portrayed as being based on two strategic principles: eliminating outside influences in the region and pursuing extensive diplomatic contacts with developing and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned countries]],<ref>Iran Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments, ISBN 1-4387-7462-1, page 141</ref> although the quote it is based upon was actually a call for Islamic Shiite domination, in [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini's]] own words:

Since 2005, [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]] has become the subject of contention with the international community following earlier quotes of Iranian leadership favoring the use of an atomic bomb against Iran's enemies and in particular Israel.<ref>Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani: Israel is a 'one bomb nation'.

This has led the [[UN Security Council]] to impose [[sanctions against Iran]] which had further isolated Iran politically, economically and socially from the rest of the global community.

In 2004, a large share of [[natural gas reserves in Iran]] were untapped. The addition of new [[hydroelectric]] stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants, and the first [[Solar power|solar]] thermal plant is to come online in 2009.

[[Demographics of Iran|Demographic]] trends and intensified industrialization have caused [[electric power]] demand to grow by 8% per year. The government’s goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line [[List of power stations in Iran|new gas-fired plants]] and by adding hydroelectric, and nuclear power generating capacity.

[[File:Astrolabe-Persian-18C.jpg|upright|thumb|An 18th century Persian [[astrolabe]]]]
[[Education in Iran]] is highly centralized. [[K-12 education]] is supervised by the [[Ministry of Education (Iran)|Ministry of Education]], and higher education is under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology|Ministry of Science and Technology]]. The adult literacy rate in 2008 was 85.0%, up from 36.5% in 1976.<ref name=unescolit>{{cite web|title=National adult literacy rates (15+), youth literacy rates (15–24) and elderly literacy rates (65+)|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=210|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref>

The requirement to enter into higher education is to have a [[high school diploma]] and pass the national university entrance examination, [[Iranian University Entrance Exam]] (known as ''concour''), which is the equivalent of the US [[SAT]] exams. Many students do a 1-2 year course of [[University-preparatory school|pre-university]] (''piš-dānešgah''), which is the equivalent of [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[A-levels]] and [[International Baccalaureate]]. The completion of the pre-university course earns students the Pre-University Certificate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabiancampus.com/studyiniran/edusys.htm|title=Study in Iran :: Iran Educational System|author=Peter Krol|work=arabiancampus.com}}</ref> Iran is the only country in the Middle East with a high school course equivalent to the A-levels, SAT and International Baccalaureate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Higher education is sanctioned by different levels of diplomas. ''Kārdāni'' ([[associate degree]]; also known as ''fowq e diplom'') is delivered after 2 years of higher education; ''kāršenāsi'' ([[bachelor's degree]]; also known as ''licāns'') is delivered after 4 years of higher education; and ''kāršenāsi e aršad'' ([[master's degree]]) is delivered after 2 more years of study, after which another exam allows the candidate to pursue a doctoral program ([[PhD]]; known as ''doctorā'').<ref name="wes.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/iran/firedov.htm |title=WEP-Iran |publisher=Wes.org |accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref>

The majority of the population speaks the Persian language, which is also the [[official language]] of the country. Others include the rest of the [[Iranian language]]s belonging to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages]], and the languages of the other ethnicities in Iran.

In southwestern and southern Iran, the [[Luri language|Luri]] and [[Lari language|Lari]] languages are spoken. In [[Kurdistan Province]] and nearby areas, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is widely spoken. In [[Khuzestan]], [[Persian dialects in Khuzestan|many distinct Persian dialects]] are spoken. 

[[Turkic languages]] and dialects, most importantly the [[Azerbaijani language]], are spoken in different areas in Iran. [[Khuzestani Arabic|Arabic]] is also spoken by the [[Ahwazi Arabs|Arabs of Khuzestan]].

Notable minority languages in Iran include [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]]. [[Circassian language|Circassian]] was also once widely used by the large Circassian minority, but, due to assimilation over the many years, no sizable number of Circassians speak the language anymore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-iv--2 |title=Georgia viii: Georgian communities in Persia |last1=Oberling |first1=Pierre |date=7 February 2012 |website=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html |title=Circassian |publisher=Official Circassian Association |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |title=Persians: Kind, hospitable, tolerant flattering cheats? |first1=Sir John |last1=Chardin |authorlink=Jean Chardin |date=June 1997 |journal=[[Iranian.com|The Iranian]] |accessdate=9 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970620173929/http://www.iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |archivedate=20 June 1997 |deadurl=no}} Excerpted from:

===Ethnic groups===
{{main|Ethnicities in Iran}}
[[File:Iran ethnoreligious distribution 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Iran's ethnoreligious distribution]]
[[The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]] has estimated that around 79% of the population of Iran are a diverse [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic group]] that comprise the speakers of the [[Iranian languages]],<ref>J. Harmatta in "History of Civilizations of Central Asia", Chapter 14, ''The Emergence of Indo-Iranians: The Indo-Iranian Languages'', ed. by A. H. Dani & V.N. Masson, 1999, p. 357</ref> with [[Persian people|Persians]] constituting 61% of the population, [[Kurds]] 10%, [[Lurs]] 6%, and [[Baloch people|Balochs]] 2%. Peoples of the other ethnicities in Iran make up the remaining 21%, with [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] constituting 16%, [[Arabs]] 2%, [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] 2%, and others 1% (such as [[Armenians]], [[Georgians]], [[Circassians]], and [[Assyrians]]).<ref name="CIA"/> It found Persian to be the first language of 53% of the population, Azeri and other Turkic dialects being spoken by 18%, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] by 10%, [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] and [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]] by 7%, [[Luri dialects|Luri]] by 6%, [[Balochi language|Balochi]] by 2%, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by 2%, and other languages at 2%.<ref name="CIA"/>

The [[Library of Congress]] issued slightly different estimates: Persians 65%, [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] 16%, [[Kurds]] 7%, [[Lurs]] 6%, [[Baloch people|Baluchi]] 2%; Turkic tribal groups such as [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] 1%, and [[Turkmens]] 1%; and non-Iranian, non-Turkic groups such as [[Armenians]], [[Georgians]], [[Assyrians]], [[Circassians]], and [[Arabs]] less than 3%. It determined that Persian is the first language of at least 65% of the country's population and is the second language for most of the remaining 35%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Iran.pdf |title=Country Profile: Iran |publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=May 2008 |page=5 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref>

Historically, [[Zoroastrianism]] was the dominant religion in Iran, particularly during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires. This changed after the fall of the Sassanid Empire by the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Conquest of Iran]], when Zoroastrianism was gradually replaced with Islam.

Zoroastrians are the oldest religious community of the nation, with a long history continuing up to the present day.

[[Judaism]] also has a long history in Iran, dating back to the [[Nabonidus#The Persian conquest of Babylonia|Achaemenid Conquest of Babylonia]].

Persian culture has long been a predominant culture of the region, with Persian considered the language of intellectuals during much of the 2nd millennium, and the language of religion and the populace before that.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Sassanid era was an important and influential historical period in Iran as Iranian culture influenced China, India and Roman civilization considerably,<ref>{{cite book|author=John Bagnell Bury|title=History of the Later Roman Empire: From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian|volume=1|year=1958|publisher=DOVER PUBN Incorporated|isbn=978-0-486-20398-0|page=109}}</ref> and so influenced as far as Western Europe and Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transoxiana.com.ar/0104/sasanians.html |title=Sassanids in Africa |publisher=Transoxiana.com.ar |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>

===Art===
{{Main|Iranian art|Persian carpet}}
[[File:Isfahan Lotfollah mosque ceiling symmetric.jpg|thumb|Ceiling of the [[Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan]]]]
Iranian art has one of the richest [[art]] heritages in world history and encompasses many disciplines including [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[calligraphy]], [[metalworking]] and [[stonemasonry]]. There is also a very vibrant [[Iranian modern and contemporary art]] scene. The modern [[art movement]] in Iran had its genesis in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The 1949 opening of the ''Apadana gallery'' in [[Tehran]] by Mahmoud Javadipour and other colleagues, and the emergence of artists like [[Marcos Grigorian]] in the 1950s, signaled a commitment to the creation of a form of modern art grounded in Iran.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_91/ai_97551434]</ref>

[[Carpet]]-[[weaving]] is undoubtedly one of the most distinguished manifestations of Persian culture and art, and dates back to ancient Persia and the [[Bronze Age]]. Iran is the world's largest producer and exporter of handmade carpets, producing three quarters of the world's total output and having a share of 30% of world's export markets.<ref>http://www.kohanjournal.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=229&Itemid=54</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Khalaj |first=Mehrnosh |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5a5c0444-1669-11df-bf44-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss |title=Iran’s oldest craft left behind |publisher=FT.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Iranian architecture|Persian gardens}}
According to Persian historian and archaeologist [[Arthur Upham Pope|Arthur Pope]], the supreme Iranian art, in the proper meaning of the word, has always been its architecture. The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre-and post-Islamic periods.<ref>[[Arthur Pope]], ''Introducing Persian Architecture''. [[Oxford University Press]]. London. 1971.</ref> The history of architecture of Iran goes back to the seventh millennium BC.

Iranian architecture generally displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic, developing gradually and coherently out of earlier traditions and experience. Without sudden innovations, and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks, it has achieved "an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries".<ref>[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. [[George Braziller]], [[New York]], 1965. p.266</ref> Its paramount virtues are several: "a marked feeling for form and scale; structural inventiveness, especially in [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[gonbad|dome]] construction; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture".<ref>[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.266</ref>

Persians were among the first to use [[mathematics]], [[geometry]], and [[astronomy]] in architecture and also have extraordinary skills in making massive domes which can be seen frequently in the structure of bazaars and mosques. This greatly inspired the architecture of Iran's neighbors as well. The main building types of classical [[Iranian architecture]] are the mosque and the [[palace]]. Besides being home to a large number of art houses and galleries, Iran also holds one of the [[Iranian Crown Jewels|largest and most valuable jewel collections]] in the world.
Iran ranks seventh among countries in the world with the most archeological architectural ruins and attractions from antiquity as recognized by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20101124090123/http://www1.american.edu/ted/iran-tour.htm |title=Virtual Conference |publisher=American.edu |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> Fifteen of UNESCO's [[World Heritage Site]]s are creations of Iranian architecture.

Persian literature is one of the world's oldest literatures. It dates back to the poetry of [[Avesta]], about 1000 years BC.
These poems which were a part of the oral traditions of ancient Iran, were orally transferred, and later created parts of the Avesta’s book during the Sassanid era.
Its sources have been within historical Persia where the Persian language has historically been the national language.

Persian literature inspired [[Goethe]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and many others, and it has been often dubbed as a most worthy language to serve as a conduit for poetry. Dialects of Persian are sporadically spoken throughout the region from China to Syria to Russia, though mainly in the [[Iranian Plateau]].<ref>Arthur John Arberry, ''The Legacy of Persia'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953, ISBN 0-19-821905-9, p. 200.</ref><ref>Von David Levinson; Karen Christensen, ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons. 2002 p. 48</ref>

Poetry is used in many Persian classical works, whether from literature, science, or metaphysics. [[Persian literature]] has been considered by such thinkers as Goethe as one of the four main bodies of world literature.<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Levinson|author2=Karen Christensen|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Asia: Iaido to Malay|year=2002|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-80617-4|page=48}}</ref>

The Persian language has produced a number of famous poets; however, only a few poets as [[Rumi]] and [[Omar Khayyám]] have surfaced among western popular readership, even though the likes of [[Hafez]], [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]],<ref>{{cite book|author=François de Blois|title=Persian Literature: A Bio-bibliographical Survey|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F-lH8aQ9-HsC&pg=363|accessdate=21 June 2013|volume=5|date=April 2004|publisher=Routledge|quote=Nizami Ganja’i, whose personal name was Ilyas, is the most celebrated native poet of the Persians after Firdausi.|isbn=978-0-947593-47-6|page=363}}</ref> [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]], [[Sanai]], [[Nasir Khusraw]] and [[Jami]] are considered by many Iranians to be just as influential.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}
[[Image:Farvahar001.JPG|thumb|left|alt=The Farohar Symbol from Persepolis|The [[Farvahar|Fravarti]] symbol in [[Persepolis]]]]
Iranian philosophy can be traced back as far as to [[Iranian languages|Old Iranian]] philosophical traditions and thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. According to the [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]], the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through [[Judaism]], and therefore on [[Middle Platonism]]."

Throughout [[History of Iran|Iranian history]] and due to remarkable political and social changes such as [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|the Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions, to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools.

Iranian philosophy after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

===Mythology===
{{Main|Iranian mythology|Iranian folklore}}
Persian [[mythology]] are traditional [[Iranian folklore|tales]] and stories of ancient origin, all involving extraordinary or supernatural beings. Drawn from the legendary past of Iran, they reflect the attitudes of the society to which they first belonged - attitudes towards the confrontation of [[good and evil]], the actions of the gods, ''yazats'' (lesser gods), and the exploits of heroes and fabulous creatures.

[[File:Naqshe Rostam 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Naqsh-e Rustam|Rustam Inscription]]]]
[[Myths]] play a crucial part in [[Iranian culture]] and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the context of [[Iranian history]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
For this purpose we must ignore modern political boundaries and look at historical developments in the [[Greater Iran]], a vast area covering the [[Caucasus]], and Central [[Asia]], beyond the frontiers of present-day Iran. The [[geography]] of this region, with its high mountain ranges, plays a significant role in many of the mythological stories. The 2nd millennium BC is usually regarded as the age of migration because of the emergence in western Iran of a new form of [[Iranian art#Pottery and ceramics|Iranian pottery]], similar to earlier wares of north-eastern Iran, suggesting the arrival of the [[Ancient Iranian peoples]]. This pottery, light grey to black in colour, appeared around 1400 BC. It is called Early Grey Ware or Iron I, the latter name indicating the beginning of the [[Iron Age]] in this area.<ref>Sarkhosh-Curtis, V., ''Persian Myths'' (1993) London, ISBN 0-7141-2082-0</ref>

The central collection of Persian mythology is the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]], written over a thousand years ago. Ferdowsi's work draws heavily, with attribution, on the stories and characters of [[Zoroastrianism|Mazdaism and Zoroastrianism]], not only from the ''[[Avesta]]'', but from later texts such as the ''[[Bundahishn]]'' and the ''[[Denkard]]'' as well as many others.

===Theater===
{{Main|Persian theater|Persian dance}}
[[File:Shahrtheater.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tehran City Theater]]]]
Theater background in Persia goes back to antiquity (641–1000 [[Before Christ|BC]]).

The first initiation of theater and phenomena of acting in people of the land could be traced in the ceremonial theaters which were performed to glorify the heroes and humiliate the enemies, like ''Soug e Sivash'' or ''Mogh Koshi'' (''Megakhouni''), and also dances and theater narrations, and the musical history of mythological and love stories reported by [[Herodotos]] and [[Xenophon]].

There were many [[drama]]tic performance arts popular before the advent of cinema in Persia. A few examples include ''Kheyme Shab Bazi'' ([[Puppetry]]), ''Saye Bazi'' ([[Shadow play]]), ''Rouhozi'' (Comical acts) and ''[[Tazieh]]'' (Martyr plays).

[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam o Sohrab]] is an example of the opera performances in the modern day Iran.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Iran}}
[[File:Harp-Sassanid.png|thumb|left|[[Taq-e Bostan|Taq e Bostan]] carving, from 6th century [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Iran]].]]
Iranian music, as evidenced by the archeological records of [[Elam]] in southwestern Iran, dates back thousands of years. In ancient Iran musicians held socially respectable positions. The [[Elamite]]s and the [[Achaemenid]]s certainly made use of musicians.

The history of the [[Sassanid music|musical performance in Sassanid Iran]] is, however, better documented than earlier periods. This is specially more evident in the context of Zoroastrian ritual.<ref name=EI-mhphi>{{harv|Lawergren|2009}} iv. First millennium C.E. (1) Sasanian music, 224–651.</ref> By the time of Xusro Parviz the Sassanid royal court was the host of prominent musicians such as Ramtin, [[Bamshad]], [[Nakisa]], Azad, [[Sarkash]], and [[Barbad]].

Like most of the world’s cultures, the music of Persia has depended on oral transmission and learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-xi-persian-music |title=Iran: Music |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref>

Persian symphonic music has a long history. In fact [[Opera]] originated from Persia, much before its emergence in Europe. Iranians traditionally performed ''[[Tazieh]]'', which in many respects resembles the European Opera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2005/10/051005_az-tehransymphony-orchestra.shtml|title=Iranian performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Iran's main orchestra include [[Iran's National Orchestra|National Orchestra]], [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Melal Orchestra|Nations Orchestra]].

Today the musical culture of Persia, while distinct, is closely related to other musical systems of the West and Central Asia. It has also affinities to the music cultures of the Indian subcontinent, to a certain degree even to those of Africa, and in the period after 1850 particularly, to that of Europe. Its history can be traced to some extent through these relationships.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Some Iranian traditional music instruments include [[Tar]], [[Dotar]], [[Setar]], [[Kamanche]], [[Harp]], [[Oud|Barbat]], [[Santur (Persian instrument)|Santur]], [[Tanbur]], [[Qanun (instrument)|Qanun]], [[Daf|Dap]], [[Dhol]], [[Tonbak|Tompak]] ([[Goblet drum]]), and [[Ney]].

===Cinema and animation===
{{Main|Cinema of Iran|History of Iranian animation}}
[[File:Kiarostami-1940.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Abbas Kiarostami]], a well-known Iranian director, at the [[Venice Film Festival]]]]
The earliest examples of visual representations in Iranian history may be traced back to the [[bas-relief]]s in [[Persepolis]] (c. 500 BC). Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of [[Achaemenids]] and the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.<ref>Honour, Hugh and John Fleming, ''The Visual Arts: A History''. New Jersey, Prentice Hall Inc, 1992. Page: 96.</ref> During the [[Sasanian]] reign, Iranian visual arts reached a pinnacle. A bas-relief from this period in [[Taq Bostan|Taq e Bostan]] depicts a complex hunting scene. Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see a progenitor of the cinema close-up in one of these works of art, which shows a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground.<ref name="horschamp1">{{cite web|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/preiran.html|title=Iranian Cinema: Before the Revolution|work=horschamp.qc.ca}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, five-year-old industry of cinema came to Iran. The first Iranian filmmaker was [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi|Mirza Ebrahim Khan (Akkas Bashi)]], the official photographer of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar al Din Shah]] of [[Qajar]]. He obtained a camera and filmed the Shah's visit to Europe, upon the Shah's orders.

In 1904, [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi|Mirza Ebrahim Khan (Sahhaf Bashi)]] opened the first movie theater in Tehran.<ref name="massoudmehrabi1">{{cite web|url=http://www.massoudmehrabi.com/articles.asp?id=1414606616|title=Massoud Mehrabi - Articles|work=massoudmehrabi.com}}</ref> After him, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.<ref name="horschamp1"/>

The first silent Iranian film was made by Professor [[Ovanes Ohanian]] in 1930, and the first sounded one, ''[[Lor Girl]]'', was made by [[Abdolhossein Sepanta|Abd ol Hossein Sepanta]] in 1932.

The 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian cinema, with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early 60s, increasing to 65 by the end of the decade. The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers. With the screening of the films ''[[Qeysar (film)|Kaiser]]'' and ''[[The Cow (film)|The Cow]]'', directed by [[Masoud Kimiai]] and [[Dariush Mehrjui]] respectively in 1969, alternative films established their status in the film industry. Attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the Golrizan Festival, bore fruits in the form of the Sepas Festival in 1969. The endeavors also resulted in the formation of the Tehran World Festival in 1973.

After the Revolution of 1979, as the new government imposed new laws and standards, a new age in Iranian cinema emerged, starting with ''Viva...'' by [[Khosrow Sinai]] and followed by many other Iranian directors who emerged in the last few decades, such as [[Abbas Kiarostami]] and [[Jafar Panahi]]. Kiarostami, who some critics regard as one of the few great directors in the history of Iranian cinema,<ref>[http://www.indiewire.com/people/int_Kiarostam_Abbas_000801.html Kiarostami Will Carry Us; The Iranian Master Gives Hope]</ref> planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'' in 1997. The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals, such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[Venice Film Festival]], and the [[Berlin Film Festival]], attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces.<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.fr/aide/search_film.php?langue=6002&titre_film=&realisateur=&acteur=&anneefilm=&paysfilm=IRN]</ref> In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2006/02/060209_pm-berlin-film-festival.shtml|title=Iran's strong presence in 2006 Berlin Film Festival|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4726682.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Iran films return to Berlin festival|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

[[Asghar Farhadi]], a well-known Iranian director, has received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], and was named as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world by [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] in 2012.

Other well-known Iranian directors include [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]], [[Majid Majidi]], [[Bahram Beyzai]], [[Bahman Ghobadi]], [[Rakhshan Bani-E'temad]], [[Amir Naderi]], [[Ali Hatami]] and [[Reza Mirkarimi]].

[[Marjane Satrapi]], [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]], [[Nazanin Boniadi]], [[Shirin Neshat]], [[Amir Mokri]], [[Bahar Soomekh]], [[Amir Talai]], [[Nasim Pedrad]], [[Daryush Shokof]], and [[Rosie Malek-Yonan]] are among cinema people in the [[Iranian diaspora]].

The oldest records of animation in Iran date back to the late half of 3rd millennium BC. An earthen goblet discovered at the site of the 5,200-year-old [[Burnt City]] in southeastern Iran, depicts what could possibly be the world’s oldest example of animation. The artifact bears five sequential images depicting a [[wild goat|Persian Desert Ibex]] jumping up to eat the leaves of a tree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritagetrust.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/worlds-oldest-animation|title=World’s oldest animation?|work=The Heritage Trust}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/8045|title=Oldest Animation Discovered In Iran|work=Animation Magazine}}</ref>

The art of animation, as practiced in modern day Iran, started in the 1950s. After four decades of animation production in Iran and three-decade experience of [[Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults|Kanoon Institute]], Tehran International Animation Festival (TIAF) was established in February 1999. Every two years, participants from more than 70 countries attend this event which holds the biggest national animation market in Tehran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tehran-animafest.ir/first_fest/about_pg/about_history_first_fest_en.htm|title=Tehran International Animation Festival (1st Festival 1999 )|work=tehran-animafest.ir}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animation-festivals.com/festivals/tehran-international-animation-festival-tiaf|title=Tehran International Animation Festival (TIAF)|work=animation-festivals.com}}</ref>

===Holidays and festivals===

Iran has three official calendar systems, including the [[Solar Hijri calendar|Persian calendar]] as the main and national calendar, the [[Gregorian calendar]] for international events and Christian holidays, and the [[Lunar calendar]] for Islamic holidays.

[[Nowruz]] is the main national holiday of Iran, and is an ancient tradition celebrated on 21 March to mark the beginning of the spring.
It is a secular holiday, enjoyed by people of different faiths; however, it is a holy day for Zoroastrians. It was registered on the list of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=121693&sectionid=351020101 |title=Leaders of regional countries to mark Nowruz |publisher=PressTV |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> and described as the ''Persian New Year''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20100306060954/http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/march_2010/norouz_persian_new_year.aspx|title=Norouz Persian New Year|publisher=British Museum|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://webcitation.org/query.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fspanish%2Faboutun%2Forgans%2Fga%2F55%2Fverbatim%2Fa55pv94e.pdf|title=General Assembly Fifty-fifth session 94th plenary meeting Friday, 9 March 2001, 10 a.m. New York|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|date=9 March 2001|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20100322222922/http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20100317/wl_time/08599197278600|title=Nowrooz, a Persian New Year Celebration, Erupts in Iran – Yahoo!News|publisher=News.yahoo.com|date=16 March 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/19/us-mulls-persian-new-year-outreach-to-iran/|title=US mulls Persian New Year outreach|work=Washington Times|date=19 March 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> by UNESCO in 2009.

Some other national festivals of Iran include:

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Iranian cuisine}}
[[Image:Kookoo-sabzi.jpg|thumb|''[[Kuku (food)|Kuku]] Sabzi'' with herbs, topped with [[barberries]] and [[walnuts]]]]
The cuisine of Iran is diverse, with each province featuring dishes, culinary traditions and styles unique to their region. The main Persian cuisines feature combinations of rice with meat, chicken or fish and some onion, vegetables, nuts, and herbs. Herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plums, pomegranates, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins.

Iranians usually eat plain [[yogurt]] with lunch and dinner; it is a staple of the diet in Iran. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavourings such as saffron, dried limes, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form. Iranian cuisine has greatly inspired its neighbors.

Iran is also famous for its [[caviar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20050716074736/http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2228/html/focus.htm |title=Sturgeon Stocks Slump |publisher=Iran-daily.com |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref>
