The '''White House''' is the [[official residence]] and principal workplace of the [[President of the United States]], located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] It has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800.

The house was designed by Irish-born [[James Hoban]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the White House|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/inside-white-house/history|work=The White House|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref> and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) expanded the building outward, creating two [[colonnade]]s that were meant to conceal stables and storage.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |author=Michael W. Fazio and Patrick A. Snadon |year=2006 |pages=364–366}}</ref> However, in 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829.

Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]] which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. The third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.

The modern-day [[White House Complex]] includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]—the former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice President—and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories—the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The term ''White House'' is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] and for the president's administration and advisers in general, as in "''The White House has decided that...."''. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of "[[America's Favorite Architecture]]".

==Early history==

===1789–1800===
Following his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the [[Samuel Osgood House (New York City)|Samuel Osgood House]] at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789&nbsp;– February 1790), and the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39–41 Broadway (February–August 1790). In May 1790, New York began construction of [[Government House, New York|Government House]] for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790.

The July 1790 [[Residence Act]] named [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the [[Washington, D.C.|Federal City]] was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]'s [[President's House (Philadelphia)|city house]] at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it.

President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On 1 November, in 1800,<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/johnadams</ref> he became the first president to occupy the White House. The [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House in Philadelphia]] became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

The President's House was a major feature of [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's]]'s plan for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20061230082500/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/05/subs/images_print/05_f.pdf|title=Timelines-Architecture|accessdate=2007-11-13|format=PDF|publisher=White House Historical Association|page=1}}</ref><ref>L'Enfant identified himself as "Peter Charles L'Enfant" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ...."] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, "Pierre Charles L'Enfant". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. ISBN 978-0-9727611-0-9). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: "(a) In General.—The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant." The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as "[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]" and as "[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]" on its website.</ref> The architect of the White House was chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] which received nine proposals, including one submitted anonymously by [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Frary, Ihna Thayer |title=They Built the Capitol |year=1969 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=27 |isbn=978-0-8369-5089-2}}</ref>

President Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in May 1791 on his "Southern Tour", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Irish architect [[James Hoban]]. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.<ref>William Seale, "James Hoban: Builder of the White House" in ''White House History'' no. 22 (Spring 2008), pp. 8–12.</ref>

On July 16, 1792, the President met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/04/subs/04_b_1792.html|title=Primary Document Activities |accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher= White House Historical Association}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>

Washington was not entirely pleased with the original submission, however; he found it too small, lacking ornament, and not monumental enough to house the nation's president. On his recommendation, the house was changed from three stories to two, and was widened from a nine-bay facade to an 11-bay facade. Hoban's competition drawings do not survive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Design influences===
The building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc31.htm|title=The White House|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref> Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Château de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by [[Mathurin Salat]]. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812–1817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).<ref name="France?">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecolumnists.com/johnson/johnson103.html|title= Our White House in France?|author=Michael Johnson|work=TheColumnists.Com|date=May 10, 2006|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref> The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[École Spéciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).<ref name="johnson">{{cite journal |title=A chateau fit for a president|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/opinion/15iht-edjohnson.html|author=Johnson, Michael |date=September 15, 2006 |journal=New York Times|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref>  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].<ref name="France?"/>

===Construction===

Construction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Old Georgetown |year=1933 |publisher=Garrett & Massie, Inc. |author=Ecker, Grace Dunlop |page=36}}</ref> The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free African-American laborers, as well as employed Europeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_african-americans-01.html|title=Time line&nbsp;– African-Americans|accessdate=2007-11-13 |publisher= White House Historical Association}}</ref> Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,<ref name="whha overview">{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071116134013/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/02/subs/02_b.html|title=White House Tour Essays: The Overview|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=White House Historical Association}}</ref> as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the "fish scale" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/overview.htm|title=Overview of the White House|accessdate=2007-11-09 |publisher= White House Museum}}</ref>

Shortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a "palace" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.<ref name="whha overview"/> The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone façades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.<ref name="whha overview"/>

As it is a famed structure in America, several [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.

===Architectural description===

The principal façade of the White House, the north front, is of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the façade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].

The mansion's southern façade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the façade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by 5 bays, the windows of which, as on the north façade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the façade.

===Naming conventions===

The building was originally referred to variously as the "President's Palace", "Presidential Mansion", or "President's House".<ref>{{cite book |author=Seale, William |title=The President's House, A History.

==Evolution of the White House==

===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===

On Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.<ref name="whha overview"/> During Adams' second day in the house, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail, containing a prayer for the house. Adams wrote:
{{quote|I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.<ref name="whha state dining room">{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071203002312/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/02/subs/02_b09.html|title=The State Dining Room |accessdate= 2007-11-02|publisher= White House Historical Association}}</ref>}} Franklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.<ref name="whha state dining room"/>

Adams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the "pleasant country residence"<ref>{{cite web|title=Jefferson Describes the White House|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170179|work=Original Manuscripts and Primary Sources|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}</ref> in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big ("big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain"<ref>John Whitcomb, ''Real Life at the White House: 200 Years of Daily Life at America's Most Famous Residence''. Routledge, 2000. ISBN 978-0-415-92320-0. p. 15.</ref>), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.<ref name="whha overview"/> Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.<ref name="whha overview"/>

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops<ref name="whha east room">{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071007081129/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/02/subs/02_b03.html|title=The East Room |accessdate= 2007-11-02|publisher= White House Historical Association}}</ref> during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning [[Upper Canada]]'s [[Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada|Parliament Buildings]] in the [[Battle of York]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,<ref name="whha east room"/> and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=1e2fb507-5704-45d5-a997-f4015c772e7c|title=Treasure hunt or modern-day pirates?|publisher=canada.com|year=2006|accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/british-warship-sunk-during-war-with-us-may-hold-lost-treasures-of-white-house-517123.html |title=British warship sunk during war with US may hold lost treasures of White House |first=David |last= Usborne |date= November 27, 2005|work=The Independent |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young | first= G.F.W | title= HMS ''Fantome'' and the British Raid on Washington August 1814| journal= Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Journal| volume=10 |pages= 132–145 }}</ref>

After the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|The Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.<ref>Haas, Irvin. ''Historic Homes of the American Presidents.'' New York: Dover Publishing, 1991, p. 30.</ref> Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.<ref name="whha overview"/> Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |author=Michael W. Fazio and Patrick A.

Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[Áras an Uachtaráin|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''Áras an Uachtaráin'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.<ref name="wh museum 1825-1872"/> For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.

By the time of the [[American Civil War]], the White House had become overcrowded. The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.<ref name="epstein">{{cite journal |title=The East and West Wings of the White House |author=Epstein, Ellen Robinson |date=1971–1972 |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society}}</ref> Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns.

The [[Panic of 1873]] had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The [[Statue of Liberty]] project was not the only undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the [[Washington Monument]] sometimes stalled for years.<ref>Khan, Yasmin Sabina (2010).

When [[Chester Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].<ref name="reeves268">{{cite book | last = Reeves | first = Thomas C. | title = Gentleman Boss | publisher = Alfred A.

In the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell "USA". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.<ref name="reeves269">{{cite book | last = Reeves | first = Thomas C. | title = Gentleman Boss | publisher = Alfred A.

In 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.<ref name="epstein"/> A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.<ref name="epstein"/> These plans were ultimately rejected.

However, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Entrance Hall|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor1/entrance-hall.htm|work=The White House Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt Renovation, 1902|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/special/renovation-1902.htm|publisher=The White House Museum|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref>  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the President's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.<ref name="whha overview"/>

President [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the [[Oval Office]].<ref name="epstein"/>  The West Wing was damaged by fire in 1929, but rebuilt during the remaining years of the [[Herbert Hoover]] presidency. In the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].<ref name="whha overview"/>

President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/whtour/library.html|title=Library Art and Furnishings|accessdate= 2007-11-07|publisher=The White House}}</ref>

===The Kennedy restoration===
[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[Stéphane Boudin]] during the administration of John F. Kennedy]]

[[Jacqueline Kennedy]], wife of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961–63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.<ref name="wh museum kennedy"/> Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family. [[Stéphane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Mrs. Kennedy to assist with the decoration.<ref name="wh museum kennedy"/> Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.<ref name="wh museum kennedy">{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/special/renovation-1961.htm|title=Kennedy Renovation: 1961–1963|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=White House Museum}}</ref> In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]] Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique "Vue de l'Amérique Nord" wall paper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.

The first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Jacqueline+Kennedy+in+the+White+House+Page+3.htm|page=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303180252/http://jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Jacqueline+Kennedy+in+the+White+House+Page+3.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2009|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=John F.

==The White House since the Kennedy restoration==

Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]]—at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates—approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.

In 2013 President Barack Obama installed a set of solar panels on the roof of the White House.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/15/solar-panels-installed-on-white-house-roof/ | work=Fox News | title=Solar panels installed on White House roof | date=August 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/08/solar-panels-finally-installed-on-white-house/ White House Finally Gets Solar Panels - ABC News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The president usually travels to and from the White House grounds via official [[motorcade]] or helicopter. In the 1950s, President [[Dwight D.

===Executive Residence===
{{Main|Executive Residence}}

The original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s—one on the east and one on the west—designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings, added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining.

This portion of the building was used as the setting for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.

===East Wing===
{{Main|East Wing}}

The East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the "Office of the First Lady". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].

===Grounds===

The White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. Although the White House grounds have had many gardeners through their history, the general design, still largely used as master plan today, was designed in 1935 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, under commission from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson. Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2009/03/28/michelle-obama-goes-organic-and-brings-in-the-bees.html |title=Michelle Obama Goes Organic and Brings in the Bees – Washington Whispers |publisher=US News and World REport |date=March 28, 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref>

===Historical accessibility===
Like the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.

The White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like "General" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Aviation incidents===
{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->
In 1974, a stolen Army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House grounds. Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane crashed on the White House grounds, and the pilot died instantly.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/1159300.stm |work=BBC News | title=White House security scares | date=February 7, 2001}}</ref>

As a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.<ref>{{cite news|author= Joe Johns|coauthors=Kelli Arena and Kathleen Koch|title=Intruding pilots released without charges|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/11/evacuation/index.html|publisher=CNN|date= May 12, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===
On May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].

After [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Report of the White House Security Review|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html|publisher=Order of the Secretary of the Treasury|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> During the [[Boston Marathon Bombings]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.

The Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.<ref>{{cite web|title= Statement of Committee of 100 on the Federal City and The National Coalition to Save Our Mall|url=http://www.savethemall.org/other/pa_ave.html|publisher=National Coalition to Save Our Mall, Inc|accessdate=2007-11-08|year=2004}}</ref>

Prior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visiting the White House|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/tours/|publisher=The White House|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].<ref>{{cite news|title=White House tours canceled due to federal budget cuts|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-white-house-tours-cancelled-budget-cuts-20130305,0,5471476.story|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=6 March 2013|first=Kathleen|last=Hennessey|date=March 5, 2013}}</ref> The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=White House Tours To Resume In November (With A Catch)|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-tours-resume-november-catch-1435140|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

===Protection===
The White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].

[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all air space around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grunder.no/magasinet/arkiv/okonomisk-rapport-2006/nr-02/rapport/norske-vapen-vokter-presidenten/ |title=Norske våpen vokter presidenten : Gründer Økonomisk Rapport |publisher=Grunder |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2006/03/13/460587.html |title=Norge sikret innsettelsen av Bush – Nyheter |publisher=Dagbladet |date=March 13, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref>
