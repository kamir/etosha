[[File:Lopez George Cuban cigar.jpg|thumb|right|Lopez in 2007]]
In 2000, after several years of performing stand-up comedy, Lopez was approached by actress [[Sandra Bullock]] for Lopez to produce and star in a comedy. Bullock was concerned about the lack of [[Hispanic]]-oriented sitcoms on American television and pushed to get a sitcom on television that starred Hispanics without being exclusively about the Hispanic American community. Long criticized by Hispanic American groups for lack of Latinos on their television shows, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] quickly picked up the television series. In 2002, Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Freddie Prinze]], and [[John Leguizamo]]. ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' is an American situation comedy that originally aired on ABC from 2002–2007. Lopez is the co-creator, writer, producer, and star of the show.

On March 8, 2007, it was announced that ''George Lopez'' would join the [[Nick at Nite]] lineup. It first aired on Nick at Nite on September 10, 2007. On May 15, 2007, ABC announced that the series would be canceled after its sixth season. The show last aired on ABC September 7, 2007. The show also entered [[television syndication|syndication]] in the fall of 2007. Never a big [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] hit in prime-time, the show became a surprise success in syndication.

Lopez was a cast member and commentator for HBO’s hit sports show ''[[Inside the NFL]]'' for the 2003–2004 football season.

Lopez guest starred as the mayor of [[Reno, Nevada]] in the fifth season of ''[[Reno 911!]]'' in 2008.

On March 28, 2009, it was announced that Lopez would be hosting his own late night talk show on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]].<ref>Kate Ward, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''</ref> Lopez hosted a late-night talk show entitled ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'' on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] Monday through Thursday at midnight [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The show debuted in November 2009. In November 2010, the show moved back to midnight ET to accommodate a new show with former ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' host [[Conan O'Brien]]. Lopez supported and even advocated for the move, making it different from the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict]] that saw O'Brien depart NBC after a proposal to push ''Tonight'' back 30 minutes for [[Jay Leno]] to return to the 11:35&nbsp;p.m. slot.<ref name="conantbs">{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/how-the-conan-obrien-tbs-deal-happened/?src=busln|author=Bill Carter|title=How the Conan O’Brien-TBS Deal Happened|date=April 12, 2010|accessdate=April 12, 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref> On August 10, 2011 Lopez received a cancellation notice from [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]].

In 2005, his wife Ann donated one of her kidneys to Lopez. The transplant was successful; Lopez lost 45&nbsp;lbs after the operation due in part to the improvement in his health.

==Feuds==

===Jay Leno===
Lopez criticized [[Jay Leno]], someone he once considered a "close friend," during an interview on radio station [[WOMX-FM]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] on January 24, 2007, stating, "He's the biggest two-faced dude in TV." He also called him a back-stabber, and said he is not a proficient interviewer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-lopezaudio-012407,0,6385878.mp3file?coll=orl-caltop |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=OrlandoSentinel.com |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-lopezleno-bk,0,5890460.story?coll=orl-home-entlife |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=OrlandoSentinel.com |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>

===Carlos Mencia===

He also claimed he had a physical altercation with Mencía over the alleged appropriation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml|author=Goldyn, Debra|title=Is Carlos Mencia a thief?|work=Advocate|publisher=[[University of Colorado at Denver]]|date=May 2, 2007|accessdate=May 14, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=5264&IssueNum=199|author=Kozlowski, Carl|title=Carlos Mencia Just Said That|publisher=Los Angeles CityBeat|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=July 14, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070920201944/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=5264&IssueNum=199 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 20, 2007}}</ref>

===Erik Estrada===
Lopez frequently mentions his dislike for [[Erik Estrada]]. According to Lopez, he met Estrada when he was a teenager and Estrada was at the zenith of his career. Estrada refused to shake the teenager's hand, and Lopez has disliked him ever since. Lopez related the story while guest-hosting ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'', then saying, "Fuck that ''[[Putazo|puto]]''!" In his comedy special ''America's Mexican'', Lopez uses this story to warn celebrities to always be good to their fans, because they never know who their fans might grow up to be.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===ABC Entertainment===
After receiving the news that his show was cancelled in 2007, Lopez criticized president of [[ABC Entertainment]] Steve McPherson for using racially motivated reasons for his decision. The actor told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that "TV just became really, really white again," and lashed out against ABC by saying, "So a [[chicano]] can't be on TV, but a caveman can?" in reference to the short-lived sitcom ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', which was replacing ''George Lopez'' on the schedule. ''Cavemen'' garnered a sharply negative reception from critics and viewers, and was cancelled after just 13 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title=IT'S A CAVE-IN!
