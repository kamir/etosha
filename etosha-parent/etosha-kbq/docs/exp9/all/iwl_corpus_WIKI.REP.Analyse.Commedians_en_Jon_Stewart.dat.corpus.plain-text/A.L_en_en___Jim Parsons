==Early life and education==
Jim Parsons was born at St. Joseph Hospital in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], and was raised in one of its northern suburbs, [[Spring, Texas|Spring]]. He is the son of Milton Joseph "Mickey/Jack" Parsons, Jr. (February 6, 1949 – April 29, 2001) and teacher Judy Ann (née McKnight). His sister Julie Ann Parsons is also a teacher.<ref name=FatherGrave>{{cite web|last=Yates|first=Gerrie Jones Dickens|title=Milton Joseph Parsons, Jr.|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=5467500|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=September 22, 2005}}</ref><ref name=cogan>{{citation| last=Cogan| first=Jennifer| title=Klein Oak grad takes home Emmy| newspaper=Klein Sun News| date=September 8, 2010| url=http://www.hcnonline.com/articles/2010/09/08/klein_sun/news/090810_parsons_kl2.txt}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name=SaintMary>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintmarylancaster.org/projects/JIM%20PARSONS%20WEBOGRAPHY%20FOR%20LANGUZGE%20ARTS_files/Page317.htm |title=Biography |publisher=Saintmarylancaster.org |date=1974-03-24 |accessdate=2013-08-23}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name=WhoDoYouThink>"Who Do You Think You Are?

Parsons points to a role in ''[[Noises Off]]'' during his junior year as the first time "I fully connected with the role I was playing and started to truly understand what it meant to be honest on stage."<ref name=cogan/> After playing the role of the Kola-Kola bird in a school production of ''[[The Elephant's Child]]'' at age six, Parsons was determined to become an actor.<ref name=cogan/><ref>{{cite news |title=Shocking Jim Parsons truths revealed after Emmy win |author=Christie D'Zurilla |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/08/emmys-jim-parsons.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 29, 2010 |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The young Parsons was heavily influenced by sitcoms, particularly ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', and ''[[The Cosby Show]]''.<ref name=beale>{{citation| last=Beale| first=Lewis| title=TELEVISION Fast chat with Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons: Houston native says he doesn't speak Klingon| newspaper=Houston Chronicle| date=January 18, 2010| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2010_4836155}}</ref>

After graduating from high school, Parsons received an undergraduate degree from the [[University of Houston]]. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in 3 years. He was a founding member of [[Infernal Bridegroom Productions]] and regularly appeared at the [[Stages Repertory Theatre]].<ref name=dansby>{{citation| last=Dansby| first=Andrew| title=Jim Parsons find smart comedy role| date=September 10, 2009| newspaper=Houston Chronicle| page=Zest, p. 8| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2009_4790601}}</ref> Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the [[University of San Diego]] in 1999.<ref name=dansby/> He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the [[Old Globe Theater]]. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, "Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, which is one reason he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater, does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out."<ref name=martinez>{{citation| last=Martinez| first=Olivia| title=Alum sparks big bang at the Emmys| newspaper=The Vista| date=September 16, 2010| url=http://www.theusdvista.com/mobile/news/alum-sparks-big-bang-at-the-emmys-1.1602499| accessdate=September 23, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: "school was so safe!.....you frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things."<ref name=newsweek>{{citation| title=Comic Relief| newspaper=Newsweek| date=September 11, 2009| url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/09/11/comic-relief.html}}</ref> Parsons graduated in 2001<ref name=martinez/> and moved to New York.<ref name=dansby/>

One of his ancestors was the French architect [[Louis-François Trouard]] (1729–1804).<ref name=WhoDoYouThink/>

==Career==
===Early career===
In New York, Parsons worked in [[Off-Broadway]] productions and made several television appearances. In a much-discussed 2003 [[Quiznos]] commercial, Parsons played a man who had been raised by wolves and continued to nurse from his wolf "mother".<ref name=dansby/> He had a recurring role on the television show ''[[Judging Amy]]''<ref name=moore>{{citation| last=Moore| first=Frazier| title=Jim Parsons finds 'Big Bang Theory' stimulating| date=May 24, 2010| url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/life/article_c8dce031-d5b2-5db1-a0e9-de4df0e4893d.html| newspaper=Press of Atlantic City}}</ref> and appeared on the television series ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]''.<ref name=dansby/> Parsons also had minor roles in several movies, including ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' and ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School for Scoundrels]]''.<ref name=keveney>{{citation| last=Keveney| first=Bill| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-12-07-jim-parsons_N.htm| title=Big Bang-up role for Jim Parsons| date=December 8, 2008| newspaper=USAToday}}</ref>

===Breakthrough role in ''The Big Bang Theory''===
[[File:Johnny Galecki & Jim Parsons at Comic Con 2009.jpg|thumb|Parsons and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' co-star [[Johnny Galecki]] at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] in 2009]]
Parsons has estimated that he auditioned for between 15 and 30 television pilots, but on many of the occasions when he was cast, the show failed to find a television network willing to purchase it.<ref name=dansby/> The exception came with ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''. After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of [[Sheldon Cooper]] would be a very good fit for him.<ref name=cogan/> Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers "brilliantly use those words that most of us don't recognize to create that rhythm. And the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue, and in a lot of ways still is."<ref name=beale/>

In his audition, Parsons so impressed series creator [[Chuck Lorre]] that Lorre insisted on a second audition to see if Parsons could replicate the performance. Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends and the waitress who lives across the hall. The role requires Parsons to "rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during the silence that follows."<ref name=dansby/> Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon's lines.<ref name=cogan/>

Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons' physical comedy to that of [[Buster Keaton]] and other silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons' instincts, saying that "You can't teach that."<ref name=dansby/> Lorre describes Parsons' "great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds his hands, cocks his head, the facial tics as "inspired".<ref name=keveney/> Reviewer [[Lewis Beale]] describes Parsons' performance as "so spot-on, it seems as if the character and the actor are the same person." Parsons admits that the work is "more effort than I ever thought a sitcom would take. And that's really the fun of it."<ref name=beale/>

In August 2009, Parsons won the [[Television Critics Association]] award for individual achievement in comedy, beating [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Steve Carell]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]].<ref name=jakle>{{citation| last=Jakle| first=Jeannie| title=Jim Parsons adjusts to his celebrity role: Big Bang star leaps from Klein Oak grad to TV popularity| newspaper=Houston Chronicle| date=August 5, 2009| url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2009_4773419| page=Star, p. 4}}</ref> Parsons was nominated for [[Emmy]] awards in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, winning in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6067913/jim-parsons-emmy-big-bang-theory|title=Jim Parsons wins Emmy for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy|work=Vox}}</ref> In September 2010, Parsons and costars [[Johnny Galecki]] and [[Kaley Cuoco]] signed new contracts, guaranteeing each of them $200,000 per episode for the fourth season of ''The Big Bang Theory'', with substantial raises for each of the next three seasons.
