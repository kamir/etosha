=== Acting career ===
[[File:Adamsandler(cannesPhotocall).jpg|thumb|Sandler at 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Early in his career, Sandler played [[Theo Huxtable]]'s friend, Smitty in ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and a stud boy or Trivia Delinquent in the [[Game show|MTV game show]] ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]''. After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, taking the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "[[The Thanksgiving Song]]" and "[[The Chanukah Song]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.biography.com/people/adam-sandler-9542505|title= Adam Sandler Biography: Film Actor, Singer, Songwriter, Comedian, Screenwriter (1966–)| publisher=Biography.com ([[A&E Networks]])| accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995.<ref name="Sandler fired">{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}</ref>

In 1993, Adam Sandler co-starred in "[[Coneheads]]" with [[Chris Farley]], [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. In 1994, he co-starred in ''[[Airheads]]'' with [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Steve Buscemi]]. He starred in ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995) as a grown, though uneducated, man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect, along with the right to inherit his father's multi-million-dollar hotel empire. In ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies]]'', [[Siskel and Ebert]] gave the film a very bad review, and said of Sandler "...Not an attractive screen presence, he might have a career as a villain or a fall guy or the butt of a joke, but as the protagonist his problem is he creates the fingernails on the blackboard" with Siskel adding "...you don't have a good motivation for the character's behavior".<ref name="sis">{{cite video | url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/2M23ANOA767S/Just-Cause--The-Brady-Bunch-Movie--Billy-Madison--Oscar-Surprises-1995 | title=Just Cause / The Brady Bunch Movie / Billy Madison / Oscar Surprises (1995) | publisher=[[Siskel and Ebert]] | people=[[Gene Siskel]], [[Roger Ebert]] | medium=[[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] | location=[[USA]]}}</ref> He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor party-themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998), but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), one of his first hits.

Although his earliest films did not receive critical praise, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' in 2002. [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of ''Punch-Drunk Love'' concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development.<ref>Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023 "Punch-Drunk Love."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''. October 18, 2002.</ref> Sandler has moved outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious parts such as the aforementioned ''Punch-Drunk Love'' (for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]), ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004) and ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007). He played a loving father figure in ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999). During filming, he met [[Jackie Sandler|Jacqueline Samantha Titone]]—his future wife and mother of his two daughters—who was cast as the waitress from The Blarney Stone Bar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

At one point, Sandler was considered for the part that went to [[Jamie Foxx]] in ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'' (2004). He also was one of the finalists along with [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Johnny Depp]] for the role of [[Willy Wonka]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005).<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://splitsider.com/2012/06/the-lost-roles-of-adam-sandler/|title= The Lost Roles of Adam Sandler |author= Bradford Evans|publisher= [[Splitsider]] |date = June 14, 2012 }}</ref> He returned to more dramatic{{pov-statement|date=December 2011}} fare with [[Mike Binder]]'s ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in [[9/11]] and rekindles a friendship with his old college roommate ([[Don Cheadle]]). He starred with [[Kevin James]] in the film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' (2007), as a New York City fireman pretending to be gay to keep up an insurance scam so that his best friend's children can have benefits. Sandler headlined ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008), a comedy about a [[Mossad]] agent who fakes his own death and moves to the United States to become a hair stylist. The film was written by Sandler, ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' writer-director [[Judd Apatow]] (who was an old roommate of Sandler's when both were starting out), and ''[[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]]'' creator [[Robert Smigel]], and was directed by ''Happy Gilmore'' director [[Dennis Dugan]].

"Like [[Will Ferrell]], Sandler has layers of tenderness under layers of irony under layers of tenderness—plus a floating anger like Jupiter’s great red spot," wrote [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in a review of ''You Don't Mess with the Zohan''. "Some performers become stars because we can read them instantly, others—like Sandler—because we never tire of trying to get a fix on them."<ref>{{cite web |last=Edelstein |first=David |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/47552/ |title=Israeli Stud, Aspiring Hairdresser: Adam Sandler makes his Jewish mother proud.
