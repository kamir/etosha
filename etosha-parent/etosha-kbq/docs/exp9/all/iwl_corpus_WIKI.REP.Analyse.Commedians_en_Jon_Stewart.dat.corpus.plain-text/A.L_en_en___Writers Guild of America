The '''Writers Guild of America''' is a generic term referring to the joint efforts of two different US labor unions:  
* The [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGAE), representing TV and film writers East of the Mississippi.
* The [[Writers Guild of America, West]] (WGAW), representing TV and film writers in Hollywood and Southern California.
==Common activities==
The WGAE and WGAW negotiate contracts in unison as well as launch [[work stoppage]]s simultaneously:
* [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]
** [[Effect of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike on television]], a list of television shows affected by the strike
* [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]]
* 1985 Writers Guild of America strike
* [[1981 Writers Guild of America strike]]
* [[1960 Writers Guild of America strike]]

Although each Guild runs independently, they perform some activities in parallel:
*[[Writers Guild of America Award]], an annual awards show with simultaneous presentations on each coast
*[[WGA screenwriting credit system]], determines how writers' names are listed during the credits
*[[WGA script registration service]], online services to prove when scripts were written and by whom
*[[International Affiliation of Writers Guilds]] (IAWG), an international labor federation both Guilds belong to
