==Writing career==
Prior to Harvard Ian had begun his writing career at Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio.

After graduating from Harvard, Frazier worked briefly as a writer for the [[pornographic magazine]] ''[[Oui Magazine|Oui]]'' in Chicago.<ref>Ian Frazier. ''Family''. p. 351.</ref> The following year, he moved to New York City and joined the staff of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, where he wrote feature articles, humorous sketches, and pieces for "The Talk of the Town" section.

In 1982, Frazier moved to [[Montana]] and, through travel and library research, began collecting materials, anecdotes and impressions that would later become 1989's ''Great Plains''. He returned to the region in the later 1990s to research his book about [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], ''On the Rez''.

In his non-fiction works such as ''Great Plains'', ''Family'', and ''On the Rez'', Frazier combines first-person narrative with in-depth research on topics including [[History of the United States|American history]], Native Americans, fishing, and the outdoors.  Frazier is among the best modern exponents of ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s style of level-headed, matter-of-fact lyricism; an example are these final lines from the 1985 essay "Bear News," reprinted in his 1987 collection ''Nobody Better, Better than Nobody''.<ref>Ian Frazier, ''Nobody Better, Better than Nobody," New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1987. p. 149-50.</ref>
:Beautiful scenery makes its point quickly; then you have to pay attention, or it starts to slide by like a loop of background on a Saturday-morning cartoon... When you see a bear, the spot where you see it becomes instantly different from every place else you've seen. Bears make you pay attention. They keep the mountains from turning into a blur, and they stop your self from bullying you like nothing else in nature. A woods with a bear in it is real to a man walking through it in a way that a woods with no bear is not. Roscoe Black, a man who survived a serious attack by a grizzly in Glacier Park several years ago, described the moment when the bear had him on the ground: "He laid on me for a few seconds, not doing anything...I could feel his heart beating against my heart." The idea of that heart beating someplace just the other side of ours is what makes people read about bears and tell stories about bears and theorize about bears and argue about bears and dream about bears. Bears are one of the places in the world where big mysteries run close to the surface.

''[[The New York Times]]'' critic James Gorman described Frazier's 1996 humor collection ''Coyote v. Acme'' (in the title piece, [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] is suing the manufacturer of various rocket-propelled devices) as the occasion for "irrepressible laughter in the reader." Gorman rates Frazier's first collection, 1986s ''Dating Your Mom'', as "one of the best collections of humor ever published."<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5D81539F930A15755C0A960958260 James Gorman, "Beep-Beep!", The New York Times, June 23, 1996.]</ref>

His February 2012 ''New Yorker'' piece on the Stella d'Oro factory labor strike won [[The Sidney Award]].<ref name="NYer">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/02/06/120206fa_fact_frazier|title=Stella D'oro, Private Equity, and American Factories|last=Frazier|first=Ian|date=February 6, 2012|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>
