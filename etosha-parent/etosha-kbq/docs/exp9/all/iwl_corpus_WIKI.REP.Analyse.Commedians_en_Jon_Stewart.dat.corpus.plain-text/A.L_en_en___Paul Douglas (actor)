He worked originally as an announcer for [[CBS]] radio station [[WCAU]] in that city, relocating to network headquarters in New York in 1934.

He also played [[Richard Widmark]]'s police partner in the [[1950 in film|1950]] thriller ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'', frustrated newlywed Porter Hollingsway in ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949), Sgt.

Douglas was host of the 22nd annual [[Academy Awards]] in March 1950.  Continuing in radio, he was the announcer for ''The [[Ed Wynn]] Show'', and the first host of NBC Radio's ''[[The Horn & Hardart Children's Hour]]''.  In April 1959 Douglas appeared on ''[[The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show]]'' as Lucy Ricardo's television morning show co-host in the episode "Lucy Wants a Career".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007222 IMDB entry]</ref>

Douglas was originally cast in the 1960 episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called "[[The Mighty Casey]]", a role written for him by [[Rod Serling]] based on his character in ''Angels in the Outfield'', but Douglas died the day after production of the episode had been completed.  His role was taken over by [[Jack Warden]], and most of the episode was refilmed several months later.

==Personal life==
In January 1942, Douglas married actress [[Virginia Field]]; Field was 7 months pregnant.  After moving in February 1942, Johnnie Douglas was born on March 2, 1942. Douglas found out that Field was having an affair with [[Dick Powell]], and they separated in December 1945.  They divorced on January 30, 1946, and Douglas returned to California to resume his acting career. After 3½ years of being single, he met [[Jan Sterling]] at MGM Studios and soon they were engaged. They married on June 22, 1950, in [[Palm Springs, California]] and soon moved to [[Burlington, Vermont]], where their daughter, Celia Douglas, was born on August 30, 1954.

==Death==
Paul Douglas died of a heart attack in [[Hollywood, California]] on September 11, 1959, at the age of 52.  Film director [[Billy Wilder]] and his longtime co-writer [[I. A. L. Diamond|I. A. L. ('Izzy') Diamond]] had just offered him the role of Jeff Sheldrake in the [[1960 in film|1960]] movie ''[[The Apartment]]'' that went to [[Fred MacMurray]] instead.  Wilder later said: "I saw him and his wife, Jan Sterling, at a restaurant, and I realized he was perfect, and I asked him right there in the parking lot.  About two days before we were to start, he had a heart attack and died.  Iz and I were shattered."
