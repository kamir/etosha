'''''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver''''' is an American [[late-night talk show|late-night talk]] and [[news satire]] television program airing on Sundays on [[HBO]] in the United States and [[HBO Canada]], and on Mondays (originally Tuesdays) on [[Sky Atlantic]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name="order">{{cite news |last=Patten |first=Dominic |date=February 12, 2014 |title=HBO Sets Name & Date For John Oliver Debut |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/hbo-sets-name-date-for-john-oliver-debut/ |deadurl=no |website=[[Deadline.com]] |publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140214111313/http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/hbo-sets-name-date-for-john-oliver-debut/ |archivedate=February 14, 2014 |accessdate=February 12, 2014 }}</ref> The half-hour-long<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Connell|first=Michael|title=John Oliver's HBO Series Gets Name, April Premiere|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/john-olivers-hbo-series-gets-679764|accessdate=March 10, 2014|publisher=[[hollywoodreporter.com]]|date=February 12, 2014}}</ref> show premiered on Sunday, April 27, 2014, and is hosted by comedian [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]. ''Last Week Tonight'' shares some similarities with [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', where Oliver was previously [[List of The Daily Show correspondents|featured as a correspondent]] and fill-in host, as it takes a satirical look at news, politics and current events on a weekly basis.<ref name="order"/>

Oliver has said that he has full [[Artistic freedom|creative freedom]], including free rein to criticize corporations. His initial contract with HBO was for two years with an option for extension.<ref name="freedom">{{cite web|last=Guthrie |first= Marisa |title= John Oliver on the Luxurious 'Freedom' of HBO, His Complicated Relationship With NYC|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-oliver-luxurious-freedom-hbo-696165|work=The [[Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=19 April 2014|date=16 April 2014}}</ref> In February 2015, it was announced that the show has been renewed for two additional seasons of 35 episodes each.<ref name="time">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3712367/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-renewed |title=Last Week Tonight With John Oliver Gets 2 More Seasons |last=Luckerson |first=Victor |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=February 18, 2015 |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}</ref> Oliver and HBO programming president Michael Lombardo have discussed extending the show from half an hour to a full hour and airing more than once a week after Oliver "gets his feet under him".<ref name="freedom"/>

==Production==
Oliver described his preparations for the show to an interviewer for ''[[The Atlantic#The Wire|The Wire]]'': "... I basically have to watch everything. The only thing I kind of watch for pleasure is [[Fareed Zakaria GPS|Fareed Zakaria's show]] on Sundays... That and ''[[60 Minutes]]'' I watch for pleasure, or maybe ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]''... I have a TV on in my office all the time and I'll generally flick around on that from [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel|Fox]], [[MSNBC]], [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]], [[CNBC]], [[Al Jazeera America|Al Jazeera]]... I'm watching with a certain thing in mind and that is how to see a story told badly."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/05/john-oliver-what-i-read/361405/ |author= Zuckerman, Esther |date= May 1, 2014 |title= John Oliver: What I Read |publisher= ''[[The Atlantic#The Wire|The Wire]]'' |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref>

He admitted to another interviewer that he is concerned about dealing with [[News#Newsworthiness|old news]]: "If something happens on a Monday, realistically all the meat is going to be picked off that bone by the time it gets to us - there's probably barely a point in doing it... I think we'll be attracted to some extent by stories that are off the grid... Our show may end up skewing more international in terms of stories."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unfetteredequality.com/2014/08/13/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-changing-journalism-for-the-better |title=Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Changing journalism for the better |last=Hoxie |first=Angie |date=August 13, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}</ref>

[[Tim Carvell]], executive producer of ''Last Week Tonight'', explained to an interviewer how the cast and crew deal with a half hour of Oliver speaking without any [[Television advertisement|commercial]] breaks.<ref name="usnews">{{cite web |url= http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/04/22/5-things-to-know-about-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver |author= Sneed, Tierney |date= April 22, 2014 |title= Why ''Last Week Tonight'' Will Not Just Be ''The Daily Show'' on Sundays |publisher= ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref> {{Quotation|"Structural considerations are leading to changes in the content in the show that will inherently make it different from ''The Daily Show''... We realized early on, you don't necessarily want to hear anybody talk to you for a half an hour straight – even John, who is very charming – so we are constructing these little, produced comedy elements that will serve the function of commercial breaks throughout the show, which will let us get out of the studio, get us away from John's voice and break the show up a bit."}} Carvell also revealed that HBO gave them freedom in choosing guests for the show, advising them not to feel obligated to feature celebrities.<ref name="usnews" /> 
When asked by an interviewer about "correspondents" such as those featured on ''The Daily Show'', Oliver replied, "we're not going to be a parody news show, so no people pretending to be journalists."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/last-week-tonight-john-oliver-interview-two-days-later-222215388.html |author= |date= |title='Last Week Tonight,' Two Days Later: John Oliver on His First Show, Dream Guests, and Old White Racists  |publisher= |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2015, it was announced that the show has been renewed for two additional seasons of 35 episodes each.<ref name="time" />

==Reception==
Oliver's debut show garnered 1.11 million viewers. The number of viewers online, through websites such as [[YouTube]] showing extended clips of different segments, have steadily climbed into multiple millions. The show's YouTube channel also features Web Exclusives which are occasionally posted when the main show is taking a week off. Across the TV airings, DVR, on-demand and [[HBO Go]], Last Week Tonight averaged 4.1 million weekly viewers in the first season.<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Connell |first= Michael |title=John Oliver's Talk Show Ratings Edging Out HBO Colleague Bill Maher|work= The Hollywood Reporter |date= September 9, 2014 |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-olivers-talk-show-ratings-735187|accessdate= December 23, 2014}}</ref>

Matthew Jacobs of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' named Oliver's program as 2014's best television show writing, "the year's most surprising contribution to television is a show that bucked conventional formats, left us buzzing and paved the way for a burgeoning dynasty. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver is 2014's crowning achievement.<ref>{{cite news |last= Jacobs |first= Matthew |title= Why 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' Was 2014's Best Show |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |date= December 8, 2014 |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/08/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-best-show-2014_n_6284074.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063/ |accessdate= December 9, 2014}}</ref>

[[Hank Stuever]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' compared Oliver's program with ''The Daily Show'' several times in his review of Oliver's debut: <blockquote>"another scathing, stick-it-to-'em critique of American [[mass media]] and politics shellacked in satire and delivered by a funny if almost off-puttingly incredulous man with a British accent... Exactly like ''The Daily Show'', the goal is to make elected and appointed officials, as well as just about any corporate enterprise, look foolish and inept while slyly culling together television news clips that make the media look equally inept at covering such evident truths."<ref>{{cite news |last= Stuever |first= Hank |title= John Oliver's 'Last Week Tonight' on HBO sticks to a familiar formula |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= April 28, 2014 |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2014/04/28/john-olivers-last-week-tonight-on-hbo-sticks-to-a-familiar-formula/ |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' similarly compared ''Last Week'' with ''The Daily Show'', but also wrote that the "full half-hour gives Oliver the room to do more", and praised Oliver's "sharper tone and his globalist, English-outsider perspective", as well as his "genuine passion over his subjects". Poniewozik wrote that Oliver's debut was "a funny, confident start".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://time.com/79133/john-oliver-review-last-week/ |author= Poniewozik, James |date= April 28, 2014 |title= REVIEW: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver |publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref>

The ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' review began by ringing the same changes: "The fear with ''Last Week Tonight'' is that it's ''The Daily Show'' except once a week — a staggered timeline that would rob the basic news-punning format of its intrinsic topical punch... The first episode of his HBO series didn't stray far from the [[Jon Stewart|[Jon] Stewart]] mothership, stylistically..." However, the reviewer, Darren Franich, liked that Oliver has "a half-hour of television that is simultaneously tighter and more ambitious, that the extra production time leads to sharper gags but also the ability to present more context" and thought that the debut had "plenty of funny throwaway lines". Franich appreciated Oliver's coverage of [[Indian general election, 2014|the 2014 India Election]], which the American press was largely ignoring,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.forbes.com/sites/alyssaayres/2014/05/01/thanks-john-oliver-why-india-isnt-a-big-focus-for-u-s-television/ |author= Ayres, Alyssa |date= May 1, 2014 |title= Thanks, John Oliver! Why India Isn't a Big Focus for U.S. Television |publisher= ''[[Forbes]]'' |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref> and, like Poniewozik, praised Oliver's "passion". Franich concluded that ''Last Week Tonight'' "suggested the sharpest possible version of its inspiration" and that it "should feel like an experiment" but "felt almost fully formed".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/04/28/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-review/ |author= Franich, Darren |date= Apr 28, 2014 |title= 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' review: The Weekly Show |publisher= ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref>

The reviewer for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' was ambivalent, writing that the show is "obviously a work in progress" and that one segment "felt like misplaced overkill", but also that it is "good use of a weekly show, and it was funny to boot".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/04/the_premiere_of_john_oliver_s_hbo_show_last_week_tonight_reviewed.html |author= Haglund, David |date= April 2014 |title= Last Week Tonight: Like The Daily Show, With Unbleeped Swears! |publisher= ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' |accessdate= May 4, 2014}}</ref> [[Gawker]]'s Jordan Sargent claimed ''Last Week Tonight'' was "the new ''Daily Show''",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://defamer.gawker.com/john-olivers-last-week-tonight-is-the-new-daily-show-1572116205/all |author=Sargent, Jordan |date=May 6, 2014 |title=John Oliver's Last Week Tonight is the New Daily Show |publisher=''[[Gawker]]'' |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> while simultaneously criticizing the ''Daily Show'' for abandoning those "who have moved on from caring about [[Fox News|Fox [News]]] and [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]]".

A number of commentators from mainstream media outlets, including [[New York Times]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/business/media/john-olivers-complicated-fun-connects-for-hbo.html |title=John Oliver’s Complicated Fun Connects for HBO|date=November 16, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015|last=Carr|first=David|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref> [[The Huffington Post]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/26/john-oliver-journalism_n_5888184.html|title=John Oliver Is Doing Some Really Good Investigative Journalism|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015|last=Bauder|first=David|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''}}</ref> [[Time Magazine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3589285/unfortunately-john-oliver-you-are-a-journalist/ |title=Unfortunately, John Oliver, You Are a Journalist|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''}}</ref> and [[Associated Press]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/with-journalism-in-quiver-john-oliver-transcends-his-schtick-1.1760408|title=With journalism in quiver, John Oliver transcends his schtick|date=September 25, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015|last=Bauder|first=David|publisher=''[[Associated Press]]''}}</ref> have described the style of reporting journalism or even investigative journalism. Oliver himself disagrees, stating that "it’s not journalism, it’s comedy—it’s comedy first, and it’s comedy second."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/29/last-week-tonight-does-real-journalism-no-matter-what-john-oliver-says.html|title=‘Last Week Tonight’ Does Real Journalism, No Matter What John Oliver Says|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=September 29, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

==International reaction==
A segment on [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Tony Abbott]] received widespread attention in [[Australia]] across the mainstream media and was trending on [[social media]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/tony-abbott-lambasted-on-us-tv-show-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/story-e6frfmyi-1226940367958 |author= |date= June 3, 2014 |title= Tony Abbott lambasted on US TV show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver hero |publisher= ''[[News Corp Australia]]'' |accessdate= June 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/554572/20140603/tony-abbot-last-week-tonight-john-oliver.htm#.U4-z_CgkRTY |author= Ma Evelyn Castino Quilas |date= June 3, 2014 |title= Tony Abbott Mocked in U.S. News Program, Aussies Cringe on Twitter |publisher= ''International Business Times'' |accessdate= June 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-roasted-by-john-oliver-on-hbo-show-last-week-tonight-20140602-zrvl1.html |author= Nick Toscano |date= June 2, 2014 |title= Tony Abbott roasted by John Oliver on HBO show Last Week Tonight |publisher= ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' |accessdate= June 5, 2014}}</ref>

According to a document obtained by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', the military government of [[Thailand]] listed Oliver as "[[Lèse majesté in Thailand|undermining the royal institution]]" for calling Crown Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]] a "buffoon" and an "idiot".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/thailands-military-government-thinks-john-oliver-is-a-threat-to-its-monarchy|title=Thailand's Military Government Thinks John Oliver Is a Threat to Its Monarchy|publisher=Vice|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/29/thai-junta-comedian-john-oliver-royal-jibes|title=Thai junta unamused by comedian John Oliver's royal jibes|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 July 2014}}</ref>

The show also made international headlines following Oliver's interview with [[Edward Snowden]], which included a graphic, in-depth conversation about the amount of power [[United States government]] has at its disposal in terms of intelligence, both domestic and foreign. Oliver also confronted Snowden about the lack of knowledge of the American people about his work and why they may be hesitant to analyze it for themselves rather than accept preconceived notions of him being a [[whistleblower]]. Notably, he tried to help Snowden in creating public awareness for the fundamentality of the surveillance problem in putting forward the question "Can they see my dick?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/06/media/edward-snowden-john-oliver-interview/index.html?source=yahoo_quote|title=John Oliver lands Edward Snowden interview from Russia|publisher=''CNNMoney''|date=April 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/06/edward-snowden-john-oliver-last-week-tonight-nsa-leaked-documents|title=John Oliver presses Edward Snowden on whether he read all leaked NSA material|publisher=The Guardian|date=April 6, 2015}}</ref>
