'''Who Made Huckabee?''', also known as '''the Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud''', refers to a mock rivalry that occurred among [[Late night television|late night]] talk show hosts [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Jon Stewart]] in early 2008, reportedly over who was responsible for [[Mike Huckabee presidential campaign, 2008|then]]-[[presidential candidate]] [[Mike Huckabee]]'s success in the presidential [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|primaries]].<ref name="Fox">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/02/06/who-created-huckabee-conan-stewart-and-colbert-fight-it-out/|title=Who Created Huckabee?

In reality, however, the feud was concocted by the three comedians as a result of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name="nyt"/> Without writers to fuel their [[banter]], the three comedians staged a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]/rivalry in order to fill airtime and garner more viewers during the ratings slump.<ref name="msnbc"/>  Stephen Colbert made the claim that because of "the Colbert bump" in popularity which results from guest appearances on his show,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/colbert_bump.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Colbert Bump in Campaign Donations: More Truthful than Truthy |journal=PS: Political Science & Politics |issue=3 |volume=41 |pages=533–539 |date=July 2008 |last=[[Jamesf H.

O'Brien claimed he was responsible for [[cable television|cable]] personality Colbert's success because he mentioned Colbert on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', a [[broadcast network]] show, and by extension was behind the success of Huckabee. In response, Stewart claimed he was responsible for ''O'Brien'''s original success, since Stewart featured him on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' in the early 1990s.

As the feud escalated, O'Brien, Colbert and Stewart each put forward increasingly [[farce|farcical]] reasons he was responsible for Huckabee's success, insulting their rivals in the process. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows on the same night. The feud ended on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' with a tongue-in-cheek "all-out brawl" between the three talk-show hosts.<ref name="msnbc">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/  Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud].

Reaction to the "feud" by both the public and the media was mostly positive. [[TV Squad]]'s Annie Wu beamed: "With the three hosts appearing on each other's shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore. It became a clash of the Titans, a battle of epic proportions, a heaping helping of Monday fanservice."<ref name="tv squad"/>  Even so, the three comedians "shared a certain comedic sensibility",<ref name="msnbc"/> and admitted that they had a good time while helping each other out.

== The feud ==

=== Beginning ===

The [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007–2008 Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike]], which began in November 2007, all but crippled the United States' entertainment industry. Virtually all scripted Hollywood shows were expected to shut down by the week of December 19, 2007.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/03/2080997.htm Hollywood writers' strike could shut down industry], ''ABC News'', November 3, 2007</ref> Hollywood journalist [[Nikki Finke]] reported, "CEOs are determined to write off not just the rest of this TV season (including the Back 9 of scripted series), but also pilot season and the 2008/2009 schedule as well.

Although he is a WGA member who pledged support for the writers, O'Brien announced that following the collapse of negotiations, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' would return to air on January 2, 2008, without writers, citing his non-writing staff facing layoffs as the main reason.<ref name="lenobrien">{{cite news |first=Nikki |last=Finke |title=WGA Reminds Returning Jay And Conan: No Monologues |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/wga-reminds-returning-jay-conan-dont-write-monologues/ | work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}</ref><ref name="threat">{{cite news |first=Nikki |last=Finke |title=WGA Scolds Carson Daly For Returning 'To Support Staff' And Seeking Scab Jokes |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/accusation-carson-daly-seeks-scabs/ |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}</ref> Later, Stewart and Colbert announced that their shows, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', would also return without writers on January 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |last=Finn |first=Natalie |title=''Daily Show'', ''Colbert'' returning |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=aea7d8c1-9d37-4f12-a73e-bf128981ad32 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=December 20, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref> To show respect to the picketing writers, ''The Daily Show'' was renamed, for the duration of the strike, '''''A''''' ''Daily Show with Jon Stewart''.<ref name="Introducing A Daily Show">{{Cite web |title=Introducing A Daily Show |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=147108&title=introducing-a-daily-show}}.

''[[New York Magazine]]'' (January 2008). Retrieved on 2008-07-05.</ref> On January 2, 2008, ''Late Night'' featured a small musical segment at the beginning of the show detailing O'Brien's newly grown beard in a similar show of support for the striking writers.

Huckabee generated a considerable following of young voters during his campaign, primarily because of his support of the [[Fair Tax]] as well as his concerns about [[global warming]], education, and several other issues typically not referred to by Republicans.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1580804/20080201/index.jhtml Mike Huckabee Weighs In on Gay Rights...

Huck's Army, an online grassroots coalition and volunteer [[think tank]], is largely composed of younger, more technologically savvy adherents. So productive was this group that it received national media attention and was credited by Huckabee as "the secret weapon of our campaign".<ref>http://www.hucksarmy.com/</ref>

On January 4, 2008, O'Brien attempted to take responsibility for Huckabee's popularity among young voters by claiming that his show was the sole cause of Huckabee's status in the votes, due to his use of "The ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' [[List of Late Night with Conan O'Brien sketches#The Walker, Texas Ranger Lever|Lever]]", which increased the popularity of actor and public Huckabee supporter [[Chuck Norris]]. O'Brien reasoned that the popularity of Norris, fueled by the ''Late Night'' sketch, translated into support for Huckabee.<ref>A recurring gag on the show is O'Brien's use of a lever called ''"[[List of Late Night with Conan O'Brien sketches#The Walker, Texas Ranger Lever|The Walker, Texas Ranger Lever]]"'' to show clips from the series (most of the clips are usually fight scenes).

Retrieved on 2008-06-10.</ref>
Colbert later lashed out at O'Brien on his own show on January 16, 2008, claiming that ''he'' himself was responsible for Huckabee's success in [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2008|the Iowa caucus]] thanks to his giving Huckabee "the [[Cultural impact of The Colbert Report#The Colbert Bump|Colbert bump]]," a rise in popularity following an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.  The exasperated Colbert ended his rant with this "threat" against O'Brien:
<blockquote>
"So back off of Mike Huckabee, or I will kick your 'translucent white ass! You got that, Irish?"<ref>[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=147835 ''"Back Off Mike Huckabee"'']. ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Comedy Central. Aired on 2008-01-16. Retrieved on 2008-06-08</ref>
</blockquote>

During the January 17, 2008, episode of ''Late Night'', O'Brien, in what he later described as "a heated moment", called Colbert the "temporary host of ''The Colbert Report''."<ref name="Conan vs. Colbert"/>  O'Brien also refused to recant his statement concerning Huckabee, claiming that, just by mentioning Colbert on his network show, he was, in turn, "breathing life" into ''Colbert'''s "[[basic cable]]" career.<ref name="Conan vs. Colbert"/> Therefore, according to his logic, ''"if '''Colbert made Huckabee''', and '''Conan made Colbert''', then '''Conan made Huckabee'''!"''<ref name="Conan vs. Colbert">[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/index.shtml#mea=206915 ''"Conan vs. Colbert: Who Made Huckabee?

In response, during the January 29, 2008, episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert, persuaded by "the soundness of [O'Brien's] logic", was prepared to concede. Before he could, however, Jon Stewart, Colbert's former ''Daily Show'' colleague, appeared on the set and cautioned Colbert against doing so. Stewart exhibited a vintage VHS tape, which contained footage of him introducing O'Brien on Stewart's earlier [[MTV]] program, ''The Jon Stewart Show'', in 1994.<ref name="msnbc"/>  Therefore, by ''his'' own logic:
<blockquote>
"Colbert made Huckabee... Conan made Colbert... Jon Stewart made Conan... '''Jon Stewart made Huckabee!'''"<ref name="stewart">[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=148613 ''"Jon Settles Colbert-Conan Feud"'']. Comedy Central. Aired on 2008-01-29. Retrieved on 2008-06-09.</ref>
</blockquote>
Colbert accepted this, as it kept Huckabee's 'creation' "in the family."<ref name="stewart"/> Stewart then jokingly said it was up to O'Brien to respond, so that the three of them could "figure out a way to settle the matter that wastes time on all three of [their] shows"<ref name="stewart"/>—an obvious allusion to the writers' strike and the need to generate new material without said writers.  Colbert ended the segment with the crack, "Ball's in ''your'' court, Conan!"

=== Escalation ===
Upon learning of Stewart's involvement in the feud, O'Brien used his February 1, 2008, episode to show a modified photo of himself as a doctor delivering both Colbert and Stewart as babies, after which he proceeded to make fun of their [[genitalia]].<ref name="Stewart Gets Involved">[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/index.shtml#mea=213648 ''"Conan vs. Colbert: Stewart Gets Involved"'']. ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', [[NBC]]. Aired on 2008-02-01. Retrieved on 2008-07-19.</ref>  O'Brien continued the earlier chain of reasoning by arguing that by delivering Stewart and Colbert to the world, he deserved credit for any of their potential accomplishments, including Huckabee. O'Brien then made the following statement:

<blockquote>
"I think this ends the feud. But this is my warning—and this is ''not'' a threat, this is a promise! If either Stewart or Colbert mentions this again in ''any way'', I am going over to their tiny little studio, and I am kicking some Comedy Central ass!"<ref name="Stewart Gets Involved"/>
</blockquote>
This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three [[crossover (fiction)|appearing on each other's shows]] on February 4, 2008. It all began on the set of ''The Daily Show'', when Colbert, to thunderous applause, interrupted the middle of a seemingly normal show to thank Stewart for settling the feud.<ref name="LNT"/>  Stewart at first responded happily to this, but then grew visibly frightened once Colbert informed him of O'Brien's response from a few days before.<ref name="LNT">[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=155946 ''"Late Night Tangle"'']. ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Comedy Central. Aired on 2008-01-04. Retrieved on 2008-06-09.</ref> Colbert then began taunting O'Brien, calling him "cheap", "stupid" and "lazy"—much to Stewart's chagrin, who begged Colbert to stop. It was too late, however, as O'Brien, accompanied by thunderous applause, quickly walked in and furiously scolded the two for keeping the feud going.  A seething Colbert, nonetheless, refused to back down, and even snarled at O'Brien: "You want to tangle, Red?"<ref name="msnbc"/>  O'Brien agreed, but as the two prepared to take the fight outside, Stewart reminded them that he had to finish his show. O'Brien and Colbert agreed to wait outside, where they engaged in idle chit chat.<ref name="LNT"/>

When Stewart finished, he went into the hall to find Colbert was gone to tape his show.<ref>[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=155948 ''"Moment of Zen - Conan Fight"''].

=== Ending ===
On February 4, 2008, after O'Brien's monologue concerning his "feud" with Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, the two strutted ''[[West Side Story]]''-''Kick the Moon'' styles onto the set, accompanied by thunderous applause, and pulled O'Brien backstage. Colbert, O'Brien and Stewart then proceeded to fight it out to the tune of "[[Brianstorm]]", a song by the English [[alternative rock]] band [[Arctic Monkeys]].<ref>[[MTV Networks Asia|MTV Asia]].

Retrieved 2007-12-27</ref> It was one fight scene cliche after the other, from slow motion punching to falling into cardboard boxes to rolling down a flight of stairs. What followed was "four punishing, uninterrupted minutes of [[Louisville Slugger]] bludgeonings, the gruesome torching of pasty comedian flesh, and a near-beheading by the razor-sharp blades of a pair of hockey skates".<ref name="Violent">[http://defamer.com/352822/vicious-cross+network-melee-leaves-stewart-obrien-and-colbert-in-critical-condition Vicious Cross-Network Melee Leaves Stewart, O'Brien and Colbert In Critical Condition]</ref> The battle finally ended with a simultaneous freeze frame punch that turned into a parody of the end of ''[[Rocky III]]'' when the scene dissolved into a watercolor painting. Huckabee himself appeared, and declared:

{{Cquote|Let's be clear: None of these guys made me. This great nation made me. So vote for me. God bless America and forget these three idiots."<ref name="the brawl"/>}}

After that, the bell sounded and the image of Huckabee morphed into yet another ''Rocky III''-style painting, marking the end of the feud.<ref name="the brawl">[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/index.shtml#mea=213670 ''"Conan vs. Colbert: The Brawl"''].

== Aftermath ==

That same day, Colbert and Stewart issued the following joint statement:
<blockquote>
"Conan's claims on Mike Huckabee could not go unanswered.  We just hope the kids out there learned that sometimes the best way to resolve a conflict is with violence."<ref name="msnbc"/>
</blockquote>

Meanwhile, as O'Brien was recovering, he conducted an interview with ''[[The Associated Press]]'', and explained that one of the reasons he took part in the feud was because, "[Colbert] had been leaving me threatening messages. He got to me. I have a temper. A famous temper."<ref name="nyt"/>

Later that same day, on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart poked fun at the fight by calling it "the stupidest fucking thing anyone's ever seen."<ref>[http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=156112&title=battle-royale ''"Battle Royale"''].

While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a [[recycling]] bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat.  To which Colbert replied, "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin over your head and encouraged ''Conan'' to hit you with a baseball bat," and, as usual, left Stewart confused.  At the end of the segment, Stewart asked Colbert: "Did we win that [fight], by the way?"  Colbert's answer was, "I think America won, Jon."<ref>[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=155949 ''"Daily/Colbert - Apology"''].  ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Comedy Central.

=== Reception ===

Reaction to the "feud" by both the public and the media was, and still is, nearly uniformly positive.

Interestingly, upon returning to air on January 7, 2008, ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report'' had increased ratings. As of the end of January 2008, ''The Daily Show'' was up 17 percent for viewers between 18-34 from January 2007 and up nine percent for 18-49-year olds in the same period. ''The Colbert Report'' was up 21 percent for 18-34-year olds and 15 percent for 18-49-year olds over the same time period. ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', however, remained at a normal level, with 2.5&nbsp;million viewers.<ref name="nymag">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-11|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/14575/index.html|title=Conan on the Couch|publisher=[[New York magazine]]|date=September 26, 2005|author=Grigoriadis, Vanessa}}</ref>
One reason given for the increase in ''Daily Show'' and ''Colbert Report'' ratings was the [[United States presidential election, 2008|current presidential election]], allowing them a large amount of political humor to use.

In fact, not long after the "Who Made Huckabee?" feud culminated, the writers' strike officially ended on February 13, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/wga_strike_blog/2008/02/wgas-press-rele.html|title=WGA's Press Release|publisher=[[Variety magazine]]}}</ref> with the writers returning to work the following day, at which point the titles of ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report'' were restored.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stelter |first=Brian |title=Scripts Reappear on 'Daily Show' |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/business/media/18teleprompTer.html?ref=to&pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=February 18, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

In contrast to the strained relationship depicted on-camera among Colbert, O'Brien and Stewart,<ref>Franklin, Nancy (November 28, 2005).

Retrieved on 2007-12-20.</ref> O'Brien admitted that, "the three of us have come along in the same comedic environment,"<ref name="msnbc"/> and that, while "our shows all probably have their distinct flavor, [...] this happened because the three of us knew we would like doing this with each other."<ref name="msnbc"/> ''The Associated Press'' noted:
<blockquote>
"For anyone watching, it was clear the three hosts share a certain comedic sensibility. Such playfulness would seem impossible with other late-night talk-show hosts; [[CBS]]' [[David Letterman]] and NBC's [[Jay Leno]], for instance, have long had icy relations."<ref name="msnbc"/>
</blockquote>

This from TV Squad's Annie Wu:
<blockquote>
"I would also like to note that even those that haven't found this fake feud particularly amusing must find a bit of sweetness in it. After all, these are hosts that have constantly expressed how lost they feel without their writers. There's something wonderful in seeing three comedians doing each other a favor by creating some silly material and taking it this far, just to help fill time. This one dumb fight alone has taken up so many episodes. Bless their little late night hearts for helping each other out."<ref name="tv squad">[http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/02/05/the-obrien-vs-stewart-vs-colbert-three-show-throwdown-video/ The O'Brien vs. Stewart vs. Colbert three-show throwdown - VIDEOS].

In a similar fashion John Gillespie, of ''A Sensitivity to Things'', found the brawl "inspiring",<ref name="sensitivity"/> and stated:
<blockquote>
"What is really great about this clip, the in-joke that informs, underlines everything you see, is that these are three very famous people, working in exactly the same field, competing directly for television ratings and advertising dollars, who should supposedly have very large egos, making fun of all of that, and revealing&nbsp;— wait... is that irony, on American TV?&nbsp;— that they are probably very good friends, having a very good time."<ref name="sensitivity">Gillespie, John.

</blockquote>

"My favorite comedy is comedy where nothing is achieved and there is no point," O'Brien said. "That this whole Huckabee fight turned into an insane [[Marx Brothers]] dance was fitting somehow [...] The fight itself is three people with a box full of props playing for about an hour."<ref name="msnbc"/>
