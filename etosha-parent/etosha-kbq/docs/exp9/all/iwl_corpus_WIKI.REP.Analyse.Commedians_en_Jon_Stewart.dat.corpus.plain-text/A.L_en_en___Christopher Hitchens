'''Christopher Eric Hitchens''' (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was an Anglo-American<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/266963-t-he-hyphenation-question-is-and-always-has-been-and-will|title=Hitch-22 (Christopher Hitchens' memoir)}}</ref> author, literary critic and journalist.<ref name="ukwhoswho1">'Hitchens, Christopher Eric', Who's Who 2012, A & C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2012 ; online edn, January 2012 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U20283, accessed 5 May 2012]</ref>

He contributed to ''[[New Statesman]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[London Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[Slate]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]''. Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor and co-editor of over thirty books, including five collections of essays, on a range of subjects, including politics, literature and religion. A staple of talk shows and lecture circuits, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded and controversial figure. Known for his [[contrarian]] stance on a number of issues, Hitchens excoriated such public figures as [[Mother Teresa]]; [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Henry Kissinger]]; [[Noam Chomsky]]; [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]; and [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. He was the elder brother of the conservative journalist and author [[Peter Hitchens]].

Long describing himself as a [[Democratic socialism|socialist]] and a Marxist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the "tepid reaction" of the Western left to [[The Satanic Verses controversy|the controversy]] over ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton, and the "anti-war" movement's opposition to intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Even though Hitchens did not leave his position writing for ''The Nation'' until post-9/11, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position "that [[John Ashcroft]] is a greater menace than [[Osama bin Laden]]."<ref name=":78" /> The [[September 11 attacks]] "exhilarated" him, bringing into focus "a battle between everything I love and everything I hate," and strengthening his embrace of an [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy which challenged "[[Islamofascism|fascism with an Islamic face]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016fa_fact_parker?currentPage=all|title=Profiles: He Knew He Was Right : The New Yorker|date=16 October 2006|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> His numerous editorials in support of the [[Iraq War]] caused some to label him a [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]], although Hitchens insisted he was not "a conservative of any kind", and his friend [[Ian McEwan]] described him as representing the [[totalitarianism|anti-totalitarian]] left.<ref name="NewStatesman2010">Eaton, George.

Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been "invited by [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine ''La Regle du Jeu''. I gave it the partly ironic title: 'Can One Be a Neoconservative?' Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as 'How I Became a Neoconservative.' Perhaps this was an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: it was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought."</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=charlierose.com|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12297|title=A discussion about Christopher Hitchens (52-minute video)|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref> Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he was "still a [[Marxism|Marxist]]".<ref>{{youtube|Y-s9AyNQyCw|Paxman meets Hitchens full 30 minute interview with BBCs Jeremy Paxman RIP}}</ref>

A noted critic of religion and an [[antitheist]], he said that a person "could be an atheist and wish that belief in god were correct", but that "an antitheist, a term I'm trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there's no evidence for such an assertion".<ref>{{cite news|archiveurl=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1094-nothing-sacred-journalist-and-provocateur-christopher-hitchens-picks-a-fight-with-god|title=Nothing sacred—Journalist and provocateur Christopher Hitchens picks a fight with God|accessdate=2 May 2014|author=Andre Mayer | publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 May 2007|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/nothing_sacred.html|archivedate=16 May 2007}}</ref> According to Hitchens, the concept of a god or a supreme being is a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] belief that destroys individual freedom, and that free expression and scientific discovery should replace religion as a means of teaching ethics and defining human civilisation. His anti-religion [[polemic]], New York Times Bestseller, ''[[God Is Not Great]]: How Religion Poisons Everything,'' sold over 500,000 copies.

Hitchens died on 15 December 2011 from complications arising from [[esophageal cancer]], a disease that he acknowledged was more than likely due to his lifelong predilection for heavy smoking and drinking.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lucy Popescu|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/mortality-by-christopher-hitchens-8142191.html|title=Mortality, by Christopher Hitchens|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Hitchens was born in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary|title=Christopher Hitchens obituary|author=Peter Wilby|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/birth-marriage-death-and-parish-records/births-and-baptisms/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=christopher%20e&lastname=hitchens]</ref> His parents, Eric Ernest Hitchens (1909–87) and Yvonne Jean Hitchens (née Hickman; 1921–73), met in Scotland when both were serving in the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yglesias|first=Matthew|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2255781/entry/2255782|title=The Commander: My Father, Eric Hitchens|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref>  His mother was Jewish, and kept that fact a secret.<ref name="The Boy Can't Help It">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/868/index4.html|title=The Boy Can't Help It|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>  It was not until late 1987 that Hitchens learned of his Jewish ancestry (though he became a lifelong atheist).<ref name="The Boy Can't Help It"/><ref name="tabletmag.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/86541/the-tenth-man-2?all=1|title=On Christopher Hitchens’ Jewishness|work=Tablet Magazine}}</ref>  He said, "My initial reaction, apart from pleasure and interest, was the faint but definite feeling that I had somehow known all along."<ref name="tabletmag.com"/>  His mother was a "Wren" (a member of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]),<ref name="Hitch-22 Independent">Walsh, John.

Hitchens then went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was tutored by [[Steven Lukes]] and [[Anthony Kenny]] and read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. Hitchens was "bowled over" in his adolescence by [[Richard Llewellyn]]'s ''[[How Green Was My Valley]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]],'' [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', [[R. H.

In the 1960s, Hitchens joined the political left, drawn by his anger over the [[Vietnam War]], nuclear weapons, racism, and [[oligarchy]], including that of "the unaccountable corporation". He expressed affinity with the politically charged countercultural and protest movements [[Counterculture of the 1960s|of the 1960s and 1970s]]. He deplored the recreational drug use of the time, which he described as hedonistic.<ref name="hoover.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3420306.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070915092414/http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/3420306.html|archivedate=15 September 2007|publisher=Hoover Institution|title=YOU SAID YOU WANTED A REVOLUTION: 1968 and the Counter-Counterculture (Peter Robinson interview with William Buckley Jr and Christopher Hitchens)|work=web.archive.org |date=15 September 2007|accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

===Journalistic career (1970–81)===
Hitchens began working as a correspondent for the magazine ''[[International Socialism (journal)|International Socialism]]'',<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1972/no051/hitchens2.htm International Socialism: Christopher Hitchens "Workers' Self Management in Algeria" (1st series), No.51, April–June 1972, p.33], ''Encyclopedia of Trotskyism,'' 25 October 2005</ref> published by the [[International Socialist Tendency|International Socialists]], the forerunners of today's British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]. This group was broadly Trotskyist, but differed from more orthodox Trotskyist groups in its refusal to defend communist states as "[[workers' states]]". Their slogan was "Neither Washington nor Moscow but [[International Socialism]]".

Hitchens left Oxford with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|third class]] degree.<ref name="Prospect profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10157|title=Christopher Hitchins|accessdate=17 February 2009|author=Alexander Linklater|date=May 2008|work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430204908/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10157|archivedate=30 April 2008}}</ref> In 1971 he went to work at the ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' where he served as a [[social science]] correspondent.<ref name="ukwhoswho1"/> Hitchens admitted that he hated the position, and was fired after six months in the job: he recalled, "I sometimes think if I'd been any good at that job, I might still be doing it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NegtQIkhz6g|title=Christopher Hitchens Explains Why You Should Quit Your Job|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref> Next he was a researcher for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Weekend World]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/181752/|title=Christopher Hitchens: the New Statesman years|work=newstatesman.com}}</ref> In 1973 he went to work for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where his colleagues included the authors [[Martin Amis]], who he had briefly met at Oxford, [[Julian Barnes]] and [[James Fenton]], with whom he had shared a house in Oxford.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It was at this time that the legendary Friday lunches began, which were attended by writers including [[Clive James]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Terence Kilmartin]],  [[Robert Conquest]], [[Al Alvarez]], [[Peter Porter]], [[Russell Davies]] and [[Mark Boxer]].  At the ''New Statesman'' Hitchens acquired a reputation as a fierce left-winger, aggressively attacking targets such as [[Henry Kissinger]], the Vietnam War, and the Roman Catholic Church.

In November 1973, Hitchens's mother committed suicide in [[Athens]] in a suicide pact with her lover, a defrocked clergyman named Timothy Bryan.<ref name="Hitch-22 Independent"/> The pair overdosed on sleeping pills in adjoining hotel rooms, and Bryan slashed his wrists in the bathtub. Hitchens flew alone to Athens to recover his mother's body, initially under the impression that his mother had been murdered. Both her children were then independent adults. While in Greece, Hitchens reported on the constitutional crisis of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military junta]]. It became his first leading article for the ''New Statesman''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/apr/14/politics|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Look who's talking|first=Lynn|last=Barber|date=13 April 2002|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>

In December 1977, Hitchens interviewed Argentine dictator [[Jorge Rafaél Videla]], a conversation he later described as "horrifying".<ref>http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/hitchens200412</ref>

In 1977, unhappy at the ''New Statesman'', Hitchens defected to the ''[[Daily Express]]'' where he became a foreign correspondent.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He returned to the New Statesman in 1979 where he became foreign editor.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===American career (1981–2011)===
Hitchens went to the United States in 1981, as part of an editor exchange program between ''The New Statesman'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.<ref>[http://www.thenation.com/article/165318/remembering-hitchens# Remembering Hitchens] by [[Victor Navasky]], ''[[The Nation]]'', 21 December 2011</ref> After joining ''The Nation'', he penned vociferous critiques of [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H.

===Literature reviews===
Hitchens wrote a monthly essay on books in ''[[The Atlantic]]''<ref>[http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/by/christopher_hitchens Authors—Christopher Hitchens] ''[[The Atlantic]]''</ref> and contributed occasionally to other literary journals. One of his books, ''Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere'', is a collection of such works, and ''Love, Poverty and War'' contains a section devoted to literary essays. In ''Why Orwell Matters'', he defends Orwell's writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book ''Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left'', many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as [[David Horowitz]] and [[Edward Said]].

The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' referred to Hitchens as a "[[social gadfly|gadfly]] with gusto".<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/comments/view?f=/c/a/2005/06/26/LVGIHDBORH1.DTL FIVE QUESTIONS FOR: Christopher Hitchens] SF Gate</ref> In 2009, Hitchens was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the "25 most influential liberals in the U.S. media".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/22/influential-media-obama-oped-cx_tv_ee_hra_0122liberal_slide_13.html?thisSpeed=30000|title=The 25 Most Influential Liberals in the US Media|date=22 January 2009|work=Forbes|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> The same article noted that he would "likely be aghast to find himself on this list", since it reduces his self-styled radicalism to mere liberalism. Hitchens's political perspective appears in his wide ranging writings, which include many of the political dialogues he published.

In 2010, [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote, "Christopher made an early commitment to [[Trotskyism]], but it is difficult to take him very seriously as a revolutionary because he always has been too much of a hedonist. Indeed, he appears to me to have had roughly the same relationship to proletarians as Marie Antoinette had to sheep: They have walk-on parts in his personal drama. There is not much evidence of his having thought deeply, or even at all, about the fate, under a social system he vociferously advocated, of the pleasures he so clearly values, the liking for which I don't in the least blame him; nor is there evidence of any real reflection on what the world would have been like had his demands been met. Not permanent revolution but permanent adolescence has been his goal, and I think he has achieved it."<ref>[{{cite news | url = http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/05/the-brothers-grim | date = June–July 2010 | title = The Brothers Grim | author = Dalrymple, Theodore | work= First Things | accessdate=25 December 2013}}]</ref>

===Ideology===
Hitchens became a socialist "largely [as] the outcome of a study of history, taking sides&nbsp;... in the battles over industrialism and war and empire." In 2001, he told Rhys Southan of ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine that he could no longer say "I am a socialist". Socialists, he claimed, had ceased to offer a positive alternative to the capitalist system. Capitalism had become the more revolutionary economic system, and he welcomed [[globalisation]] as "innovative and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]", but added, "I don't think that the contradictions, as we used to say, of the system, are by any means all resolved." He stated that he had a renewed interest in the freedom of the individual from the state, but that he still considered [[libertarianism]] "ahistorical" both on the world stage and in the work of creating a stable and functional society, adding that libertarians are "more worried about the over-mighty state than the unaccountable corporation" whereas "the present state of affairs&nbsp;... combines the worst of bureaucracy with the worst of the insurance companies."<ref>{{cite news|author=Rhys Southan from the November 2001 issue|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/11/01/free-radical|title=Free Radical|work=Reason|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, in a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania debating the [[Judaism|Jewish Tradition]] with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his political philosophy by stating, "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a [[Marxist]]".<ref>{{YouTube|K6rRA64f9ug|Martin Amis Christopher Hitchens a conversation about Antisemitism and Saul bellow Part 3}}</ref> In a June 2010 interview with ''The New York Times'', he stated that "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06fob-q4-t.html|title=The Contrarian|first=Deborah|last=Solomon|work=The New York Times|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> In 2009, in an article for ''The Atlantic'' entitled "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the [[late-2000s recession]] in terms of [[Marxist economics|Marx's economic analysis]] and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was.<ref>Christopher Hitchens. [http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200904/hitchens-marx "The Revenge of Karl Marx"] ''The Atlantic'', April 2009</ref> Hitchens was an admirer of [[Che Guevara]], yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a "cult".<ref>Hitchens, Christopher (1997), [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jul/17/goodbye-to-all-that/ "Goodbye to All That"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 17 July 1997</ref> In 2004 he resumed his positive view of Che, commenting that "[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us [[bourgeois]] [[Romanticism|romantics]] insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jul/11/features.review Just a Pretty Face?] The Guardian, 11 July 2004</ref>

===Iraq War and the war on terror===
In the years after the ''[[fatwa]]'' [[The Satanic Verses controversy#Fatwā by Ayatollah Khomeini|issued against Salman Rushdie]] in response to his novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', Hitchens became increasingly critical of what he called "excuse making" on the left. At the same time, he was attracted to the foreign policy ideas of some on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-right that promoted pro-liberalism intervention, especially the [[neoconservative]] group that included [[Paul Wolfowitz]].<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2115170/ "That Bleeding Heart Wolfowitz"], ''Slate'', 22 March 2005</ref> Around this time, he befriended the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] dissident and businessman [[Ahmed Chalabi]].<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2101345/ "Ahmad and Me"], ''Slate'', 27 May 2004</ref> In 2004, Hitchens stated that neoconservative support for US intervention in Iraq convinced him that he was "on the same side as the neo-conservatives" when it came to contemporary foreign policy issues.<ref name="InEnemyTerritory">Johann Hari, [http://johannhari.com/2004/09/23/in-enemy-territory-an-interview-with-christopher-hitchens/ "In Enemy Territory: An Interview with Christopher Hitchens"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 23 September 2004.</ref> Hitchens had also been known to refer to his association with "temporary neocon allies".<ref name="EndOfFukuyama">Christopher Hitchens, [http://www.slate.com/id/2137134/ "The End of Fukuyama"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 1 March 2006</ref>

Following 11 September attacks, Hitchens and [[Noam Chomsky]] debated the nature of [[Islamism|radical Islam]] and the proper response to it. In October 2001, Hitchens wrote criticisms of Chomsky in ''The Nation''.<ref>Christopher Hitchens, [http://www.thenation.com/article/sin-left-islamic-fascism "Of Sin, the Left & Islamic Fascism"], ''[[The Nation]]'', 8 October 2001</ref><ref>Christopher Hitchens, [http://www.thenation.com/article/blaming-bin-laden-first "Blaming bin Laden First"] ''The Nation'', 22 October 2001</ref> Chomsky responded<ref>Noam Chomsky, [http://www.thenation.com/article/reply-hitchens "Reply to Hitchens"], ''The Nation'', 15 October 2001</ref> and Hitchens issued a rebuttal to Chomsky<ref>Christopher Hitchens, [http://www.thenation.com/article/rejoinder-noam-chomsky "A Rejoinder to Noam Chomsky"], ''[[The Nation]]'', 15 October 2001</ref> to which Chomsky again responded.<ref name=":78">Noam Chomsky, [http://www.thenation.com/article/reply-hitchenss-rejoinder "Reply to Hitchens's Rejoinder"], ''The Nation'', 15 October 2001</ref> Approximately a year after 11 September attacks and his exchanges with Chomsky, Hitchens left ''The Nation'', claiming that its editors, readers and contributors considered [[John Ashcroft]] a bigger threat than Osama bin Laden,<ref name=autogenerated2>Christopher Hitchens, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20021014/hitchens "Taking Sides"], ''The Nation'', 26 September 2002</ref> and that they were making excuses on behalf of Islamist terrorism; in the following months he wrote articles increasingly at odds with his colleagues.

Christopher Hitchens argued the case for the Iraq War in a 2003 collection of essays entitled ''[[A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq]]'', and participated in public debates on the topic with [[George Galloway]],<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZnUIeKOIgc|title=George Galloway vs Christopher Hitchens (1 of 12)|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> [[Scott Ritter]],<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU45ioYvx4k|title=Christopher Hitchens versus Ritter—Iraq War debate part 1|publisher=YouTube|date=30 April 2009|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> and his brother [[Peter Hitchens]].<ref name="FPW2008">{{cite web|url=http://hauensteincenter.org/hitchens-vs-hitchens-faith-politics-war/|title=Hitchens v.

===Criticism of George W. Bush===
Prior to 11 September 2001, and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], Hitchens was critical of President [[George W. Bush]]'s "[[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]]" foreign policy. He also criticised Bush's support of [[intelligent design]]<ref name=autogenerated4>Belz, Mindy. [http://www.worldmag.com/articles/11908 "According to Hitch"], ''World Magazine'', 3 April 2006</ref> and [[Capital punishment in Texas|capital punishment]].<ref name=AWarToBeProudOf>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/995phqjw.asp "A War To Be Proud Of"] ''Weekly Standard'', 5 September 2005</ref>

Although Hitchens defended Bush's post-11 September foreign policy, he criticised the actions of US troops in [[Abu Ghraib]] and [[Haditha]], and the US government's use of [[waterboarding]], which he unhesitatingly deemed as [[torture]] after he was invited by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' to voluntarily undergo it.<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/hitchens200808 "Believe Me, It's Torture"], ''Vanity Fair'', August 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/video/2008/hitchens_video200808|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809003051/http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/video/2008/hitchens_video200808|title=Video: On the Waterboard|archivedate=9 August 2011|work=Vanity Fair}}</ref> In January 2006, Hitchens joined with four other individuals and four organisations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Greenpeace]], as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ''[[ACLU v.

===Presidential endorsements===
Hitchens would elaborate on his political views and ideological shift in a discussion with [[Eric Alterman]] on [[Bloggingheads.tv]]. In this discussion Hitchens revealed himself to be a supporter of [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 US presidential election]], who was disenchanted with the candidacy of both George W. Bush and [[Al Gore]].<ref>[http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/15143 On Whether Christopher Hitchens Was Wrong] Bloggingheads.tv, 14 October 2008</ref>
[[File:DebateCommissionProtest 2000.JPG|thumb|left|Hitchens speaking at a September 2000 [[Third party (United States)|third party]] protest at the headquarters of the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]]]]

Hitchens made a brief return to ''The Nation'' just before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 US presidential election]] and wrote that he was "slightly" for Bush; shortly afterwards, ''Slate'' polled its staff on their positions on the candidates and mistakenly printed Hitchens's vote as pro-[[John Kerry]]. Hitchens shifted his opinion to "neutral", saying: "It's absurd for liberals to talk as if [[Kristallnacht]] is impending with Bush, and it's unwise and indecent for Republicans to equate Kerry with capitulation. There's no one to whom he can surrender, is there? I think that the nature of the [[jihad]]ist enemy will decide things in the end".<ref>[http://slate.com/Default.aspx?id=2108966&MSID=E66DE5EE72A24A8DB5EA0B00288546C1 My Endorsement and Osama's Video: The news in Bin Laden's comments had nothing to do with our election] ''Slate'', 1 November 2004</ref>

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Hitchens in an article for ''Slate'' stated, "I used to call myself a [[single-issue voter]] on the essential question of defending civilisation against its terrorist enemies and their totalitarian protectors, and on that 'issue' I hope I can continue to expose and oppose any ambiguity." He was critical of both main party candidates, [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]], but wrote that Obama would be the better choice. Hitchens went on to call McCain "senile", and his choice of running mate [[Sarah Palin]] "absurd", calling Palin a "pathological liar" and a "national disgrace". Hitchens also wrote that "Obama is greatly overrated" and that the Obama-Biden ticket "show[s] some signs of being able and willing to profit from experience".<ref>Hitchens, Christopher "[http://www.slate.com/id/2202163/ Vote for Obama]" ''Slate'', 13 October 2008. Retrieved 5 November 2009</ref>

===Israel–Palestine===
Hitchens had said of himself, "I am an [[anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]]. I'm one of those people of Jewish descent who believes that [[Zionism]] would be a mistake even if there were no [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]."<ref name="HölblingRieser-Wohlfarter2004">{{cite book|first1=Walter|last1= Hölbling|first2=Klaus|last2= Rieser-Wohlfarter|title=What is American?: new identities in U.S. culture| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_Tn7LqhWI7IC&pg=PA351|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7734-7|pages=351–}}</ref>

A review of his autobiography ''Hitch-22'' in ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' refers to Hitchens "at the time [that he had learned that his grandparents were Jews, he had been] a prominent anti-Zionist" and says that he viewed Zionism "as an injustice against the Palestinians".<ref name="Forward">{{cite journal |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/128323/ |title=Born Grumpy, with a Talent for It: Christopher Hitchens's Memoir is Too Happy by Far |last=Goldstein|first=Evan R.|journal=Jewish Daily Forward|date=June 2010}}</ref> Others have commented on his anti-Zionism as well.<ref name="Rodden2006">{{cite book|first=John|last= Rodden |title=Every intellectual's big brother: George Orwell's literary siblings |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UlnwITCGcw8C&pg=PA95|accessdate=6 April 2011 |year=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71308-6|pages=95–}}</ref> At other times for example speaking at 2nd annual Memorial for [[Daniel Pearl]], and in print in an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' he had made comments against the terrorism against Jews in the Middle East. Hitchens stated "But the Jews of the Arab lands were expelled again in revenge for the defeat of Palestinian nationalistic aspirations, in 1947–48, and now the absolute most evil and discredited fabrication of Jew-baiting Christian Europe—The Protocols of the Elders of Zion—is eagerly promulgated in the Hamas charter and on the group's Web site and recycled through a whole nexus of outlets that includes schools as well as state-run television stations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/chosen/308173/|title=Chosen|author=Christopher Hitchens|date=11 August 2010|work=The Atlantic}}</ref>

In ''Slate'' magazine, Hitchens pondered the notion that, instead of curing [[antisemitism]] through the creation of a Jewish state, "Zionism has only replaced and repositioned"<ref name="Slate60">{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2191193/|title=Slate: Can Israel Survive for Another 60 Years?|work=Slate.com|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> it, saying: "there are three groups of 6 million Jews. The first 6 million live in what the Zionist movement used to call Palestine. The second 6 million live in the United States. The third 6 million are distributed mainly among Russia, France, Britain, and Argentina. Only the first group lives daily in range of missiles that can be (and are) launched by people who hate Jews." Hitchens argued that instead of supporting Zionism, Jews should help "secularise and reform their own societies", believing that unless one is religious, "what the hell are you doing in the greater Jerusalem area in the first place?" Indeed, Hitchens goes so far as to claim that the only justification for Zionism given by Jews is a religious one.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kerstein|first=Benjamin|title=Christopher Hitchens's Jewish Problem|url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/module/2010/12/13/main-feature/1/christopher-hitchenss-jewish-problem|publisher=[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>

In his 2006 debate with Martin Amis, Hitchens stated that "one must not insult or degrade or humiliate people"<ref name=FrontPage>{{cite web| url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=11253|title=Frontpage Interview: Christopher Hitchens Part II|work=FrontPage Magazine|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> and that he "would be opposed to this maltreatment of the Palestinians if it took place on a remote island with no geopolitical implications". Hitchens described Zionism as "an ethno-nationalist quasi-religious ideology" and stated his desire that if possible, he would "re-wind the tape [to] stop [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] from telling the initial [[demagogue|demagogic]] lie (actually two lies) that [[A land without a people for a people without a land|a land without a people needs a people without a land]]".

He continued to say that Zionism "...&nbsp;nonetheless has founded a sort of democratic state which isn't any worse in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins." He stated that [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] in order to achieve security for Israel is "doomed to fail in the worst possible way", and the cessation of this "appallingly racist and messianic delusion" would "confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews". Hitchens contended that the "solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists" and wondered "What did they imagine would be the response of the followers of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] [Muhammad]?" Hitchens bemoaned the transference into religious terrorism of Arab secularism as a means of democratisation: "the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those who care about democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of Hamas and Islamic Jihad".<ref name="Slate60"/> He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a "trivial squabble" that has become "so dangerous to all of us" because of "the faith-based element."<ref name="FrontPage"/>

Hitchens collaborated on this issue with prominent Palestinian advocate [[Edward Said]], in 1988 publishing ''[[Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question]]''.

===Domestic policy===
Hitchens actively supported [[drug policy reform]] and called for the abolition of the "[[War on Drugs]]" which he described as an "authoritarian war" during a debate with [[William F. Buckley]].<ref name="hoover.org"/> He supported the legalisation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for both medical and recreational purposes, citing it as a cure for glaucoma and as treatment for numerous side-effects induced by chemotherapy, including severe nausea, describing the prohibition of the drug as "sadistic".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jul/11/features.review Just a Pretty Face?] by Sean O'Hagan, ''The Observer'', 11 July 2004</ref>

===Criticism of Mormonism===
Hitchens was extremely critical of the doctrinal claims of [[Mormonism]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2007/god_is_not_great/mormonism_a_racket_becomes_a_religion.html|title=From God Is Not Great|date=27 April 2007|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> and opposed the candidacy of [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/10/is_mormonism_a_cult_who_cares_it_s_their_weird_and_sinister_beli.html|title=Romney’s Mormon Problem|date=17 October 2011|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>

==Critiques of specific individuals==
Hitchens was known for his scathing critiques of public figures. Three figures—Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, and Mother Teresa—were the targets of three separate full length texts, ''[[No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton]]'', ''[[The Trial of Henry Kissinger]]'', and ''[[The Missionary Position]]: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice''. Hitchens also wrote book-length biographical essays about [[Thomas Jefferson]] (''[[Thomas Jefferson: Author of America]]''), [[George Orwell]] (''[[Why Orwell Matters]]''), and [[Thomas Paine]] (''[[Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man": A Biography]]'').

The majority of Hitchens's critiques took the form of short opinion pieces, including critiques of: [[Jerry Falwell]],<ref>{{YouTube|52yTqMcwuQE|Video: Christopher Hitchens (15 May 2007) appearance on Anderson Cooper 360}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|doKkOSMaTk4|Video: Christopher Hitchens (16 May 2007) appearance on Hannity & Colmes about Rev.

It wouldn't take you long if I challenged you on [[Milton Berle]], or [[Woody Allen]], or [[John Cleese]], or even [[Lenny Bruce]] or [[Mort Sahl]]. By this time tomorrow, I bet you haven't come up with a real joke for which Hope could take credit." Critics argued that Hitchens focused solely on Hope's declining years and ignored his heyday in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/08/hopeless.html|title=Bob Hope wasn't funny. – Slate Magazine|date=1 August 2003|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>

==Views on religion==
{{See also|God Is Not Great}}
Hitchens often spoke against the [[Abrahamic religions]], what he called "the three great [[monotheism]]s" ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]). When asked by readers of ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) what he considered to be the "axis of evil", Hitchens replied "Christianity, Judaism, Islam – the three leading monotheisms."<ref>"You Ask the Questions; (such as: So, Christopher Hitchens, are You a Role Model for the Englishman Abroad? and what's Your Next Feud Going to be?)." ''The Independent'' (London): 7. Print. 6 March 2002.</ref> In ''God Is Not Great'', Hitchens expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists, such as [[Buddhism]] and [[neo-paganism]]; the book received mixed responses, from praise in ''[[The New York Times]]'' for his "logical flourishes and conundrums"<ref>Michael Kinsley [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Kinsley-t.html "In god, Distrust"] ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', 13 May 2007</ref> to accusations of "intellectual and moral shabbiness" in the ''[[Financial Times]]''.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6afa3a28-1ecd-11dc-bc22-000b5df10621.html Here's the hitch] by Michael Skapinker in ''[[The Financial Times]]''</ref> ''God Is Not Great'' was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] on 10 October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gIKp6SMKuAR1cD8M3gd3OePuyDbgD8S6HC081|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013061505/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gIKp6SMKuAR1cD8M3gd3OePuyDbgD8S6HC081|title=The Associated Press: Hitchens Among Book Award Finalists|archivedate=13 October 2007|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/bestseller/0603besthardnonfiction.html Hardcover Nonfiction] [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], 3 June 2007</ref>

Hitchens said that organized religion is "the main source of hatred in the world",<ref>[http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2007/03/free_speech_6.html Free Speech] onegoodmove, March 2007</ref> "[v]iolent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children", and that accordingly it "ought to have a great deal on its conscience". He often spoke about his efforts to champion the word 'antitheist' as he expressed his position that it was a relief that there is no evidence for a 'celestial North Korea'. Atheism was a word not strong enough to encompass his feelings about the immoral conundrum that the existence of a deity would necessarily imply. In ''God Is Not Great'', Hitchens said that:

<blockquote>
[A]bove all, we are in need of a renewed Enlightenment, which will base itself on the proposition that the proper study of mankind is man and woman [alluding to [[Alexander Pope]]]. This Enlightenment will not need to depend, like its predecessors, on the heroic breakthroughs of a few gifted and exceptionally courageous people. It is within the compass of the average person. The study of literature and poetry, both for its own sake and for the eternal ethical questions with which it deals, can now easily depose the scrutiny of sacred texts that have been found to be corrupt and confected. The pursuit of unfettered scientific inquiry, and the availability of new findings to masses of people by electronic means, will revolutionise our concepts of research and development. Very importantly, the divorce between the sexual life and fear, and the sexual life and disease, and the sexual life and tyranny, can now at last be attempted, on the sole condition that we banish all religions from the discourse. And all this and more is, for the first time in our history, within the reach if not the grasp of everyone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|publisher=Twelve Books|date=May 2007|location=New York|page=283}}</ref>
</blockquote>

''God Is Not Great'', rendered Hitchens a major advocate of the "[[New Atheism]]" movement, and he also was made an Honorary Associate of the [[National Secular Society]].<ref>[http://www.secularism.org.uk/patrickharviemsp1.html Honorary Associate: Christopher Hitchens] National Secular Society</ref> Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. He also served on the advisory board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]],<ref>[http://www.secular.org/bios/Christopher_Hitchens.html Biography—Christopher Hitchens] Secular Coalition for America Advisory Board</ref> a lobbying group for atheists and humanists in Washington, DC. In 2007, Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question "Is Christianity Good for the World?" with Christian theologian and pastor, [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], published in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/mayweb-only/119-12.0.html "Is Christianity Good for the World?"] Christianity Today, 8 May 2007</ref> This exchange eventually became a book by the same title in 2008. During their book tour to promote the book, film producer [[Darren Doane]] sent a film crew to accompany them. Doane produced the film ''[[Collision (2009 film)|Collision]]'': ''Is Christianity GOOD for the World?,'' which was released on 27 October 2009. On 4 April 2009 Hitchens debated [[William Lane Craig]] on the existence of God at [[Biola University]].<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2009/april/hitchens-vs-craig-round-two.html "Hitchens vs. Caig: Round Two"] Christianity Today, 6 April 2009</ref>

On 26 November 2010, Hitchens appeared in Toronto, Ontario at the [[Munk Debates]], where he debated religion with former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], a convert to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Blair argued religion is a force for good, while Hitchens was against it. Preliminary results on the Munk website said 56 per cent of the votes backed the proposition (Hitchens's position) before hearing the debate, with 22 per cent against (Blair's position), and 21 per cent undecided, with the undecided voters leaning toward Hitchens, giving him a 68 per cent to 32 per cent victory over Blair, after the debate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hitchens-apparent-winner-in-religion-debate-1.930421|title=Hitchens apparent winner in religion debate |newspaper=CBC News|date=27 November 2010|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munkdebates.com/debates/|title=Munk Debates Website|publisher=Munkdebates.com|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref>

In February 2006, Hitchens helped organise a pro-Denmark rally outside the Danish Embassy in Washington, DC in response to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wonkette.com/156915/instant-team-party-crash-legoland-uber-alles|title=Instant Team Party Crash: Legoland Uber Alles|author=Pareene, Alex|accessdate=9 December 2010|date=4 February 2006|publisher=[[Wonkette]]}}</ref>

Hitchens was accused by [[Bill Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League for Religious and Civil Liberties]] of being particularly [[anti-Catholic]]. Hitchens responded "when religion is attacked in this country&nbsp;... the Catholic Church comes in for a little more than its fair share".<ref>[http://www.catholicleague.org/06press_releases/quarter%203/060801_look_who.htm Look Who's Hammering Mel]{{Dead link|date=December 2011}} 1 August 2006</ref> Hitchens had also been accused of anti-Catholic bigotry by others, including Brent Bozell, Tom Piatak in ''[[The American Conservative]]'', and [[UCLA]] Law Professor [[Stephen Bainbridge]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070521175846/http://www.miamisunpost.com/0517bound.htm "Hood, John Hollowed Be Thy Name"].

Hitchens was raised nominally Christian, and went to Christian boarding schools but from an early age declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side. According to Hitchens, when his brother Peter took his fiancée to meet their maternal grandmother, who was then in her 90s, she said of his fiancée, "She's Jewish, isn't she?" and then announced: "Well, I've got something to tell you. So are you." Hitchens found out that his maternal grandmother, Dorothy [[surnames|née]] Levin, was Jewish (Dorothy's father and maternal grandfather were Jewish, and Dorothy's maternal grandmother—Hitchens's matrilineal great-great-grandmother—was a [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] to Judaism). Hitchens's maternal grandfather converted to Judaism before marrying Dorothy Levin.<ref>Hitch-22</ref> Hitchens's Jewish-born ancestors were immigrants from Eastern Europe (including Poland).<ref name="guardianjewish">[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,683899,00.html Look who's talking] ''The Observer'', 14 April 2002</ref><ref>''Hitch-22'', page 352.</ref> In an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 14 April 2002, Hitchens stated that he could be considered Jewish because [[Who is a Jew|Jewish descent]] is traditionally traced matrilineally.<ref name="guardianjewish"/><ref name="Karaite-Korner.org">[http://karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml] In the [[Tanakh]] itself, Jewishness is traced primarily patrilineally.

In February 2010, Christopher Hitchens was named to the Honorary Board of distinguished achievers of the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/news/releases/honorary-ffrf-board-announced/|title=Honorary FFRF Board Announced|accessdate=20 August 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101217052917/http://ffrf.org/news/releases/honorary-ffrf-board-announced/|archivedate=17 December 2010}}</ref>

===Hitchens' Dictum===
The following dictum is widely attributed to Hitchens and has become known as Hitchens' Dictum:

  What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

==Personal life==
[[File:HitchensTalk.JPG|thumb|Hitchens after a talk at [[The College of New Jersey]] in March 2009]]

===Marriages and children===

Retrieved 30 May 2010</ref> in 1981; the couple had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sophia. They divorced in 1989. From February 1990, Hitchens's girlfriend was reported as being Carol Blue, a Californian screenwriter.<ref>''The Washington Times'' 9 February 1990, Friday, Final Edition BYLINE: Charlotte Hays; THE WASHINGTON TIMES SECTION: Part E; LIFE; CHARLOTTE'S WEB; Pg.

They had a daughter, Antonia.<ref name="newyorkmetro1999"/>

===Parents===
Hitchens's father, Eric Hitchens, was a commander in the British [[Royal Navy]]. Hitchens often referred to his father as simply the 'Commander'. Hitchens's father was deployed on the [[HMS Jamaica (44)|HMS ''Jamaica'']] which took part in the sinking of the German battleship [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] on 26 December 1943. Christopher Hitchens would refer to his father's contribution to the war: 'Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done.' He also stated that 'the remark that most summed him [his father] up was the flat statement that the war of 1939 to 1945 had been "the only time when I really felt I knew what I was doing."'<ref>{{cite web|last=Hichens|first=Christopher|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2010/hitch22/the_commander_my_father_eric_hitchens.html|title=The Commander: My Father, Eric Hitchens|publisher=Slate.com|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref>

Hitchens's mother, Yvonne, died in [[Athens]] in 1973 when, despite first reports in The Times that she had been murdered, it was later concluded that her death had been the result of an apparent suicide pact with her boyfriend, Reverend Timothy Bryan. Hitchens travelled to Athens to identify his mother's body. On the subject Hitchens later said: 'She probably thought things were getting sordid—he [Bryan] wasn't able to hold a job down, she couldn't go back, she was probably about the age I am now and perhaps there was that—she'd been very pretty—and things were never going to get any better, so why go through with it? She might not have been that hard to persuade, but I know that she did try to save herself because I have the photographs still. So that was sort of the end of family life really.'<ref>{{cite web|author=Lynn Barber|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/apr/14/politics|title=Lynn Barber meets Christopher Hitchens|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2002|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref>

In reference to writing about his mother in his memoir, ''[[Hitch-22]]'', he said, 'It was painful to write about my mother, but not very because long ago I internally managed all that. 'I even went back to Greece and I went to the graveyard while I was writing the book and decided not to write about it. I thought that would be sentimental.'<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/14/christopher-hitchens-on-h_n_611243.html "Hitch-22: A Memoir"], ''Huffington Post''</ref>

===Relationship with his younger brother===
Hitchens's younger brother by two-and-a-half years, [[Peter Hitchens]], is a Christian and socially conservative journalist, although, like his brother, he had been a Trotskyist in the 1970s. The brothers had a protracted falling-out after Peter wrote that Christopher had once joked that he "didn't care if the [[Red Army]] watered its horses at [[Hendon]]" (a suburb of London).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/06/hitchens200506|title=O Brother, Why Art Thou?|author=Christopher Hitchens|work=Vanity Fair |publisher=Condé Nast Publications|date=16 May 2005|accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref> Christopher denied having said this and broke off contact with his brother. He then referred to his brother as "an idiot" in a letter to ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', and the dispute spilled into other publications as well. Christopher eventually expressed a willingness to reconcile and to meet his new nephew (born in 1999); shortly thereafter the brothers gave several interviews together in which they said that their personal disagreements had been resolved. They appeared together on edition of 21 June 2007 of the [[BBC]] current affairs discussion show ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. The pair engaged in a formal televised debate for the first time on 3 April 2008, at [[Grand Valley State University]],<ref name="FPW2008" /> and at the Pew Forum on 12 October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/Belief-in-God/Can-Civilization-Survive-Without-God-.aspx|title=Can Civilization Survive Without God?|date=12 October 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project}}</ref>

In 1999, the brothers debated before an audience (which included [[Ian McEwan]], [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Billy Bragg]]) in London, televised on [[C-SPAN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/133849|title=[The Abolition of Britain&#93; – C-SPAN Video Library|publisher=C-spanvideo.org|date=14 October 1999|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>

===Smoking and drinking===
''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described Hitchens as "Usually armed with a glass of Scotch and an untipped [[Rothmans International|Rothmans]] cigarette."<ref>The Sunday Times (London) 18 December 2011 Sunday Edition 1; Northern Ireland Christopher Hitchens; OBITUARIES; Polemicist who lived a life of dissolution and contrariness SECTION: NEWS REVIEW;FEATURES; OBITUARIES; Pg. 8</ref> In late 2007 he briefly gave up smoking, although resumed during the writing of his memoir and continued until his cancer diagnosis.<ref>Edward Luce, Lunch with the Financial Times, 11 January 2008</ref> Hitchens admitted to drinking heavily; in 2003 he wrote that his daily intake of alcohol was enough "to kill or stun the average mule", arguing that many great writers "did some of their finest work when blotto, smashed, polluted, shitfaced, squiffy, whiffled, and three sheets to the wind."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Christopher Hitchens|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2003/03/hitchens-200303|title=Living Proof'|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=March 2003|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref>

[[George Galloway]] notably accused Hitchens of being a "drink-sodden ex-[[Trotskyist]] [[wikt:popinjay|popinjay]]",<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/641kyjkk.asp ''Unmitigated Galloway ''], [[The Weekly Standard]], 30 May 2005</ref> to which Hitchens replied, "only some of which is true."<ref>"There's only one popinjay here, George", ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 19 May 2005</ref> Hitchens later elaborated: "He says that I am an ex-Trotskyist (true), a 'popinjay' (true enough, since the word's original [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's]] definition is a target for arrows and shots), and that I cannot hold a drink (here I must protest)."<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2126121/ ''George Galloway Is Gruesome, Not Gorgeous''], ''Slate'', 13 September 2005</ref> Hitchens's wife Carol Blue described him as "obviously an alcoholic, he functions at a really high level and he doesn't act like a drunk, so the only reason it's a bad thing is it's taking out his liver, presumably. It would be a drag for Henry Kissinger to live to a hundred and Christopher to keel over next year."<ref name="left-to-right">{{cite journal|work=The New Yorker|title=He Knew He Was Right|author=Ian Parker|date=16 October 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016fa_fact_parker?currentPage=all}}</ref> His profile in ''The New Yorker'' described him as drinking "like a Hemingway character: continually and to no apparent effect."<ref name="left-to-right"/>

Oliver Burkeman writes, "Since the parting of ways on Iraq ... Hitchens claims to have detected a new, personalised nastiness in the attacks on him, especially over his fabled consumption of alcohol. He welcomes being attacked as a drinker 'because I always think it's a sign of victory when they move on to the [[ad hominem]].' He drank, he said, 'because it makes other people less boring. I have a great terror of being bored. But I can work with or without it. It takes quite a lot to get me to slur.'"<ref>Oliver Burkeman, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1933179,00.html ''War of words''], [[The Guardian]], 28 October 2006</ref>

In his 2010 memoir ''Hitch-22'', Hitchens wrote: "There was a time when I could reckon to outperform all but the most hardened imbibers, but I now drink relatively carefully." He described his then-current drinking routine on working-days as follows: "At about half past midday, a decent slug of [[Johnnie Walker|Mr. Walker's amber restorative]], cut with [[Perrier]] water (an ideal delivery system) and no ice. At luncheon, perhaps half a bottle of red wine: not always more but never less. Then back to the desk, and ready to repeat the treatment at the evening meal. No 'after dinner drinks'—most especially nothing sweet and never, ever any brandy. 'Nightcaps' depend on how well the day went, but always the mixture as before. No mixing: no messing around with a gin here and a vodka there."<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2255781 ''A Short Footnote on the Grape and the Grain''], ''Slate'', 6 June 2010</ref>

Reflecting on the lifestyle that supported his career as a writer he said:
<blockquote>I always knew there was a risk in the bohemian lifestyle&nbsp;... I decided to take it because it helped my concentration, it stopped me being bored—it stopped other people being boring. It would make me want to prolong the conversation and enhance the moment. If you ask: would I do it again? I would probably say yes. But I would have quit earlier hoping to get away with the whole thing. I decided all of life is a wager and I'm going to wager on this bit&nbsp;... In a strange way I don't regret it. It's just impossible for me to picture life without wine, and other things, fueling the company, keeping me reading, energising me. It worked for me. It really did.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?297586-1/qa-christopher-hitchens|title=Q & A|publisher=Q-and-a.org|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>

==Final illness and death==
[[File:Hitchens 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Hitchens in 2010]]

In June 2010, Hitchens was on tour in New York promoting his memoirs ''Hitch-22'' when he was taken into emergency care suffering from a severe [[pericardial effusion]] and then announced he was postponing his tour to undergo treatment for [[esophageal cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://furiouspurpose.me/hitchens-has-his-voice-back/|title=Hitchens has his voice back|date=16 June 2011|work=furiouspurpose.me|accessdate=12 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2010/06/rs-_hitchens.html|title=Reliable Source&nbsp;– Christopher Hitchens diagnosed with cancer, cuts short his book tour|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref> He announced that he was undergoing treatment in a ''Vanity Fair'' piece entitled "Topic of Cancer".<ref name="Topic of Cancer"/> Hitchens said that he recognised the long-term prognosis was far from positive, and that he would be a "very lucky person to live another five years".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/08/hitchens-talks-to-goldblog-about-cancer-and-god/61072/|title=Hitchens Talks to Goldblog About Cancer and God|first=Jeffrey|last=Goldberg|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=17 September 2010|work=The Atlantic}}</ref>

During his illness, Hitchens was under the care of [[Francis Collins]] and was the subject of Collins's new cancer treatment, which maps out the [[human genome]] and selectively targets damaged [[DNA]].<ref name="Collins1">{{cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1370145/Atheist-Christopher-Hitchens-turns-evangelical-Christian-doctor-fight-cancer.html|title=Atheist Christopher Hitchens turns to evangelical Christian doctor in his fight against cancer|work=Daily Mail|location=UK|quote=Dr Francis Collins, the former director of the National Human Genome Research Project was one part of the team which developed techniques to map out the entire human DNA make-up is using Hitchens as a guinea pig for a new treatment.

In April 2011, Hitchens was forced to cancel an appearance at the [[American Atheist]] Convention, and instead sent a letter that stated, "Nothing would have kept me from joining you except the loss of my voice (at least my speaking voice) which in turn is due to a long argument I am currently having with the specter of death." He closed with "And don't keep the faith."<ref name="science">Scienceblogs.com article: "[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/04/hitchens_address_to_american_a.php Hitchens's address to American Atheists]."</ref> The letter also dismissed the notion of a possible deathbed conversion, in which he claimed that "redemption and supernatural deliverance appears even more hollow and artificial to me than it did before."<ref name="science" />

Hitchens died on 15 December 2011 at the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Laurence|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-16/christopher-hitchens-who-wrote-of-war-god-cancer-battle-dies-aged-62.html|title=Christopher Hitchens, Who Wrote of War, God, Cancer Battle, Dies Aged 62|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=16 December 2011|date=16 December 2011}}</ref> According to [[Andrew Sullivan]], his last words were "Capitalism.

Hitchens wrote a book-length work about his last illness, based on his ''Vanity Fair'' columns. "Mortality" was published in September 2012.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hek734KWP8wC&dq=Mortality+by+Christopher+Hitchens&source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Mortality by Christopher Hitchens|publisher=Twelve Books|date=21 June 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mortality|author=Christopher Hitchens|isbn=978-0-7710-3922-5|year=2012}}</ref>

==Reactions to Hitchens's death==
[[File:Hitchens Blair.jpg|alt=|thumb|Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Hitchens at the Munk debate on religion, Toronto, November 2010]]
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, "Christopher Hitchens was a complete one-off, an amazing mixture of writer, journalist, polemicist, and unique character. He was fearless in the pursuit of truth and any cause in which he believed. And there was no belief he held that he did not advocate with passion, commitment, and brilliance. He was an extraordinary, compelling and colourful human being whom it was a privilege to know."<ref name="WTimes">[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/16/quotes-on-the-death-of-pundit-christopher-hitchens/ Quotes on the death of pundit Christopher Hitchens]. Associated Press. 16 December 2011. Retrieved 22 July 2013.</ref>

[[Richard Dawkins]], British [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and a friend of Hitchens, said, "I think he was one of the greatest orators of all time. He was a polymath, a wit, immensely knowledgeable, and a valiant fighter against all tyrants, including imaginary supernatural ones."<ref name="WTimes"/>

American [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]], also a friend of Hitchens, said, "Christopher was a beacon of knowledge and light in a world that constantly threatens to extinguish both. He had the courage to accept the world for just what it is and not what he wanted it to be. That's the highest praise, I believe, one can give to any intellect. He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning only to the extent that we give them meaning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644326-remembering-christopher-hitchens|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120424194902/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/644326-remembering-christopher-hitchens|title=Remembering Christopher Hitchens|archivedate=24 April 2012|work=archive.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atheistfoundation.org.au/lawrence-krauss-tribute-to-christopher-hitchens/|title=Lawrence Krauss’ tribute to Christopher Hitchens|work=Atheist Foundation of Australia Inc}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ImIziEINXI|title=Lawrence Krauss – Christopher Hitchens Tribute|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atheistmedia.com/2012/05/lawrence-krauss-christopher-hitchens.html|title=Lawrence Krauss – Christopher Hitchens Tribute – 2012 Global Atheist Convention – Atheist Media Blog|work=atheistmedia.com}}</ref>
