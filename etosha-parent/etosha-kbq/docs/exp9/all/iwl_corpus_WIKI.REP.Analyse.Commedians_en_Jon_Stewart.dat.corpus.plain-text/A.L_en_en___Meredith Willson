'''Robert Meredith Willson''' (May 18, 1902 – June 15, 1984) was an [[United States|American]] [[composer]], [[songwriter]], [[flutist]], [[conducting|conductor]] and [[playwright]], best known for writing the book, music and lyrics for the hit [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Music Man]]''. He wrote three other Broadway musicals, composed symphonies and popular songs, and his film scores were twice nominated for [[Academy Awards]].

==Early life==
Willson was born in [[Mason City, Iowa]], to John David Willson and Rosalie Reiniger Willson, and he had a brother two years his senior, John Cedrick, and a sister 12 years his senior, the children's author, [[Dixie Willson]].<ref>[http://www.visitmasoncityiowa.com/html/mw_timeline.htm "Meredith Willson Biographical Timeline"]. Visitmasoncityiowa.com, accessed October 12, 2010</ref>  He attended Frank Damrosch's Institute of Musical Art (later the [[Juilliard School]]) in New York City.  He married his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth "Peggy" Wilson on August 29, 1920.<!-- Should this be Willson, or was her maiden name Wilson? added on 11/14/10-her maiden name was Wilson per ref--><ref name=film>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/3/Meredith-Willson.html Meredith Willson Biography (1902-1984)] filmreference.com, accessed December 15, 2008</ref> A [[flute]] and [[piccolo]] player, Willson was a member of [[John Philip Sousa]]'s band (1921–1923), and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1924–1929).  Willson then moved to [[San Francisco, California]], as the concert director for radio station [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]], and then as a musical director for the [[NBC]] radio network in [[Hollywood]].<ref>[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/willson.html San Francisco Museum listing]</ref>

During [[World War II]], he worked for the United States' [[Armed Forces Radio Service]].  His work with the [[Armed Forces Radio Service|AFRS]] teamed him with [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]] and [[Bill Goodwin]]. He would work with all three as the bandleader, and a regular character, on the [[Burns and Allen]] radio program.  He played a shy man, always trying to get advice on women.  His character was dizzy as well, basically a male version of [[Gracie Allen]]'s character.

In 1942, Willson had his own program on [[NBC]]. ''Meredith Willson's Music'' was a summer replacement for ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=On The Air|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/2148817/nelson_case_cap_activity/|agency=The Circleville Herald|date=June 19, 1942|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = April 6, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>

Returning to network radio after WWII, he created the Talking People, a choral group that spoke in unison while delivering radio commercials.  He also became the musical director for ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'', a prestigious comedy-variety program hosted by actress [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and featuring some of the world's most respected entertainers.  Willson himself became part of one of the show's very few running gags, beginning replies to Bankhead's comments or questions with, "Well, sir, Miss Bankhead...."  Willson wrote the song, "[[May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You]]" for the show.  Bankhead spoke the lyrics over the music at the end of each show.  He also worked on [[Jack Benny]]'s radio program, and hosted his own program in 1949. For a few years in the early 1950s, Willson was a regular panelist on the Goodson-Todman game show ''[[The Name's the Same]]''.

In 1950 Willson served as Musical Director for ''The California Story'', the Golden State's centennial production at the Hollywood Bowl. Through working on this production, Willson met writer [[Franklin Lacey]] who proved instrumental in developing the story line for a musical Willson had been working on, soon to be known as ''The Music Man''. ''The California Story'' spectacular was followed by two more state centennial collaborations with stage director [[Vladimir Rosing]]: ''The Oregon Story'' in 1959 and ''The Kansas Story'' in 1961.

==Broadway==
[[Image:Music Man Willson.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1959 recording of history and songs from ''[[The Music Man]]'']]
Willson's most famous work, ''[[The Music Man]]'', premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1957, and was adapted twice for film (in [[The Music Man (1962 film)|1962]] and [[The Music Man (2003 film)|2003]]).  He referred to the show as "an Iowan's attempt to pay tribute to his home state".  It took Willson some eight years and thirty revisions to complete the musical, for which he wrote more than forty songs.  The cast recording of ''The Music Man'' won the first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album|Best Original Cast Album (Broadway or TV)]].  In 1959, Willson and his wife Rini recorded an album called "...and Then I Wrote The Music Man", in which they review the history of, and sing songs from, the show (album cover shown at right).<ref>[http://castalbums.org/recordings/and-Then-I-Wrote-The-Music-Man-1959-Studio-Cast/1633 "...and Then I Wrote The Music Man"]. Castalbums.org, accessed August 10, 2011</ref>  In 2010, [[Brian d'Arcy James]] and [[Kelli O'Hara]] played Willson and Rini in an off-Broadway entertainment based on this album.<ref>Haun, Harry.

His third Broadway musical was an adaptation of the film ''[[Miracle On 34th Street]]'', called ''[[Here's Love]]'' (1963). His fourth, last, and least successful musical was ''[[1491 (musical)|1491]]'', which told the story of Columbus's attempts to finance his famous voyage. It was produced by the [[Los Angeles]] Civic Light Opera Association in 1969, but was never produced on Broadway.<ref>Suskin, Steven.

===Television specials===
In 1964, Meredith Willson produced three original summer variety specials for CBS under the title ''Texaco Star Parade.''

===Popular songs===
Willson penned a number of very well known songs, such as "You and I", which was a No. 1 for [[Glenn Miller]] in 1941 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. It was also recorded by [[Bing Crosby]], and by [[Tommy Dorsey]] with [[Frank Sinatra]] on vocals.

Three songs from ''The Music Man'' have become American standards: "[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]", "Gary Indiana", and "[[Till There Was You]]." The last was recorded by [[The Beatles]] for their albums ''[[With The Beatles]]'' (UK release, 1963) and ''[[Meet The Beatles!]]'' (US release, 1964).

He also wrote the fight song for his hometown high school "Mason City, Go!" He honored [[The Salvation Army]] with a musical tribute, "Banners and Bonnets".

An oddity in Willson's body of work is "[[Chicken Fat (song)|Chicken Fat]]", written in 1962. In school gymnasiums across the nation, this was the theme song for President John F. Kennedy's youth fitness program.<ref name=JFKPE>{{cite web| title= The Federal Government Takes on Physical Fitness | publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum | url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Physical-Fitness.aspx?p=2 | page=2 |accessdate= 4 June 2014}}</ref><ref>Oates, p. 164</ref> It was time to get the country's youth into shape, and Willson's song had youngsters moving through basic exercises at a frenetic pace: push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, torso twists, running in place, pogo springs, and plenty of marching. With an energetic lead vocal by [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]],<ref name=JFKPE /> orchestral marching band, and full chorus, it was likely recorded during sessions for the ''Music Man'' film. Two versions of the song exist: a three minute, radio-friendly length; and a longer, six minute version for use in the gymnasium.<ref name=JFKPE /> In 2014 "Chicken Fat" was used in a television commercial for the [[iPhone 5S]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/13/chicken_fat_song_apple_iphone_5s_commercial_uses_kennedy_era_exercise_anthem.html|title=Chicken Fat song: Apple iPhone 5s commercial uses Kennedy-era exercise anthem|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|publisher=Slate.com|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 1974 he offered a marching song, "Whip Inflation Now", to the [[Ford Administration]], but it was not used.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5gJoqTDzoIwC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=wilson+whip+inflation+now+march&source=bl&ots=hvnqdr73TY&sig=N9kFVBcuHhkeb-7I8_qNmX3MKj4&hl=en&ei=Lc3GTqrOC4zirAfbkozDDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false "Strictly Right: William F.

==Personal life==
[[File:Meredith Willson Star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6411 Hollywood Blvd.]]
Willson was married three times. After divorcing first wife Elizabeth, he married  Ralina "Rini" Zarova on March 13, 1948.  Following her December 6, 1966 death, he married Rosemary Sullivan in February 1968.<ref name=film/><ref>Oates, p. 170</ref><ref>Greasley, Philip A. (2001), ''Dictionary of Midwestern Literature'', p. 536, Indiana University Press, ISBN 0-253-33609-0</ref>  He lived for years in the [[Mandeville Canyon]] section of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, California]], and was fondly remembered by friends and neighbors as a warm and gregarious host who loved nothing more than to play the piano and sing at parties. He often gave out autographed copies of his record album, ''Meredith Willson Sings Songs from The Music Man''. In 1982, both he and Rosemary appeared in the audience of ''The Lawrence Welk Show''.

Willson returned several times to his home town for the North Iowa Band Festival,<ref>[http://nibandfest.com The North Iowa Band Festival]</ref> an annual event celebrating music with a special emphasis on marching bands. Mason City was the site of the 1962 premiere of the motion picture ''The Music Man'', hosted by Iowa Governor [[Norman Erbe]], which was timed to coincide with the festival. Willson, like his character Harold Hill, led the "Big Parade" through the town, and the event included special appearances by stars of the film [[Shirley Jones]] and [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  The Master of Ceremonies was [[W. Earl Hall]], editor of the Mason City ''Globe-Gazette'', state wide radio personality and friend of many decades. Willson was a member of the National Honorary Band Fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]].

From about 1948 to the end of his life he was an active member, a deacon, of Westwood Hills Congregational Church in Los Angeles.  He donated a stained glass window, known as "The Music Man Window", above the pew where he would sit, which represented various musical instruments.  He drove a Rolls Royce to church.  He composed hymns for the church, including: "Anthem of the Atomic Age" in 1953.  He and the pastor, who was also from Northeastern Iowa, were very close friends.

Willson died of heart failure in 1984 at the age of 82.  He is buried at the Elmwood Saint Joseph Cemetery in Mason City, Iowa.
