'''Claudette Colbert''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛər}}; 13 September 1903 – 30 July 1996) was a French-born<!--Colbert's mother was of British ancestry. She grew up in Manhattan and was already naturalized in the United States in 1912. Nationality should be based on "when the person became notable" per WP:MOSBIO--> American actress, and a leading lady for two decades.

Colbert began her career in [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] productions during the 1920s, progressing to film with the advent of [[talking pictures]]. Initially associated with [[Paramount Pictures]],  Colbert later gradually shifted to working as a freelance actor. She won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), the first woman born outside of [[North America]] to do so, and also received Academy Award nominations for ''[[Private Worlds]]'' (1935) and ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944). With her round apple-face,<ref name="tcmdb"/> Colbert was known as an expert [[screwball comedy|screwball comedienne]],<ref name="DiBattista, p. 210"/> but her dramatic range enabled her to easily encompass melodrama and to play characters ranging from vamps to housewives.<ref name="Pace" /> During her career, Colbert starred in more than sixty movies.  She was the industry's biggest box-office star in 1938 and 1942.<ref name="Pace"/>

By the mid 1950s, she had largely retired from the screen in favor of television and stage work, earning a [[Tony Award]] nomination for ''[[The Marriage-Go-Round]]'' in 1959. Her career tapered off during the early 1960s, but in the late 1970s she experienced a career resurgence in theater, earning a [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her Chicago theater work in 1980. For her television work in ''[[The Two Mrs. Grenvilles]]'' (1987) she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] and received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]] nomination.

In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] voted Colbert the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|"12th Greatest Female American Screen Legend"]] in cinema.

Marie Loew had already been to the U.S., and Georges' brother-in-law (surname Vedel) was already living in New York City.

Colbert studied at [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] (known for having a strong arts program), where her speech teacher, Alice Rossetter, encouraged her to audition for a play Rossetter had written.

==Breakthrough==
[[File:Claudette Colbert in I Cover the Waterfront 2.jpg|thumb|Colbert in ''[[I Cover the Waterfront]]'', 1933]]
In 1928, Colbert signed a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]],<ref name="tcmdb"/> which was looking for stage actors who could handle dialogue in the new "talkies" medium.

She co-starred with [[Fredric March]] in ''[[Manslaughter (1930 film)|Manslaughter]]'' (1930), receiving critical acclaim<ref>Quirk, p. 64 citing ''The New York Times''.</ref> for her performance as a woman charged with [[vehicular manslaughter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v101560 |work=All Movie Guide |title=Manslaughter |author=Hal Erickson |accessdate=2013-02-11}}</ref> She was paired with March in four productions, including ''[[Honor Among Lovers]]'' (1931) with [[Ginger Rogers]].

Colbert was reluctant to appear as the "runaway heiress" Ellie Andrews in the [[Frank Capra]] romantic comedy ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934). Running behind schedule after several actresses had refused the role, the studio accepted Colbert's demand that she be paid $50,000 and that filming was to be completed within four weeks to allow her to take a planned vacation. Throughout the filming, Colbert felt that the script was weak,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hirschnor |first=Joel |year=1983 |title=Rating the Movie Stars for Home Video, TV and Cable |publisher=Publications International Limited |ISBN=0-88176-152-4 |page=87}}</ref> and Capra claimed Colbert "had many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me"; however, "she was wonderful in the part."<ref>{{cite news |last=Pace |first=Eric |date=1996-07-31 |title=Claudette Colbert, Unflappable Heroine of Screwball Comedies, is Dead at 92 |work=The New York Times |page=4 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/movies/claudette-colbert-unflappable-heroine-of-screwball-comedies-is-dead-at-92.html?pagewanted=4&src=pm}}</ref> After filming was completed, Colbert complained to her friend, "I just finished the worst picture in the world."<ref name=Pace/><ref>[http://www.moviediva.com/MD_root/reviewpages/MDItHappenedOneNight.htm "It Happened One Night."] ''moviediva.com''.

But after it was released to secondary movie houses, word-of-mouth began to spread and ticket sales became brisk.

==Widespread recognition==
[[File:It's a Wonderful World trailer.jpg|thumb|Colbert in ''It's a Wonderful World,'' 1939]]
Colbert's success allowed her to renegotiate her contract, raising her salary. In 1935 and 1936, she was listed in the annual "Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money-Making Stars," which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the U.S. for the stars who had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.<ref name ="Quigley">{{cite web | url = http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html | title = The 2006 Motion Picture Almanac, Top Ten Money Making Stars |work= Quigley Publishing Company | accessdate = 2006-08-18 }}</ref> Then she received an Academy Award nomination for her role in the hospital drama ''[[Private Worlds]]'' (1935).

[[File:Claudette colbert.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo, c. 1940s]]
In addition to Lubitsch, DeMille and Capra, Colbert was working with the top directors in the industry: [[Dorothy Arzner]], [[Preston Sturges]], [[Frank Lloyd]], [[John M. Stahl]], [[Wesley Ruggles]], [[Gregory La Cava]], [[George Cukor]], [[Mitchell Leisen]], and [[John Ford]].

Colbert was a stickler regarding the way she appeared on screen. She believed that her face was difficult to light and photograph, and was obsessed with not showing the right side of her face to the camera, because of a small bump resulting from a childhood broken nose.<ref>Helen Dudar, "Claudette Colbert Revels in a Happy, Starry Past," The New York Times, 27 October 1991, p. A-1</ref> She refused to be filmed from the right side of her face, and this often necessitated redesigning movie sets.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hal Erickson |title=biography |work=allmovie  |url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p14003}}</ref> Film technicians described the right side of her face as "the dark side of the moon."<ref name="ShipmanMovieTalk" /> During the filming of ''[[Tovarich (film)|Tovarich]]'' in 1937, one of her favored cameramen was dismissed by the director, [[Anatole Litvak]]. After seeing the rushes filmed by the replacement, Colbert refused to continue. She insisted on hiring her own cameraman, and offered to waive her salary if the film went over budget as a result.<ref name="Shipman115" /> [[Gary Cooper]] was terrified at the prospect of working with Colbert in his first comedy, ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' (1938), because he considered Colbert to be an expert in the genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Niven |first=David |year=1976 |title=Bring on the Empty Horses |publisher=Putnam |ISBN=0-399-11542-0 |page=286}}</ref> She learned about lighting and cinematography, and refused to begin filming until she was satisfied that she would be shown to her best advantage.<ref name="KDL_p119">{{cite book |author=Kotsilibas-Davis and Loy, Myrna |year=1988 |title=Being and Becoming |publisher=Donald I.

In 1940, Colbert refused a seven-year contract that would have paid her $200,000 a year, after finding out that she could command a fee of $150,000 per film as a freelance artist. With her manager, Colbert was able to secure roles in prestigious films, and this period marked the height of her earning ability.<ref name="Shipman115" /> Colbert once said that ''[[Arise, My Love]]'' (1940) was her favorite film.<ref name = Panache>{{cite web | url = http://www.meredy.com/claudettecolbert/bio.htm |title = Claudette Colbert – Pure Panache – Biography |accessdate = 2007-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.leninimports.com/claudette_colbert.html |title = Claudette Colbert Biography (1903–1996) – Lenin Imports |accessdate = 2007-11-25}}</ref>

During filming of ''[[So Proudly We Hail!]]'' (1943), a rift occurred between Colbert and co-star [[Paulette Goddard]]. Asked which of her co-stars she preferred, Goddard had replied, "Veronica, I think," referring to [[Veronica Lake]]. Goddard further commented that Colbert "flipped" and "was at [my] eyes at every moment," and said that they continued their feud throughout the duration of filming.<ref name="ShipmanMovieTalk"/> Colbert was otherwise known for maintaining particularly high standards of professionalism during shooting.<ref name="The Claudette Colbert Business"/> Impressed by Colbert's role in ''So Proudly We Hail!,'' [[David O. Selznick]] approached her to play the lead role in ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944). She was initially reluctant to appear as a mother of teenaged children, but Selznick eventually overcame her sensitivity.<ref>Haver, pp. 338–340.</ref> Released in June 1944, the film proved a substantial success and grossed almost $5 million in the United States.

==After World War II==
In 1945, Colbert ended her association with Paramount Studios, and continued to freelance in such films as ''[[Guest Wife]]'' (1945) with [[Don Ameche]].

In 1949, she was originally cast in ''[[All About Eve]],'' because producer [[Joseph L.

However, Colbert severely injured her back, which led her to abandon the picture shortly before filming began. In later life, Colbert said, "I just never had the luck to play bitches."<ref name="Obituary"/>

For tax reasons<ref name="A Perfect Star"/> Colbert traveled to Europe, making fewer films in the early 1950s. She appeared in ''[[Royal Affairs in Versailles]]'' with [[Orson Welles]], the only film in which she acted for a French director, although <!--For "Daughters of Destiny", Colbert worked with Italian director-->Colbert had only a supporting role rather than top billing.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.altfg.com/blog/best-films-of/best-films-of-1954/ |title=Best Films&nbsp;– 1954 |first=Andre |last=Soares |date=January 12, 2005 |work=Alternative Film Guide}}</ref> This film was screened in the United States in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |title=Release dates for ''Royal Affairs in Versailles'' |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047484/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt |accessdate=2013-04-21 |work=IMDb}}</ref>

[[File:Claudette Colbert 1959.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo, 1959]]
In 1954 Colbert turned down a million-dollar broadcast deal with NBC-TV,<ref name="A Perfect Star">{{cite news |title=A Perfect Star |work=Vanity Fair |date=January 1998 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/a-perfect-star-199801}}</ref> but made a pact with CBS-TV to star in several [[teleplay]]s. After a successful appearance in a television version of ''[[The Royal Family]],''<ref name="tcmdb"/> she began acting in various television programs. From 1954 to 1960, she starred in [[television movie|television adaptations]] of ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' in 1956 and ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' in 1959. She also guest starred on ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents]],'' ''[[Playhouse 90]],'' and ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater|Zane Grey Theater]].''

In 1958, she returned to Broadway in ''[[The Marriage-Go-Round]]," for which she was nominated for a Best Actress [[Tony Award]].

She made a brief return to the screen in ''[[Parrish (film)|Parrish]]'' (1961), playing the supporting role of the mother, which received little attention from the press. After that, Colbert instructed her agent to stop his attempts to generate interest in her as a film actress, because there had been no offers.<ref name="Shipman117">Shipman, ''The Great Movie Stars,'' p. 117.</ref>

Her occasional successful acting ventures were appearances on Broadway in ''The Irregular Verb to Love'' (1963); ''The Kingfisher'' (1978) in which she co-starred with [[Rex Harrison]]; and [[Frederick Lonsdale]]'s ''[[Aren't We All?]]'' (1985), also with Rex Harrison.

In 1987, Colbert appeared in a supporting role in the television [[miniseries]] ''[[The Two Mrs. Grenvilles]].'' The production was a ratings success. Colbert won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television|Golden Globe]] and received a nomination for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress-Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]].

Modern critics have pointed out that Colbert had a mixture of unique physical assets (her round apple-face,<ref name="tcmdb"/> big eyes, curly light hair,<ref name="Pace"/> slender body), an elegant voice, aristocratic manner, sleek acting, a tongue-in-cheek vivacity, witty sense of humor and ladylike alluring charm,<ref>{{cite book |author=James Robert Parish |title=The Paramount Pretties |publisher=Arlington House |location=New Rochelle NY |year=1972 |page=92}}</ref> that distinguishes her from other screwball comediennes of the 1930s such as [[Jean Arthur]] and [[Irene Dunne]].<ref name="The Claudette Colbert Business">{{cite web |title=Claudette Colbert Q&A Pt.1: ‘The Claudette Colbert Business’ |author=Andre Soares |date=Aug 12, 2011 |work=Alt Film Guide |url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/movie/claudette-colbert-paramount-the-claudette-colbert-business/}}</ref> In her comedy films, she invariably played shrewd and self-reliant women, but unlike many of her contemporaries, Colbert rarely engaged in physical comedy. Her characters were more likely to be observers and commentators.<ref name="DiBattista, p. 210">{{cite book |last=DiBattista |first=Maria |year=2001 |title=Fast Talking Dames |publisher=Yale University Press |ISBN=0-300-09903-7 |page=210}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1928, Colbert married [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]], an actor and director, with whom she co-starred in the Broadway show ''The Barker,'' and in the 1930 film ''[[Young Man of Manhattan]],'' for which he received negative reviews as one of her weakest leading men.<ref name="Shipman113"/> Their marriage remained a secret for many years while they lived in separate homes.<ref name="tcmdb">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/36555%7C32817/Claudette-Colbert/ |title=Claudette Colbert |accessdate=2013-02-09 |work=TCM}}</ref> In Los Angeles, Colbert shared a home with her mother Jeanne Chauchoin,<ref>{{cite web |title=Claudette Colbert Q&A Pt.3 |author=Andre Soares |work=Alt Film Guide |url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/movie/claudette-colbert-lesbian-the-two-mrs-grenvilles/ |date=Aug 12, 2011}}</ref> but her domineering mother disliked Foster and did not allow him into their home.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/10/03/ST2008100302864.html |title=Star Light, Star Bright |first=John |last=DiLeo |date=October 5, 2008 |page=BW08 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> Colbert and Foster divorced in 1935 in Mexico.<ref name="tcmdb"/> Writer Robert Shaw, a close friend of Colbert's later in her life, claimed that around this time the actress had an affair with [[Marlene Dietrich]], with whom she was photographed sliding down a chute at a Venice Beach amusement park.<ref name=mann />

Four months after her divorce, Colbert married Joel Pressman, a throat specialist and surgeon at [[UCLA]].<ref name="Pace" />  She gave a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] single-engine plane to Pressman as a present. They purchased a ranch in Northern California, where her husband kept [[show cattle]]. During this period, Colbert drove a [[Lincoln Continental]] and a [[Ford Thunderbird]].<ref name="A Perfect Star"/> The marriage lasted 33 years, until Pressman's death of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in 1968.

Jeanne Chauchoin envied her daughter's talents of art and acting, and never gave Colbert recognition for her success. Colbert spent many years of her life seeking Jeanne's approval.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/>  Jeanne let Colbert's brother Charles serve as Colbert's agent. Charles used the surname Wendling which was borrowed from Jeanne's paternal grandmother, Rose Wendling.<ref name="Lily of Saint-Mandé"/> Charles served as Colbert's business manager for a time,<ref name="Quirk 5" /> and was credited with negotiating some of her more lucrative contracts in the late 1930s and early 1940s.<ref name="Shipman113"/>

Colbert was generally respected for her professionalism, and the ''New York Times'' stated that she was known for giving "110 percent" to any project she worked on.<ref name="Shipman115" /> [[Hedda Hopper]] wrote that Colbert placed her career "ahead of everything save possibly her marriage," with a strong sense of what was best for her, and a "deep-rooted desire to be in shape, efficient and under control." <ref name="ShipmanMovieTalk" /> The writer [[A. Scott Berg]] remarked that Colbert had "helped define femininity for her generation with her chic manner."<ref name="Berg_p190">{{cite book |last=Berg |first=A. Scott |year=1989 |title=Goldwyn |publisher=Sphere Books. |ISBN=0-7474-0593-X |page=190}}</ref>  Colbert once said, "I’ve been in the Claudette Colbert business a long time."<ref name="The Claudette Colbert Business"/>

In 1954, her aunt Emilie Loew died in the U.S.<ref name="Lily of Saint-Mandé"/> Although virtually retired from the motion-picture industry since the mid-1950s, Colbert was still financially solvent enough to maintain an upscale lifestyle. Despite already having a country house in [[Palm Springs]] for staying on weekends, she rented a cottage in [[Cap Ferrat]] in southeastern France. Adman Peter Rogers said, "Claudette was extravagant; I never, ever saw her question the price of anything." In 1963, Colbert sold her residence in [[Holmby Hills]] (western Los Angeles), so Joel Pressman rented a small house in Beverly Hills.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/>

There has been speculation by some in Hollywood that Colbert was bisexual, because of her special friendship with the lesbian artist, Verna Hull, but Colbert and her closest friends have denied such a claim.<ref>{{cite web|title=Claudette Colbert|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/a-perfect-star-199801f|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}</ref> Portrait artist [[Don Bachardy]] has written that she was referred to as "Uncle Claude:" "I think she's a really good example of a very closeted situation. Only well within her own circle did they know the truth."<ref name=mann /> In 1958 she met Verna Hull, a wealthy painter/photographer and the stepdaughter of a [[Sears Roebuck]] heiress. They had a nine-year friendship and painted together, went for drives together, traveled together and even rented twin penthouses in New York. They had a mutual interest in art. When Colbert bought a house in Barbados in the early 1960s, Hull also bought a modest house next door. The friendship ended suddenly when, as Colbert's husband lay dying, Hull warned Colbert that he might at any moment try to kill her to take her with him when he died. Offended, Colbert announced that she would never see Hull or speak with her again.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/> An article in Vanity Fair explains that Hull had warned Colbert that people "would talk" if they were friends, and would suggest that Colbert might be gay. Colbert reportedly laughed off the suggestion, and was secure enough in herself to not be persuaded by others' views.

For years, Colbert divided her time between her apartment in Manhattan and her vacation home in [[Speightstown]], [[Barbados]].<ref name="Pace" /> The latter, purchased from a British gentleman and nicknamed "Bellerive," was the island’s only plantation house fronting the beach.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/> However, her permanent address remained Manhattan. Later in life, she was also a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and natural conservative.<ref>{{cite news |author=Derek Granger |title=Obituary: Claudette Colbert |date=1996-08-02 |work=The (London) Independent}}</ref>

Colbert's mother Jeanne died in 1970 and her brother Charles died in 1971,<ref name="tcmdb"/> so her only surviving relative was a niece, Coco Lewis, Charles' daughter.<ref name="Obituary">{{cite news |title=Oscar-Winner Claudette Colbert dead at 92 |work=Tributes.com |url=http://www.tributes.com/show/Claudette-Colbert-83730381 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Perfect Star |date=January 1998 |work=Vanity Fair |author=Amy Fine Collins}}</ref>

Following a series of small strokes during the last three years of her life, Colbert died in 1996 at her second home in Barbados,<ref name="Pace"/> where she was employing one housekeeper and two cooks. Colbert’s body was shipped to New York for cremation.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/> A requiem mass was later held at St. Vincent Ferrer church in New York City.<ref name="Envoi">{{cite book |title=Claudette Colbert: She Walked in Beauty |year=2008 |first= Bernard F. |last=Dick |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |chapter=Chapter 17. Envoi}}</ref> Her ashes were buried in the Godings Bay Church Cemetery, Speightstown, [[Saint Peter, Barbados]],<ref>{{Find a Grave|22371}}</ref> along with her mother and second husband.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/>

The childless Colbert left most of her estate, estimated at $3.5 million and also including her Manhattan apartment and Bellerive, to a long-time friend, Helen O'Hagan, a retired director of corporate relations at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], whom Colbert had met in 1961 on the set of ''[[Parrish (film)|Parrish]],'' her last film<ref>Stephanie Harvin, "O'Hagan, a Legend at Saks," Post and Courier, 23 August 1996</ref><ref>"Colbert's Will Provides for Longtime Friends,"  Austin American-Statesman, 10 August 1996, page B12</ref> and became best friends with around 1970.<ref name="tcmdb"/> After the death of Pressman, Colbert instructed her friends to treat O'Hagan as they had Pressman, "as her spouse."<ref name=mann>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=William J.|title=Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910–1969|year=2001|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0670030171|pages=81–82}}</ref>  Though O'Hagan was financially comfortable without the generous bequest, Bellerive was sold for over $2 million to [[David Geffen]]. Colbert's remaining assets were distributed among three heirs: $150,000 to her niece Coco Lewis; a trust worth more than $100,000 to UCLA for Pressman’s memory; and $75,000 to Marie Corbin, Colbert's Barbadian housekeeper.<ref name="A Perfect Star"/>
