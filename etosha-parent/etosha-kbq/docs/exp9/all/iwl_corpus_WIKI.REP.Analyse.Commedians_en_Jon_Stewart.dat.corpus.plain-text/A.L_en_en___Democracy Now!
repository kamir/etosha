==Background==
[[File:DCTV-DN-firehouse-800x600.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The show was located in the [[Downtown Community Television Center|DCTV]] firehouse building (a converted firehouse) in New York City's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].]]

''Democracy Now!'' was founded on February 19, 1996 at [[WBAI|WBAI-FM]] in New York City by progressive journalists [[Amy Goodman]], [[Juan Gonzalez (journalist)|Juan Gonzalez]], [[Larry Bensky]], [[Salim Muwakkil]], and Julie Drizin.<ref name=first_show>{{cite web | url=http://www.democracynow.org/shows/1996/2/19 | title=The First Democracy Now!

The Democracy Now! website is also available in Spanish. The program focuses on issues considered underreported or ignored by [[mainstream media|mainstream news coverage]]. ''Democracy Now!'' began broadcasting on television every weekday shortly after September 11, 2001, and is the only public media in the U.S. that airs simultaneously on satellite and cable television, radio, and the internet.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.democracynow.org/about/history | title=History & Highlights | publisher=Democracy Now! | accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref>

===Studios===
''Democracy Now!'' began as a radio program broadcast from the studios of [[WBAI]], a local [[Pacifica Radio]] station in [[New York City]]. In early September, 2001, amid a months-long debate over the mission and management of Pacifica, ''Democracy Now!'' was forced out of the WBAI studios. Goodman brought the program to the [[Downtown Community Television Center]] located in a converted firehouse building in New York City's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], where the program began to be televised.<ref name="Common Dreams">{{cite web|last1=Ratner|first1=Lizzy|title=Amy Goodman's 'Empire' How a prospective biochemist became a muckraker and champion of media reform|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0506-22.htm|website=http://www.commondreams.org|publisher=Common Dreams|accessdate=23 July 2014|date=May 6, 2005}}</ref><ref name="Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez">{{cite web|title=Farewell to the Firehouse: After 8 Years at Downtown Community Television Landmark, Democracy Now!

==2008 Republican National Convention arrests==
Three journalists with ''Democracy Now!''—including principal host [[Amy Goodman]], and news producers Nicole Salazar and [[Sharif Abdel Kouddous]]—were detained by police during their reporting on the [[2008 Republican National Convention Protest|2008 Republican National Convention protests]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/352466/amy_goodman_others_detained_outside_rnc|title=Amy Goodman, Others Detained Outside RNC |date=September 1, 2008|work=[[The Nation]]|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Salazar was filming as officers in full [[riot gear]] charged her area. As she yelled "Press!" she was knocked down and told to put her face in the ground while another officer dragged her backward by her leg across the pavement. The video footage of the incident was immediately posted on the Internet, leading to a large public outcry against her arrest. When a second producer, Kouddous, approached, he too was arrested, and charged with a [[felony]]. According to a press release by ''Democracy Now!'', Goodman herself was arrested after confronting officers regarding the arrest of her colleagues. The officers had established a line of "crowd control," and ordered Goodman to move back. Goodman claims she was arrested after being pulled through the police line by an officer, and subsequently (as well as Kouddous) had her press credentials for the convention physically stripped from her by a [[secret service]] agent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/09/democracy-now-host-and-produce.html|title=Democracy Now!
