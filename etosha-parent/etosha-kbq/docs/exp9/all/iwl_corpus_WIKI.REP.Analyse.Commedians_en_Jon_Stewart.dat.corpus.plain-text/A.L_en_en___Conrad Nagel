'''Conrad Nagel''' ({{Birth date|1897|3|16|mf=y}} &ndash; {{Death date|1970|2|24|mf=y}})<ref name="Silent">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uznsDu6OHA0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA263#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | author=Slide, Anthony | year=2010 | pages=263}}</ref> was an [[Cinema of the United States|American screen]] [[actor]] and matinee idol of the [[silent film]] era and beyond. He was also a well-known television actor and radio performer.
<!--spacing, please do not remove-->

==Early Life==
Born in [[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]], [[Iowa]],<ref name="Dispatch" /> into an upper-middle-class family, he was the son of a musician father, Frank, and a mother, Frances (née Murphy), who was a locally praised singer. Nagel's mother died early in his life, and he always attributed his artistic inclination to growing up in a family environment that encouraged self-expression. His father, Frank, became dean of the music conservatory at [[Des Moines College|Highland Park College]] and when Nagel was three, the family moved to Des Moines.

After graduating from [[Highland Park College]] at [[Des Moines, Iowa]], Nagel left for [[California]] to pursue a career in the relatively new medium of motion pictures where he garnered instant attention from the [[Hollywood]] studio executives. With his {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} frame, blue eyes, and wavy blond hair; the young, [[Midwestern]] Nagel was seen by studio executives as a potentially wholesome matinee idol whose unpretentious all-American charm would surely appeal to the nation's nascent film-goers.

==Film Career==

Nagel was immediately cast in film roles that cemented his ''unspoiled lover'' image. His first film was the 1918 retelling of the [[Louisa May Alcott]] classic, ''[[Little Women]]'', which quickly captured the public's attention and set Nagel on a path to silent film stardom. His breakout role came in the 1920 film, ''[[The Fighting Chance]]'', opposite [[Sweden|Swedish]] starlet [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].

In 1927, Nagel starred alongside [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]], [[Marceline Day]], [[Henry B. Walthall]] and [[Polly Moran]] in the now lost [[Tod Browning]] directed horror film, ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]''. The film is quite possibly the most famous [[lost film]] ever.

Unlike so many silent films stars of the [[Roaring Twenties]], Conrad Nagel had little difficulty transitioning to [[Sound film|talkies]] and spent the next several decades being very well received in high profile films as a character actor. He was also frequently heard on radio and made many notable appearances on television. From 1937 to 1947 he hosted and directed the radio program ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]''. From 1949 to 1952, he hosted the popular TV game show, ''[[Celebrity Time]]'' and from 1953 to 1954, the [[DuMont Television Network]] program ''[[Broadway to Hollywood]]''. In 1961 he made a guest appearance on ''[[Perry Mason]]'' as art collector and murderer Nathan Claver in "The Case of the Torrid Tapestry."

===AMPAS & SAG===

On May 11, 1927, Nagel was among 35 other film industry insiders to found the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS); a professional honorary organization dedicated to the advancement of the arts and sciences of motion pictures. Fellow actors involved in the founding included: [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Richard Barthelmess]], [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], [[Milton Sills]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]. He served as president of the organization from 1932 to 1933.<ref name="Silent" /> He was also a founding member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG).

Nagel was the host of the [[3rd Academy Awards]] ceremony held on November 5, 1930, the [[5th Academy Awards]] on November 18, 1932, and a co-host with [[Bob Hope]] at the [[25th Academy Awards]] ceremony on  March 19, 1953. The 21-year gap between his appearances in 1932 and 1953 is a record for an Oscar ceremonies host.

==Radio and television==
Nagel was the announcer for ''[[Alec Templeton|Alec Templeton Time]]'', a musical variety program on [[NBC Radio]] in the summer of 1939.<ref name="dunningota">Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-507678-3. P. 22.</ref> Templeton later hosted his own TV show ''[[It's Alec Templeton Time]]'' on the [[DuMont Television Network]] from June 1955 to August 1955.

From September 14, 1955 to June 1, 1956, Nagel hosted ''[[Hollywood Preview]]'', a 30-minute show on the DuMont Television Network which featured Hollywood stars with clips of upcoming films.<ref>[http://ctva.biz/US/TalkShow/HollywoodPreview.htm CTVA entry]</ref>

==Personal Life==

Nagel married and divorced three times.<ref name="Dispatch">{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19700225&id=co0bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UVEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6851,4024219 | title=Old-Time Star Conrad Nagel Found Dead | publisher=The Dispatch (Lexington, North Carolina) | date=25 February 1970 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=UPI | pages=13}}</ref> His first wife, actress Ruth Helms, gave birth to a daughter, Ruth Margaret, in 1920. His second wife was actress [[Lynn Merrick]]. His third wife was Michael Coulson Smith, who gave birth to a son Michael in the late 1950s.

In 1970, Nagel died in [[New York City]],<ref name="Dispatch" /> aged 72, and was cremated at [[Garden State Crematory]] in [[North Bergen, New Jersey]]. Nagel's remains are interred at the Lutheran Cemetery in Warsaw, Illinois.

==Awards and honors==

In 1940, Nagel was given an [[Honorary Academy Award]] for his work with the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]]. For his contributions to film, radio, and television, Conrad Nagel was given three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1719 Vine Street (motion pictures), 1752 Vine Street (radio), and 1752 Vine Street (television).
