'''Lawrenceville''' is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) and [[Local government in New Jersey#Unincorporated communities|unincorporated community]] located within [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]] in [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]], [[New Jersey]], United States.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-32.pdf New Jersey: 2010 - Population and Housing Unit Counts - 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH-2-32)], [[United States Census Bureau]], August 2012.

Lawrenceville is also known as the "village of Lawrenceville."<ref>[http://lhtrail.org/gallery/village-of-lawrenceville/ Village of Lawrenceville], Lawrence Hopewell Trail. Accessed November 21, 2012.</ref> Its core is the [[Lawrence Township Historic District|Main Street Historic District]], which was listed in the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places in 1972, one of the first registered historic districts in New Jersey.<ref name=History>[http://www.lawrencetwp.com/history-ms-1.html Main Street Historic District], Township of Lawrence. accessed November 21, 2012. "When listed in the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places in 1972, the Main Street Historic District was one of the first registered historic districts in the State."</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP had a total area of 1.043 square miles (2.701&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which, 1.042 square miles (2.698&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it was land and 0.001 square miles (0.002&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it (0.09%) was water.<ref name=CensusArea/><ref name="GR1">[http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990], [[United States Census Bureau]]. Accessed September 4, 2014.</ref>

[[U.S. Route 206]] changes its name from "Lawrenceville-Princeton Road" to "Main Street", and then to "Lawrenceville-Trenton Road" in the center of Lawrenceville. The local historic district fronts along Main Street and [[U.S. Route 206]] stretch for more than two miles between Franklin Corner Road and an area slightly north of Fackler Road. Homes situated more than 250 feet from the road are excluded, however. One exception is the section of The Lawrenceville School known as the Circle and several other buildings in its vicinity, the oldest buildings on the campus. This area itself has been designated a National Historic Landmark.<ref name=History/>

Lawrenceville generally comprises the area contained within Lawrenceville-Pennington Road to the south, Fackler Road to the north, Keefe Road to the west, and [[U.S. Route 206]], part of which turns into Main Street in Lawrenceville, to the east. The Lawrenceville School, across Route 206, is usually considered part of the village as well. Before tract development, beginning in the early 1970s, Lawrenceville was broadly defined as stretching two to three blocks back from Route 206. The boundary became less clear as residential developments replaced farmland behind the historic village.

Lawrence Township is occasionally and mistakenly referred to as Lawrenceville. The confusion is partly caused because the local post office is located in the Lawrenceville CDP and the Postal Service once instructed Lawrence Township residents to use Lawrenceville, Princeton or Trenton as their mailing address. In 1973, voters approved a nonbinding referendum to petition the U.S. Postal Service to adopt a single municipal post office address known as Lawrenceville for the entire township; The effort failed. A township resident appeared before Township Council in July, 2007, to request to designate the 08648 ZIP code for Lawrence Township. Council approved a resolution in support of the request that was then forwarded to the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]. Township officials had fought, off and on, for the change since 1969, when then-U.S. Rep. [[Frank Thompson]] tried unsuccessfully to convince U.S. Postal Service authorities to grant a Lawrence name tag for the entire township, according to a letter on file at the Municipal Clerk's Office.  The [[United States Postal Service]] notified the township authorities in October 2007 that the preferred designation for the 08648 would be changed to "Lawrence Township".<ref>[http://lawrencetwp.com/documents/PRESS%20RELEASE%20ZIP%20Code%20change%20_2_.pdf Lawrence Township Assigned ZIP Code Designation], Lawrence Township, October 31, 2007. Accessed November 19, 2012. "The United States Postal Service (USPS) has notified Lawrence Township Officials that the postal ZIP Code 08648 has been approved for designation as Lawrence Township."</ref>

Lawrenceville is equidistant between Trenton and Princeton, almost being equidistant from New York and Philadelphia, with it being roughly fifteen miles closer to Philadelphia. Major transportation corridors have passed through Lawrenceville since the town's inception, including The King's Highway, which in the 18th century approximated today's [[U.S. Route 206]].<ref>[http://www.lawrencetwp.com/history.html A Brief History of Lawrence Township], Township of Lawrence.

== History ==
Lawrenceville was founded as Maidenhead in 1697, as part of [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]] in the colony of [[West Jersey]]. In 1714, the village became a part of [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]]. In 1798, the [[New Jersey Legislature]] legally incorporated the Township of Maidenhead.

The name "Maidenhead" was adopted from an English town on the Thames River, about 20 miles from London. The Colonial Supreme Court at Burlington officially confirmed the name on February 20, 1697. "Maidenhead" derives from the Anglo Saxon word "Maidenhythe," meaning "new wharf", though it acquired a secondary meaning as a term for virginity.<ref>Pictorial History of Lawrence Township 1697-1997, published by Lawrence Township, 1997</ref>

The Rev. Issac V. Brown, the first full-time pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville and the founder of the Academy of Maidenhead (now the [[Lawrenceville School]]), led a movement to petition the Legislature to change the town's name. The petition said "... it must be the wish of every good citizen... to be relieved of the necessity of using a term which may offend the delicacy of modesty, or disturb the feelings of seriousness, or excite the sneers of the willing".<ref>Tyler, Donald H., Old Lawrenceville, 1973</ref>

The Legislature officially changed the name from Maidenhead to Lawrence on January 24, 1816, at a meeting in John Moore's Tavern. The township took its name from Captain [[James Lawrence]], a naval hero of the [[War of 1812]]. The village was renamed Lawrenceville at the same time. In 1838, [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]] was formed from parts of three counties, and Lawrence Township was included in the new County. The Township's boundaries and geographic relationships have remained the same since that time.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[George Washington]]'s troops marched through Maidenhead after the [[Battle of Trenton]] (December 26, 1776) and the [[Second Battle of Trenton]] (January 2, 1777), chasing British troops. They met at the [[Battle of Princeton]] on January 3, 1777, just over the township line, where the [[Princeton Battlefield State Park]] now stands.

Cornwallis stayed overnight in Maidenhead on December 8, 1776, en route to Trenton. Cornwallis recorded the moment in his diary, a portion of which was found years later in John Moore's Tavern, which is now a residential house at 2695 Main Street. His opinion of the village was that "one night in Maidenhead was more than enough".<ref>Tyler, Donald H., Old Lawrenceville, 1973, p. 40</ref>

When the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville was built in 1698, it was called the Meetinghouse of Maidenhead. It is still serving the community at 2688 Main Street.

==Education==
The Lawrenceville Elementary School, one of [[Lawrence Township Public Schools]]' four elementary schools, is located in Lawrenceville.

Lawrenceville is home to the [[Lawrenceville School]], a private boarding and day high school founded in 1810. It is one of the oldest prep schools in the United States.

Other schools in the township are [[Notre Dame High School (New Jersey)|Notre Dame High School]], St. Ann School, [[Princeton Junior School]], [[Chapin School (New Jersey)|Chapin School]], Lawrence Intermediate School (LIS), Lawrence Middle School (LMS), and Lawrence High School (LHS).

In May 2002, the residents including Asian/Chinese as well as non-Asian/Chinese population established a Chinese language school where students of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds could learn the Chinese language on Sunday afternoons. From September 2002 to June 2005, Lawrence Middle School was the host to YingHua Language School, which teaches Simplified Chinese to over 200 students. Since September 2005, YingHua has been residing in Rider University.

Since the 2001, [[HindiUSA]] has been offering classes in the Lawrence Middle School where all students can learn [[Hindi]] on Friday evenings. Starting 2012 the class was moved to [[Notre Dame High School (New Jersey)|Notre Dame High School]].

[[Strayer University]] has a campus in Lawrenceville.

[[Rider University]] has a campus located in Lawrenceville.

==Commerce==
Historically, the [[Lawrenceville School]] was the dominant economic force in the village. Since World War II, Lawrenceville has become a commuter town, serving educational and corporate employment centers in Lawrence Township, in Princeton and Trenton, in the surrounding cluster of corporate and research campuses, and to a lesser extent in New York City. There are no large businesses in Lawrenceville itself, but Lawrence Township is home to several large corporate facilities outside of the village, including the world headquarters of [[Educational Testing Service]], offices for the [[Lenox (company)|Lenox]] division of [[Department 56]], the main research facility for [[Bristol Myers Squibb]], and the offices of the [[Peterson's]] division of [[Nelnet]].

The village businesses share an organization, [http://www.lawrencevillemainstreet.com Lawrenceville Main Street], which organizes events, such as the Music in the Park series, the annual Jubilee, and Taste of Lawrenceville, and promotes the business district to visitors. The Lawrenceville Farmers Market is held every Sunday, from about June to November.

The Lawrenceville Fire Co., Lawrenceville Water Co. (now part of [[Aqua America]]), Lawrenceville Fuel, and a U.S. Post Office are also located in Lawrenceville.

Lawrenceville was formerly home to a family grocery, hardware store, pharmacy, and, most famously, the Jigger Shop, which served generations of Lawrenceville School students as a school store and soda fountain.<ref>[http://www.lawrenceville.org/campus_life/jigger_shop.asp Jigger hop], Lawrenceville School. Accessed December 1, 2011.</ref> A fire destroyed the shop on August 10, 1990. Caused by faulty electrical cords that ran to a store refrigerator, the fire burned through the store's ceiling into the second-floor apartment, which was unoccupied [http://www.lawrenceroadfire.org/html_history/1988_1990.html].  A new Jigger Shop then opened at The Lawrenceville School and was located on the first floor of the Noyes History Building, until its relocation to the Irwin Dining Center in 2011.
