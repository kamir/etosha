[[Image:Jon Stewart and Michael Mullen on The Daily Show.jpg|thumb|''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' is a news satire program]]

'''News satire''', also called '''fake news''', is a type of [[parody]] presented in a format typical of mainstream [[journalism]], and called a [[satire]] because of its content. News satire has been around almost as long as journalism itself, but it is particularly popular on the [[World Wide Web|web]], where it is relatively easy to mimic a credible news source and stories may achieve wide distribution from nearly any site. News satire relies heavily on [[irony]] and [[Deadpan|deadpan humor]].

==In history==
Richard A. Locke successfully increased sales of [[The Sun (New York)|''The Sun'']] newspaper in 1835 by publishing a series of six articles, now known as the [[Great Moon Hoax]], under the name of contemporary astronomer Sir [[John Herschel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historybuff.com/library/refmoon.html |title=The Great Moon Hoax of 1835 |publisher=Historybuff.com |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref>

Author [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) was employed as a newspaper reporter before becoming famous as a novelist and in this position he published many hoax articles.  He left two separate journalism positions, Nevada (1864) fleeing a challenge to duel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/samuel_clemens |title=Samuel Clemens |publisher=Onlinenevada.org |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> and San Francisco fleeing outraged police officials, because his satire and fiction were often taken for the truthful accounts they were presented as. Of this experience he said, "a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes." Ironically, the accuracy of many newspaper and autobiographical accounts used to follow the early life of Samuel Clemens are in doubt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsla.nv.gov/Myth_002 |format=PDF |title=Myth # 2 - Mark Twain Flees Nevada |first1=Guy |last1=Rocha |first2=Dennis |last2=Myers |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>

Newspapers still print occasional news satire features, in particular on [[April Fools' Day]].  This news is specifically identified somewhere in the paper or in the next day as a joke.

In 1934, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released a series of ten one-reel theatrical shorts called ''[[Goofy Movies]]'', which included "Wotaphony Newsreel," a [[newsreel]] parody that paired actual footage with a mocking, [[deadpan]] narration.

Also in 1934, halfway through a [[Kraft Music Hall]] radio show, Dean Taylor ("Others collect the news, Dean makes it!") narrated a fake newsreel which began with a report on the New York Giants and Philadelphia Phillies being cancelled due to bad weather, and baseball season being rescheduled to when farmers need rain.<!-- File missing (34 minutes into clip)

==On television==
{{globalize|date=November 2010}}
News satire has been prevalent on television since the 1960s, when it enjoyed a renaissance in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with the ''Satire Boom'', led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and [[Dudley Moore]] and the television program ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.

In the [[United States]], the [[NBC]] network adapted this program and also produced its own content, from the "news" segment of ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'', to the still-running ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' mock newscast segment "[[Weekend Update]]". [[Cable television]] got into the [[United States cable news|cable news]] act with [[Home Box Office]]'s ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]'' in the mid-1980s.

Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' and [[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' are currently very popular in the United States. The 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey found that ''Daily Show'' viewers were better informed than those who relied solely on conventional network news,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/Downloads/Political_Communication/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf |title=National Annenburg Election Survey |publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2014-08-16 |format=PDF}}</ref> and Steven Young of ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' compares the trust and influence Stewart enjoys today to that of CBS anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Steve|title=The 1974 Cronkite|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+1974+CRONKITE+JON+STEWART+IS+DRAWING+BIG+LAUGHS+BY+TELLING+THE...-a0122340122|accessdate=16 August 2014|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=2004-09-20}}</ref> However, a study published in the ''Journal of Communication'' suggests that entertainment news shows such as ''The Daily Show'' or ''The Colbert Report'' may not be as influential in teaching voters about political issues and candidates as was previously thought. Researchers from Ohio State University have found reasons to discount how effective these shows are in informing the general public. People watching television news learned more about a candidate's position on issues and about political procedures compared to those watching the fake news shows, while fake news shows primarily taught viewers about a candidate’s personal background.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/544129/ 'Fake' News Shows Less Important in Learning about Politics] Newswise, Retrieved on September 8, 2008.</ref>

[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] launched a news satire program in February 2007 with the title of ''[[The 1/2 Hour News Hour]]''. Its creator describes it as "The Daily Show for conservatives", but it was cancelled within a few months. Fox News has since launched the more successful ''[[Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld]]''.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], several news satires have been created, most famously the works of [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]. Show such as the radio series ''[[On the Hour]]'' and its television version ''[[The Day Today]]'' parodied news programs very accurately, so they were almost believable and could have been confused with actual news programs, if it was not for the fake stories reported. Morris went on to continue this and several other themes in ''[[Brass Eye]]'', one of the most controversial series on British television, especially after one episode broadcast mocked the way the news covered stories about [[pedophilia]].

Currently, British news satire is similar to shows such as ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report''. ''[[The Late Edition]]'' with [[Marcus Brigstocke]], on digital station [[BBC Four]], is heavily influenced by ''The Daily Show''. ''[[News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald]]'' parodied news differently, by using an actual newsreader as the host. Other news satires include ''[[Broken News]]'', which featured several sketches of different news channels blending into each other.

In Canada, ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' is an ensemble news satire show with four anchors on [[CBC Television|CBC]]. The ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'' is a spinoff of ''22 Minutes'' with former anchor [[Rick Mercer]], and is also shown on CBC. CBC Radio features ''[[This Is That]]'', a satirical public affairs program. The 1960s series ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]]'', although primarily a real newsmagazine, included some satirical features in its format, such as political humour songs by actress and singer [[Dinah Christie]]. [http://thelapine.ca The Lapine], a Canadian website satirizing local and national politics was founded in 2011 and has been gaining increasing press coverage from media outlets such as CTV.<ref>

In Germany, [[heute-show]] ([[ZDF]]), and formerly [[Wochenshow]] (on [[SAT.1]]) and [[Freitag Nacht News]] (on [[RTL Television|RTL]]) are popular news satires on TV.

The [[Egypt]]ian show ''[[El Bernameg]]'', hosted by [[Bassem Youssef (television host)|Bassem Youssef]] (on [[Capital Broadcast Center]] 2011-13 and [[MBC MASR]] from 2014 on), is modeled on ''The Daily Show''. Launched in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], it has been quite popular, but also a source of tremendous controversy, as Youssef has repeatedly been under investigation by the authorities for his willingness to poke fun at powerful people.

==Online==
News satire has been posted on the web almost since its inception, with ''[[The Onion]]'' foremost among recognized news satire site due to its enduring and profitable business model.<ref>{{cite web|author=Geoff Keighley Business 2.0 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/08/28/bus2.feat.onion.site/index.html |title=CNN.com - The Onion: Funny site is no joke - Aug. 29, 2003 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref>  The content of the website, which started in 1996, is syndicated through mainstream media sites such as [[CNN]] and [[CNET]]. Today there are hundreds of news satire sites online. Sites such as '''Hollywood Leek''' specialize in satirical articles about celebrities and Hollywood entertainment news.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leek|first=Hollywood|title=Disclaimer|url=http://hollywoodleek.com/disclaimer/|publisher=HollywoodLeek.com|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>  Sometimes fake news reporters influence real world politics, like [[Citizen Kate]] whose 90 episodes covered the 2008 presidential campaign trail, she commissioned a butter bust of Obama presented to him by the Butter Cow Lady of Iowa, making international headlines.<ref>{{cite news|last=Doty|first=Cate|title=Obama in Butter|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/obama-in-butter/|accessdate=18 April 2012|newspaper=NY Times|date=December 27, 2007}}</ref> [[El Koshary Today]] is an Egyptian website that carries fake international news stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/06/18/155134677/and-now-for-the-lighter-side-of-egypts-revolution |title=And Now For The Lighter Side Of Egypt's Revolution |publisher=NPR |date=

Because interesting stories are often emailed and can quickly become separated from their point of origin, it is not uncommon for news satire stories to be picked up as real by the [[News media|media]]; as had happened with a ''[[Faking News]]'' story about a lawsuit against Axe by an Indian man after having failed to attract a girl.<ref>{{cite web|author=r3vz says: |url=http://www.fakingnews.com/2009/10/unable-to-attract-even-a-single-girl-frustrated-man-sues-axe/ |title=Unable to attract even a single girl, frustrated man sues Axe |publisher=Faking News |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> Additionally, a parody post on Al Sharpton's parody News Groper blog was quoted as if real by MSNBC.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/08292007/business/msnbc_coms_fumble.htm |title=Msnbc.Com'S Fumble |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=2007-08-29 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> Another satire publication, ''The Giant Napkin'', published an article about a man literally fighting his house fire with more fire, a story taken seriously by several social networking sites. The fact that [[Google News]] accepts news satire sources helps contribute to this phenomenon; while Google News does mark such stories with a "satire" tag, not all readers notice the tag; moreover, sometimes satirical sources may not carry the tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/news/bin/answer.py?answer=40264&topic=8867 |title=Blogs, satire, and press release sites |publisher=Google News Help |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> At least one site, ''thespoof.com'', relies on user-generated content in a [[Web 2.0]] manner.

Some websites like ''Literally Unbelievable'' post the genuine and shocked reactions of individuals who believe the satirical articles are real. The reactions are taken from [[social media]] websites, such as [[Facebook]], in which users can directly comment on [[Hyperlink|links]] to the article's source.

Multi-author Indian website News That Matters Not, launched in November 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsthatmattersnot.com/p/about-ntmn.html |title=About |publisher=News That Matters Not |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> won a prestigious [[Manthan Award|Manthan South Asia Award]] for socially responsible e-content (Digital Inclusion for Development), organized by Digital Empowerment Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manthanaward.org/ |title=India's best e-Content Practices |publisher=The manthan Award |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> In [[India]], several community-based news satire websites have crept up in recent times. Their popularity on [[Facebook]] defines that they are popular amongst the masses. Very new websites such as The Scoop Times, Sunkey.co.in and [[The UnReal Times]] also claim to be run by students, and were covered in [[The Times of India]] in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid=16&edlabel=TOIBG&mydateHid=19-07-2011&articleid=Ar01603&publabel=TOI |title=Times of India Publications |publisher=Lite.epaper.timesofindia.com |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}{{subscription needed}}</ref>

Several sites community of selected news satire sites which runs its own satire news feed on [[HumorFeed]].  HumorFeed is notable for its relatively high standards of admission and active community involvement. At present, over 60 sites are contributing members, at least eight of which have published books and two of which publish regular hard copy periodicals.  Several HumorFeed members also run ''Check Please!'', an online journal devoted to the serious examination of online satire, ranging from its role in relation to actual journalism to practical considerations of producing an online satire site.

In July 2009, a satire piece about [[Kanye West]] published on the website ScrapeTV was picked up by numerous media outlets and reported as factual,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32241483/ns/entertainment-music/ |title=West debunks new 'King of Pop' rumors |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/kanye-west-not-king-of-pop-says-kanye-west/ |title=NY Times ArtsBeat |publisher=Artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kreps |first=Daniel |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-angrily-blogs-about-corny-king-of-pop-misquote-20090731 |title=Kanye West Angrily Blogs About "Corny" "King of Pop" Misquote |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2014-08-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203075324/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-angrily-blogs-about-corny-king-of-pop-misquote-20090731 |archivedate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=no}}</ref> despite disclaimers on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scrapetv.com/News/News%20Pages/Entertainment/pages-3/After-Jackson-death-Kanye-West-declares-himself-new-King-of-Pop-Scrape-TV-The-World-on-your-side.html |title=Kanye West declares himself King of Pop |publisher=Scrapetv.com |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref>

Satirical Twitter accounts of news sources are popular, and they are often mistaken as legitimate sources. Online publications have made quizzes challenging users to distinguish between the tweets of the real ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/quiz-real-vice-headline-or-vice-is-hip-parody.html/ |publisher=New York News & Politics |title=Quiz: Real Vice headline or Vice is Hip parody?  |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}</ref> and the tweets of their parodies.

In the Middle East, ''[[The Pan-Arabia Enquirer]]'' is the most widely read satirical news website. It gained notoriety in 2013 when an article about Emirates launching shisha lounges on its fleet of A380s was picked up as fact by news websites around the world.<ref>"The Pan-Arabia Enquirer: home of Middle Eastern political satire". The Guardian, 2013-08-12.</ref>

In Turkey, [[Zaytung]] has become a source of mass reading since the socio-political Gezi Park [[2013 protests in Turkey]].

In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago-based website, Wired868, has two wildly popular satirical columnists under the pseudonyms [http://wired868.com/author/mrlivewire/ Mr Live Wire] and [http://wired868.com/author/filbert-street/ Filbert Street], who comment satirically on relevant political and news stories such as the fall from power of ex-FIFA vice-president Jack Warner,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wired868.com/2013/05/03/controversial-ex-fifa-vp-concedes-his-last-political-post/ |title=Controversial ex-FIFA VP concedes his last political post |publisher=Wired868.com |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wired868.com/2013/04/02/yes-prime-minister-kamla-puts-foot-down-on-warner-issue/ |title=Yes Prime Minister: Kamla puts foot down on Warner issue |publisher=Wired868.com |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref> media issues,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wired868.com/2013/11/25/tabanca-tabloid-guardian-continues-quixotic-charge-against-ex-press/ |title=Tabanca tabloid: Guardian continues quixotic charge against Ex-press |publisher=Wired868.com |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref> general news<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wired868.com/2013/11/08/miracle-on-stone-street-alleyne-executes-amazing-blowjob-allegedly/ |title=Miracle on Stone Street: TV host Alleyne executes amazing BJ...

In Australia satirical news is limited to two mainstream publishers, The Shovel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theshovel.com.au/ |title=The Shovel - Australia's satire news website |publisher=The Shovel |accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref> and [[The Betoota Advocate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betootaadvocate.com/ |title=The Betoota Advocate |publisher=Rural Press Holdings |accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref>  The Shovel mainly satirizes the Australian political and social culture and The Betoota Advocate satirizes the political right and Australian journalism. In February 2015 the Betoota Advocate shot to fame after the publications editor's snuck in to the media scrum outside Parliament House in Canberra during a leadership spill motion and managed to interview some of Australia's most high profile media personalities and politicians, posing as legitimate journalists. The fallout from the Betoota Advocate stunt has lead to a security increase surrounding parliamentary media and screening of all crew.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jack |last=Phillips |url=http://www.betootaadvocate.com/entertainment/betootalive-breaking-news-from-parliament-house/ |title='#BetootaLive: Breaking news from Parliament House |publisher=Rural Press Holdings |date=2015-02-08 |accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref>

The output resembles an Onion cover devoted exclusively to the provided subject. This gave the satirical news movement a new momentum, allowing people to prank their loved ones, friends, bosses, etc. [http://www.YoursWeekly.com YoursWeekly.com] excludes itself from the search engines' indexing to prevent altering the online presence of the person in the articles. However, the articles are usually shared through [[social network]]s, where they make a big splash.
