'''New York''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the [[United States]]. New York is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|27th-most extensive]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|fourth-most populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|seventh-most densely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. New York is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]] with [[Rhode Island]] east of [[Long Island]], as well as an [[Canada–United States border|international border]] with the [[Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] to the north and [[Ontario]] to the west and north. The state of New York is often referred to as '''New York State''' or the '''State of New York''' to distinguish it from [[New York City]], the state's most populous city and its economic hub.

The earliest Europeans in New York were French colonists and Jesuit missionaries who came down from settlements at Montreal for trade and proselytizing. New York was inhabited by various tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] at the time [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers moved into the region in the early 17th century. In 1609, the region was first claimed by [[Henry Hudson]] for the Dutch. They built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where the present-day capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley]], establishing the colony of [[New Netherland]] based on trade and profitmaking. It was a multicultural community from the earliest days and the center of trade and immigration. The [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] annexed the colony from the Dutch in 1664. The borders of the British colony, the [[Province of New York]], were quite similar to those of the present-day state.

==History==
{{Main|History of New York}}

===17th century===
{{see also|Province of New York}}
Henry Hudson's 1609 voyage marked the beginning of European involvement with the area. Sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]] and looking for a passage to [[Asia]], he entered the [[Upper New York Bay]] on September 11 of that year.<ref>[http://blog.insidetheapple.net/2008/09/new-yorks-many-911-anniversaries-staten.html Nevius, Michelle and James, "New York's many 9/11 anniversaries: the Staten Island Peace Conference"], ''Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City'', September 8, 2008. Retrieved September 24, 2012.</ref> After his return to the Netherlands, word of his findings quickly spread and Dutch merchants began to explore the coast in search for profitable fur trade.

During the 17th century, Dutch [[trading post]]s established for the trade of pelts from the [[Lenape]], [[Iroquois]], and other [[indigenous peoples]] were founded in the colony of [[New Netherland]]. The first of these trading posts were [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] (1614, near present-day [[Albany, New York|Albany]]); [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (1624, on the [[Hudson River]] just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]]), developing into settlement [[Beverwijck]] (1647), and into what became Albany; [[Fort Amsterdam]] (1625, to develop into the town [[New Amsterdam]] which is present-day New York City); and Esopus, (1653, now [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]]). The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and governed it as the [[Province of New York]]. The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–1674) and renamed New Orange,returned to the English under the terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] a year later.<ref>Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.),''Exploring Historic Dutch New York''.

===American Revolution===
The [[Sons of Liberty]] were organized in New York City during the 1760s, largely in response to the oppressive [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in 1765. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in the city on October 19 of that year, composed of representatives from across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who set the stage for the [[Continental Congress]] to follow. The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]], which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], including the right to [[No taxation without representation|representative government]]. At the same time, with strong trading, business and personal ties to Britain among many New York residents, many were Loyalists.
[[File:NewYork1777MapRestoredSmall.png|thumb|New York in 1777]]

The [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] provided the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|cannon and gunpowder]] necessary to force a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] withdrawal from the [[Siege of Boston]] in 1775.

New York was the only colony to [[United States Declaration of Independence#Draft and adoption|not vote for independence]], as the delegates were not authorized to do so. New York then endorsed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 9, 1776.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/minisites/fourthofjuly/viewPage?pageId=690 |title=Declaration of Independence |publisher=history.com |accessdate=April 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409165028/http%3A//www.history.com/minisites/fourthofjuly/viewPage%3FpageId%3D690 |archivedate =April 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The New York State constitution was framed by a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which assembled at [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] on July 10, 1776, and after repeated adjournments and changes of location, terminated its labors at [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]] on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the [[Constitution of New York, 1777|new constitution]] drafted by [[John Jay]] was adopted with but one dissenting vote. It was not submitted to the people for ratification. On July 30, 1777, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] was inaugurated as the first [[Governor of New York]] at Kingston.

About one-third of the battles of the [[American Revolutionary War|U.S. Revolutionary War]] took place in New York. The first major battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] after independence was declared—and the largest battle of the entire war—was fought in New York at the [[Battle of Long Island]] (a.k.a. ''Battle of Brooklyn'') in August 1776. With the British victory, they occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[prison ship]]s of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants [[HMS Jersey (1736)|died of intentional neglect]] than were killed in combat in every battle of the war, combined. Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds.The first of two major British armies were captured by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, a success that influenced France to ally with the revolutionaries.The [[New York Constitution|state constitution]] was enacted in 1777. New York became the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.

In an attempt to retain their [[sovereign nation|sovereignty]] and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America, four of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Nations]] fought on the side of the British; only the Oneida and their dependents, the Tuscarora, allied themselves with the Americans.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution|author=Alan Taylor|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45471-7|year=2006}}</ref> In retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by [[Joseph Brant]] and Loyalist Mohawk and related forces, the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1778 and 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages, adjacent croplands and winter stores, forcing many refugees to British-held Niagara.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sullivan/Clinton Interactive Map Set |url=http://www.sullivanclinton.com/mapset/shell.swf |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

As allies of the British, the Iroquois were forced out of New York, although they had not been part of treaty negotiations. They resettled in Canada after the war and were given land grants by the Crown. In the treaty settlement, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States. Because New York made treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval, some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late 20th century by the federally recognized tribes. New York put up more than {{convert|5|e6acre|km2}} of former Iroquois territory for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War, leading to rapid development in upstate and western New York.<ref>Chen, David W.

[[File:1800LowsNYstate.jpeg|thumb|1800 map of New York from [[Low's Encyclopaedia]]]]
New York City was the national capital under the [[Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], the first government.  That organization was found to be insufficient, and prominent New Yorker [[Alexander Hamilton]] advocated a new government that would include an executive, national courts, and the power to tax.  Hamilton led the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] that called for the [[Philadelphia Convention]], which drafted the [[United States Constitution]], in which he also took part. The new government was to be a strong [[Federation|federal]] national government to replace the relatively weaker [[confederation]] of individual states. Following heated debate, which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation—[[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' Papers]]—as a series of installments in New York City newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/rat_ny.html|title=New York's Ratification |publisher=The U.S. Constitution Online |accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref>  New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790, and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington, the drafting of [[United States Bill of Rights]], and the first session of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Hamilton's revival of the heavily indebted United States economy after the war and the creation of a national bank significantly contributed to New York City becoming the [[financial center]] of the new nation.

Both the Dutch and the British imported African slaves as laborers to the city and colony; New York had the second-highest population of slaves after Charleston, SC. Slavery was extensive in New York City and some agricultural areas. The state passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery soon after the Revolutionary War, but the last slave in New York was not freed until 1827.

===19th century===
[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|thumb|[[Erie Canal]] at [[Lockport, New York]], in 1839]]
Transportation in western New York was difficult before canals were built in the early part of the 19th century. The [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] Rivers could be navigated only as far as Central New York. While the [[Saint Lawrence River]] could be navigated to [[Lake Ontario]], the way westward to the other [[Great Lakes]] was blocked by [[Niagara Falls]], and so the only route to western New York was over land.

Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] strongly advocated building a canal connecting the Hudson River with [[Lake Erie]], and thus all of the Great Lakes. Work commenced in 1817, and the [[Erie Canal]] was finished in 1825. Packet boats traveled up and down the canal with sightseers and visitors on board.<ref name=ErieCanal>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyscanals.gov/cculture/history/|title=The Erie Canal: A Brief History |publisher=New York State Canals |accessdate=April 10, 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> The canal was used even more extensively for commercial transport, as commodities were shipped from the Midwest, and finished goods transported along the canals in return from industries along the Mohawk Valley and New York City. It was considered an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement. It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to grow and prosper. It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes, with the port of New York City. Improving transportation, it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York. The construction of railroads through the state superseded the canal.

New York City and upstate textile mills did extensive business with the [[American South|South]] during the antebellum years. Nearly half of New York exports were related to cotton, and Southern planters and businessmen were so frequent in New York as to have favorite hotels. At the same time, activism for [[abolitionism]] was strong in the city and upstate, where many communities also supported the [[Underground Railroad]]. In the early days of the [[American Civil War]], the mayor of New York recommended that the city secede so its trade would not be damaged, but ultimately the city supported the war.<ref>New-York Historical Society</ref> During the Civil War, New York state provided more than 370,000 soldiers to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies. Over 53,000 New Yorkers died in service, roughly one of every seven who served.<ref>Phisterer, Frederick, ''New York in the War of the Rebellion, 1861 To 1865'', Albany: Weed, Parsons and Co., 1890, p. 88.</ref>

===Immigration===
{{Further|Ellis Island}}
[[File:Castle garden imigrant depot-NYC.jpg|thumb|[[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]] when it served as New York's first immigrant depot. Over 8 million immigrants passed through these doors.]]
[[File:Ellis Island in 1905.jpg|thumb|[[Ellis Island]] in 1905]]
[[File:Ellis Island immigration footage.ogg|thumb|right|Scenes at the Immigration Depot and a nearby dock on [[Ellis Island]]]]

Since the early 19th century, New York City has been the largest [[port of entry]] for immigration into the United States. Immigration has built the city and nation. In the United States, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government.  Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[East River]]s, in the eventual [[Lower Manhattan]]. On May 4, 1847 the [[New York State Legislature]] created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131110063703/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-10 |title=Castle Garden as An Immigrant Depot:1855–1890 |publisher=National Park Service|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

The first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]]; a converted [[War of 1812]] era fort located at the Battery at the tip of Manhattan. Today it stands within [[Battery Park]]. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from [[quarantine]]. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890 when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than 8 million immigrants passed through its doors (two out of every three U.S. immigrants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm |title=Castle Clinton |publisher=National Park Service|date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

When the federal government assumed control, it established the Bureau of Immigration, which chose the three-acre  Ellis Island in [[Upper New York Bay|Upper New York Harbor]] for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via [[land reclamation]], the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.<ref>Vincent J. Cannato: ''American Passage: The History of Ellis Island.'' p.50: Harper Collins (2009) ISBN 0060742739</ref>

Ellis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act]] was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were [[displaced persons]] or war [[refugees]]. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954 when the last person detained on the island, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15&nbsp;a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship.

More than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. In the 21st century, more than 100 million Americans across the United States can trace their ancestry to these immigrants.

Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was settled in 1998 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] which ruled that the original 3.3 acre island was New York State territory and that the balance of the {{convert|27.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling|author=Linda Greenhouse|date=May 27, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The island was added to the [[National Park Service]] system in May 1965 by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and is still owned by the Federal government as part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. Ellis Island was opened to the public as a museum of immigration in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm |title=Statue Of Liberty National Monument |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|September 11 attacks}} 
On September 11, 2001, two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The towers collapsed. [[7 World Trade Center]] also collapsed due to damage from fires. The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished. The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of 2,753 victims, including 147 aboard the two planes. Since September 11, most of Lower Manhattan has been restored. In the years since, many rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life-threatening illnesses, and some have already died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_yMv9jixDZNCnW9DXgTYhKJ|title=Charting post-9/11 deaths|first=Susan|last=Edelman|accessdate=January 22, 2012|date=January 6, 2008}}</ref>

[[National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center|A memorial at the site]] was opened to the public on September 11, 2011. A permanent museum later opened at the site on March 21, 2014.

===Hurricane Sandy, 2012===
{{main|Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York}}
On October 29 and 30, 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused extensive destruction of the state's shorelines, ravaging portions of New York City and Long Island with record-high [[storm surge]], with severe flooding and high winds causing [[power outage]]s for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and leading to [[gasoline]] shortages and disruption of [[mass transit]] systems. The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing [[seawall]]s and other [[coastal management|coastal barriers]] around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event. This is considered highly probably due to global warming and rise in sea levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/public/climatewire/2012/11/15/1|title=ADAPTATION: Political support for a sea wall in New York Harbor begins to form|author=Robert S.

New York covers {{convert|54555|sqmi|km2}} and ranks as the 27th largest state by size.<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html |title=Land and Water Area of States (2000) |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref> The [[Great Appalachian Valley]] dominates eastern New York and contains the [[Lake Champlain Valley]] as its northern half and the [[Hudson Valley]] as its southern half within the state. The rugged [[Adirondack Mountains]], with vast tracts of wilderness, lie west of the Lake Champlain Valley. The [[Hudson River]] begins near [[Lake Tear of the Clouds]] and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining Lakes [[Lake George (New York)|George]] or [[Lake Champlain|Champlain]]. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the [[Richelieu River]] and then ultimately the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. Four of New York City's [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] are situated on three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River: [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]]; [[Staten Island]]; and [[Long Island]], which contains [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] on its western end.

Most of the southern part of the state is on the [[Allegheny Plateau]], which rises from the southeast to the [[Catskill Mountains]]. The western section of the state is drained by the [[Allegheny River]] and rivers of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] systems. The Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the federal government, regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system. The highest elevation in New York is [[Mount Marcy]] in the Adirondacks.<ref name=usgs>{{cite web |date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090201060818/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |archivedate=2009-02-01 |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=U.S Geological Survey |accessdate=November 6, 2006}}</ref>

New York's borders touch (clockwise from the west) two [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]], which are connected by the [[Niagara River]]); the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]; [[Lake Champlain]]; three [[New England]] states ([[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Connecticut]]); the Atlantic Ocean, and two [[Mid-Atlantic states]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. In addition, [[Rhode Island]] shares a water border with New York. New York is the only state that touches both the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, and is the second-largest of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]].

In contrast with New York City's urban atmosphere, the vast majority of the state's geographic area is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. New York's [[Adirondack Park]] is the largest state park in the United States. It is larger than the Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic National Parks combined.<ref>[http://apa.ny.gov/About_Park/index.html About the Adirondack Park], Adirondack Park Agency. Retrieved July 1, 2009.</ref> New York established the first state park in the United States at Niagara Falls in 1885. [[Niagara Falls]], on the Niagara River as it flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, is a popular attraction.

[[Upstate New York|''Upstate'']] and [[Downstate New York|''downstate'']] are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State. The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of New York State| page = 1619| isbn = 978-0-8156-0808-0| year = 2005| publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]| editor = Eisenstadt, Peter}}</ref> Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the [[Southern Tier]], which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania,<ref>{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of New York State| page = 1437| isbn = 978-0-8156-0808-0| year = 2005| publisher=Syracuse University Press| editor = Eisenstadt, Peter}}</ref> and the [[North Country (New York)|North Country]], which can mean anything from the strip along the Canadian border to everything north of the Mohawk River.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Encyclopedia of New York State| isbn = 978-0-8156-0808-0| year = 2005| publisher=Syracuse University Press| editor = Eisenstadt, Peter}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of New York}}
[[File:LakeEffectSnowBuffalo101206.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Lake-effect snow]] is a major contributor to snowfall totals in western New York.]]
In general, New York has a [[humid continental climate]], though under the [[Köppen climate classification]], New York City has a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref name=NYClimate>{{cite web|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080412104922/http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archivedate=2008-04-12|title=Climate of New York|publisher=New York State Climate Office – Cornell University|accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref> Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold, dry one from the northwest.

The winters are long and cold in the Plateau Divisions of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of {{convert|-13|F|C|0}} or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and {{convert|5|F|C|0}} or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands (Southern Plateau). The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills and higher elevations of the Southern Plateau.

The New York City/Long Island area and lower portions of the [[Hudson Valley]] have rather warm summers by comparison, with some periods of high, uncomfortable humidity. The remainder of New York State enjoys pleasantly warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions. Summer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s °F (25 to 30&nbsp;°C), over much of the state.

New York ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]ses generated per person. This relative efficiency is primarily due to the dense, compact settlement in the New York City metropolitan area, and the state population's high rate of [[Public transport|mass transit]] use in this area and between major cities.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Breath of Fresh New York Air|author=The New York Post|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070606103459/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archivedate=2007-06-06|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>

New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves. [[Adirondack Park]], roughly the size of the state of [[Vermont]] and the largest state park in the United States,<ref name="lakeplacid.com">[http://www.lakeplacid.com/news/2013/10/largest-park-area-contiguous-us-remains-open-visitors ''Largest Park Area in the Contiguous US Remains Open to Visitors, Thursday, October 3, 2013.'']  Regional Office of Sustainable Tourism / Lake Placid CVB. Retrieved July 26, 2014.</ref> was established in 1892 and given state constitutional protection to remain "forever wild" in 1894. The park is larger than [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Everglades National Park|Everglades]], [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]], and [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] national parks combined.<ref name="lakeplacid.com"/> The thinking that led to the creation of the Park first appeared in [[George Perkins Marsh]]'s ''[[Man and Nature]]'', published in 1864.

The [[Catskill Park]] was protected in legislation passed in 1885,<ref name=CatskillPark1>{{cite web |url=http://www.catskillpark.org/history/history.htm|title=Catskill Park History |publisher=catskillpark.org |accessdate=April 11, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705134653/http://www.catskillpark.org/history/history.htm |archivedate =July 5, 2008|deadurl=yes }}</ref> which declared that its land was to be conserved and never put up for sale or lease. Consisting of {{convert|700000|acre|km2}} of land,<ref name=CatskillPark1/> the park is a habitat for bobcats, minks, and fishers. There are some 400 black bears living in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catskillmtn.org/guide-magazine/articles/2004-04-the-catskill-region.html|title=The Catskill Region |publisher=catskillmtn.org |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> The state operates numerous campgrounds, and there are over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of multi-use trails in the Park.

The [[Montauk Point State Park]] boasts the 1797 [[Montauk Point Light|Montauk Lighthouse]], commissioned under [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]], which is a major tourist attraction on the easternmost tip of [[Long Island]]. [[Hither Hills State Park|Hither Hills]] park offers camping and is a popular destination with surfcasting sport fishermen.

The State of New York is well represented in the National Park System with 22 [[national park]]s, which received 16,349,381 visitors in 2011. In addition, there are 4 [[National Heritage Area]]s, 27 [[National Natural Landmark]]s, 262 [[National Historic Landmark]]s and 5,379 listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
* [[African Burial Ground National Monument]]  in [[Lower Manhattan]] ([[New York City]]) is the only National Monument dedicated to Americans of African ancestry. It preserves a site containing the remains of more than 400 [[African people|Africans]] buried during the late 17th and 18th centuries in a portion of what was the largest colonial-era cemetery for people of African descent, both free and enslaved, with an estimated tens of thousands of remains interred.  The site's excavation and study were called "the most important historic urban archeological project in the United States."<ref name="ABG">[http://www.gsa.gov/africanburialground ''African Burial Ground''], General Services Administration, accessed February 10, 2012</ref>

* [[Fire Island National Seashore]] is a [[United States]] [[List of United States national lakeshores and seashores|National Seashore]] that protects a {{convert|26|mi|adj=on}} section of [[Fire Island]], an approximately {{convert|30|mi|adj=on}} long [[barrier island]]  separated from [[Long Island]] by the [[Great South Bay]]. The island is part of New York State's [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]].

* [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] is more than {{convert|26000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of water, marshes, and shoreline at the entrance to New York Harbor, the majority of which lies within New York. Including areas on Long Island and in New Jersey, it covers more area than that of two Manhattan Islands.

* [[General Grant National Memorial]] is the final resting place of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and is the largest mausoleum in North America.

* [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial]] preserves the home of [[Alexander Hamilton]], Caribbean immigrant and orphan who rose to be a United States founding father and indispensable partner to George Washington.

* [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site]], established in 1945, preserves the '''Springwood''' estate in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Springwood was the birthplace, lifelong home, and burial place of the 32nd [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

* [[Niagara Falls National Heritage Area]] was designated by Congress in 2008; it stretches from the western boundary of [[Wheatfield, New York]] to the mouth of the [[Niagara River]] on Lake [[Ontario]], including the communities of Niagara Falls, Youngstown, and Lewiston. It includes [[Niagara Falls State Park]] and [[Fort Niagara|Colonial Niagara Historic District]]. It is managed in collaboration with the state.

* [[Saratoga National Historical Park]] preserves the site of the [[Battles of Saratoga]], the first significant American military victory of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1777, American forces  defeated a major [[British Army]], which led [[France]] to recognize the independence of the United States, and enter the war as a decisive military ally of the struggling Americans.

* [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]] includes [[Ellis Island]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The statue, designed by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi|Frédéric Bartholdi]], was a gift from [[France]] to the United States to mark the Centennial of the American Declaration of Independence; it was dedicated in New York Harbor on October 28, 1886. It has since become an icon of the United States and the concepts of democracy and freedom.

* [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site]] is the birthplace and childhood home of President Theodore Roosevelt, the only US President born in New York City.

===Regions===
{{Main|List of regions of the United States#New York}}

[[File:Map of New York Economic Regions.svg|thumb|right|300px|Economic regions of New York]]

Due to its long history, the state of New York has several overlapping (and often conflicting) definitions of regions within the state.  This is further exacerbated by the colloquial use of such regional labels.  The New York State Department of Economic Development provides two distinct definitions of these regions.  It divides the state into ten economic regions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pad.human.cornell.edu/census2010/reports/2010%20race%20age%20sex%20New%20York.pdf |title=Age/sex/race in New York State: Based on Census 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents:

[[Downstate New York]] ([[Geography of New York City|New York City]], [[Long Island]], and the southern portion of the [[Hudson Valley]]) can be considered to form the central core of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], an urbanized region stretching from [[New Hampshire]] to [[Virginia]].

The major cities of the state developed along the key transportation and [[trade route]]s of the early 19th century, including the [[Erie Canal]] and railroads paralleling it. Today, the [[New York Thruway]] acts as a modern counterpart to commercial water routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thruway.ny.gov/about/factbook.html|title=New York State Thruway|work=thruway.ny.gov|publisher=New York State Thruway Authority|accessdate=September 15, 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

===Population===
[[File:New York Population Map.png|thumb|right|New York population distribution map]]
The distribution of change in population growth is uneven in New York State; the [[New York City metropolitan area]] is growing considerably, along with [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]]; while most of [[Western New York]] is nearly stagnant. According to [[immigration]] statistics, the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe. Between 2000 and 2005, immigration failed to surpass emigration, a trend that has been reversing since 2006. New York State lost two House seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment, secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the United States. In 2000 and 2005, more people moved from New York to [[Florida]] than from any one state to another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/State_Migration_Flows_Paper.doc|title=Domestic Migration Flows for States from the 2005 ACS|accessdate=October 19, 2007|format=Microsoft Word |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025032612/http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/State_Migration_Flows_Paper.doc |archivedate =October 25, 2007}}</ref> However, New York State has the second-largest international immigrant population in the country among the American states, at 4.2 million {{as of|2008|lc=y}}; most reside in and around New York City, due to its size, high profile, vibrant economy, and [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] culture.

New York exports a wide variety of goods such as foodstuffs, commodities, minerals, computers and electronics, cut diamonds, and automobile parts. In 2007, the state exported a total of $71.1 billion worth of goods, with the five largest foreign export markets being Canada (US$15 billion), United Kingdom (US$6 billion), Switzerland (US$5.9 billion), Israel (US$4.9 billion), and Hong Kong (US$3.4 billion). New York's largest imports are oil, gold, aluminum, natural gas, electricity, rough diamonds, and lumber.

Albany, [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]], and the Hudson Valley are major centers of [[nanotechnology]] and [[integrated circuit|integrated microchip circuit]] manufacturing, while the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] area is important in the field of [[photographic processing|photographic processing and imaging]]. The state also has a large [[manufacturing sector]] that includes printing and the production of garments, furs, railroad equipment and bus line vehicles; many of these industries are concentrated in Upstate regions.

New York is a major agricultural producer, ranking among the top five states for agricultural products such as dairy, apples, cherries, cabbage, potatoes, onions, and maple syrup. The state is the largest producer of cabbage in the U.S. The state has about a quarter of its land in farms and produced $3.4 billion in agricultural products in 2001. The south shore of Lake Ontario provides the right mix of [[soil]]s and [[microclimate]] for many apple, cherry, [[plum]], pear and [[peach]] [[orchard]]s. Apples are also grown in the Hudson Valley and near Lake Champlain.

New York is the nation's third-largest grape-producing state, and second-largest wine producer by volume, behind California. The south shore of Lake Erie and the southern [[Finger Lakes]] hillsides have many vineyards. In addition, the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of [[Long Island]] developed vineyards, production and visitors' facilities in the last three decades of the 20th century. In 2004, New York's wine and grape industry brought $6 billion into the state economy.

The state has {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of vineyards, 212 wineries, and produced 200 million bottles of wine in 2004. A moderately sized saltwater commercial fishery is located along the Atlantic side of Long Island. The principal catches by value are clams, lobsters, squid, and flounder.

New York has one of the most extensive and one of the oldest transportation infrastructures in the country. Engineering difficulties because of the terrain of the state and the unique issues of the city brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome perennially. Population expansion of the state has followed the path of the early waterways, first the [[Hudson River]] and [[Mohawk River]], then the [[Erie Canal]]. In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the [[New York State Thruway]] in the 20th century. The [[New York State Department of Transportation]] has been criticized for lack of road maintenance in some areas, and for collection of tolls past the payback for construction. Until 2006, tolls were collected on the Thruway within [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. They were dropped late in 2006 during the campaign for governor (both candidates called for their removal).

In addition to New York City's famous [[New York City Subway|mass transit subway]], four suburban commuter railroad systems enter and leave the city: the [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]], [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]], and five of [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit's rail lines]]. Many other cities have urban and regional public transportation. In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways.

The [[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NYSDMV or DMV) is the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other motor vehicles, as well as licensing drivers in the State of New York. {{As of|2008}}, the NYSDMV has 11,284,546 drivers licenses on file<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/statli08.htm |title=NYS DMV – Statistics – NYS Driver Licenses on File – 2008 |publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> and 10,697,644 vehicle registrations in force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/Statistics/regin08.htm |title=NYS DMV – Statistics – Vehicle Registrations in Force – 2008 |publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> All gasoline-powered vehicles registered in New York State are required to have an emissions inspection every 12 months, in order to ensure environmental controls are working to prevent air pollution. Diesel-powered vehicles with a Gross Weight Rating over 8 500&nbsp;lb that are registered in the NY Metropolitan Area must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in NYS must get an annual safety inspection.

Portions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to terminals at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].

In May 2009, the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] under the control of Transportation Commissioner [[Janette Sadik-Khan]] banned cars from [[Times Square]], in order to improve traffic flow and reduce air pollution, and to reduce pedestrian accidents in an area of high numbers of tourists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1187300/New-York-celebrates-new-era-cars-banished-Times-Square.html |accessdate=December 12, 2011 |publisher=MailOnline |title=New York celebrates new era as cars are banished from Times Square |location=London |date=May 26, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Andrew Cuomo 2014.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Andrew Cuomo]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|(D)]], current [[Governor of New York]].]]

The [[Government of New York]] is the governmental structure of the State of New York as established by the [[New York State Constitution]]. It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]] and [[judicial branch|judicial]].

The [[New York State Legislature]] is bicameral and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members; the Senate varies in its number of members, but currently has 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York|Consolidated Laws]]''.

The [[Governor of New York|Governor]] is the State's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]], the [[New York Attorney General|Attorney General]], and the [[New York State Comptroller|Comptroller]]. There are also several state government departments.

The highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]]s are the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and the county courts (outside of New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], [[traffic ticket]] cases and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases.

===Elections===
{{Main|Elections in New York|Political party strength in New York}}
In the last few decades, New York State has generally supported candidates belonging to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in national elections. Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] won New York State by 25 percentage points in 2008, a bigger margin than [[John Kerry]] in 2004. New York City is a major Democratic stronghold with liberal politics. Many of the state's other urban areas, such as Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse are also Democratic. Rural upstate New York, however, is generally more conservative than the cities and tends to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Heavily populated suburban areas downstate, such as Westchester County and Long Island, have swung between the major parties over the past 25 years, but more often than not support Democrats.

New York City is the most important source of [[political fundraising]] in the United States for both major parties. Four of the top five zip codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top zip code, 10021 on the [[Upper East Side]], generated the most money for the 2000 presidential campaigns of both [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2006 Election Overview: Top Zip codes|author=Opensecrets.org|date=May 16, 2005|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topzips.asp?cycle=2004|accessdate=July 19, 2006}}</ref>

The [[University of the State of New York]] oversees all public primary, middle-level, and secondary education in the state, while the [[New York City Department of Education]] manages the public school system in New York City. In 1894, reflecting general racial discrimination, the state passed a law that allowed communities to set up separate schools for children of African-American descent. But the Free African School had been set up in New York City in the early 19th century. In 1900, the state passed another law requiring integrated schools.<ref>Martha A. Sandweiss, ''Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line'', New York: Penguin Press, 2009, p. 213</ref>

At the post-secondary level, the statewide public university system is the [[State University of New York]] commonly referred to as SUNY. New York City also has its own [[City University of New York]], which is funded by the city. The SUNY system consists of 64 community colleges, technical colleges, undergraduate colleges, and doctoral-granting institutions including several universities. Many were founded in the 19th century as Normal Schools for the training of teachers, when public education was expanded. The four SUNY university centers, offering a wide array of academic programs, are the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], [[Binghamton University]], the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]], and [[Stony Brook University]].

Notable private universities include the [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[New York University]], and [[Fordham University]], the oldest Catholic institution in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. New York state is home to both [[Columbia University]] in New York City and [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].

[[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the service academy of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], is located just south of [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]].

During the 2007–2008 school year, New York spent more per pupil on public education than any other state.<ref>{{cite news |title=New York Leads Nation in Education Spending |last=Thomas |first=G.
