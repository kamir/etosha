==Early life==
L.L. Cool J was born James Todd Smith on January 14, 1968, in [[Bay Shore, New York]], to James and Ondrea Smith.

In March 1984, when [[NYU]] student [[Rick Rubin]] and [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]-[[Music manager|manager]] [[Russell Simmons]] founded the then-independent [[Def Jam]] label, 16&nbsp;year–old [[Hollis, Queens]] native James Todd Smith was creating [[demo tape]]s in his grandparents' home.<ref name="mtv"/> His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of equipment, including two [[Phonograph|turntables]], an [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixer]] and an [[amplifier]].<ref name=holden>Holden, Stephen. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DF1E31F935A15757C0A961948260 "From Rock To Rap"], ''New York Times'', April 26, 1987. Retrieved on 2008-11-16.</ref> Smith later discussed his childhood background and [[rapping]], stating that "By the time I got that equipment, I was already a rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking [[Spanish language|Spanish]] if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted was to make a record and hear it on the radio."<ref name=holden/> By using the [[mixing console|mixer]] he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various [[Record company|record companies]] throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videoeta.com/person/726|title=VideoETA....LL Cool J bio|publisher=VideoETA.com Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

Under his new [[stage name]], LL Cool J (an abbreviation for '''L'''adies '''L'''ove '''Cool''' '''J'''ames),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Ladies+Love+Cool+James+(rap+artist)|title=Acronyms and abbreviations by the Free Online Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref> Smith was signed by Def Jam, which led to the release of his first official record, the [[12-inch single]] "[[I Need a Beat]]" (1984).<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/ll_cool_j/artist.jhtml#bio|title=MTV.com - LL Cool J Bio|publisher=MTV Networks.|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes.<ref name="mtv"/> Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defjam.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=202|title=Def Jam Recordings - LL Cool J Biography|publisher=The Island Def Jam Music Group|accessdate=2008-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080429202053/http://www.defjam.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=202 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-04-29}}</ref> That same year, Smith made his professional debut [[Music concert|concert]] performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.&nbsp;... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is what I want to do'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/LL+Cool+J/2045/8892|title=LL Cool J bio: Edison Force ActorTribute.ca....|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of "I Need a Beat", along with the [[Beastie Boys]]'s single "[[Rock Hard]]" (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with [[Columbia Records]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.addressdefjam.com/|title=Address Island / Def Jam Records ...

==Career==

=== ''Radio'' (1985) ===
''[[Radio (LL Cool J album)|Radio]]'' was released to critical acclaim, both for production innovation and LL's powerful rap.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html|author=Hirschber Lynn|title=The Music Man |publisher=  [[New York Times Magazine]]|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref>

<!-- Commented out: [[File:LL on Bandstand.jpg|thumb|right|280px|LL Cool J was the first hip hop act to be presented on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', 1986]] -->

With the breakthrough success of his hit single "I Need a Beat" and the ''Radio'' LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Run-D.M.C.]]. [[Gig (musical performance)|Gigs]] at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986-'87 ''Raising Hell'' [[Concert tour|tour]], opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys.<ref name="askmen1">{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_100/100_ll_cool_j.html|title=Biography and other information at Askmen.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Another milestone of LL's popularity was his appearance on [[American Bandstand]] as the first hip hop act on the show.<ref name="mcgillismusic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgillismusic.com/ll_cool_j.htm|title=Career overview at McgillisMusic|publisher=World Wide Entertainment USA, Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412075151/http://www.mcgillismusic.com/ll_cool_j.htm |archivedate = April 12, 2008}}</ref>

The album's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. ''Radio'', along with ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'' (1986) and ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop.<ref name=CDuniverse.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1084925/a/Radio.htm |title=''Radio'' cd product notes |publisher=Muze Inc.  |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref><ref name="rhino1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html|title=Kurtis Blow Presents: The History Of Rap, Vol. 1: The Genesis|publisher=Rhino Entertainment|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads "REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN", referring to his [[Minimalism|minimalist production]] style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusicproducers/p/rickrubin.htm|title=About.com ...

=== Breakthrough and success (1987–1990) ===
LL Cool J's second album was 1987's ''[[Bigger and Deffer]]'', which was produced by [[DJ Pooh]].<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dj-pooh-mn0000663828/biography |title=DJ Pooh &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> This stands as his biggest-selling career album, having sold in excess of three million copies in the United States alone.  It spent 11 weeks at #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s R&B albums chart.  It also reached #3 on the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Pop albums chart. The album featured the singles "[[I'm Bad]]", the revolutionary "[[I Need Love]]" - L L's first #1 R&B and Top 40 hit, "[[Bigger and Deffer#Track listing|Bristol Hotel]]", and "[[Go Cut Creator Go]]".
LL Cool J's third album was 1989's ''[[Walking with a Panther]].'' Released in 1989, the album was a commercial success, with several charting singles ("Going Back to Cali," "I'm That Type of Guy," "Jingling Baby," "Big Ole Butt," and "One Shot at Love"). The album however was often criticized by the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] community as being too commercial and materialistic, and for focusing too much on love ballads.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r28044/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Walking with a Panther: Review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|author=Huey, Steve|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>  According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the album peaked at #6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was LL Cool J's second #1 [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|R&B]] Album where it spent four weeks.

[[File:Ll cool j-01-mika.jpg|thumb|left|200px|LL Cool J performing in Germany.]]
While the previous album ''[[Bigger and Deffer]]'', which was a big success, was produced by The L.A. Posse (at the time consisting of Dwayne Simon, Darryl Pierce and, according to himself the most important for crafting the sound of the LP, Bobby "Bobcat" Ervin), Dwayne Simon was the only one left willing to work on producing ''Walking with a Panther''. Bobcat said he wanted more money for the album after realizing how much of a success the previous album really had become but Def Jam refused to change the contract which made him leave Cool J.<ref name="The Rap Talk Crew">{{cite web|url=http://www.raptalk.net/news/features/RaptalksitsdownwithBobcatinahistoricinterview.php|title=A historic sit-down with Bobcat|publisher=Rap Talk Magazine|author=The Rap Talk Crew|accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> According to Bobcat this is the reason that ''Walking with a Panther'' was met with very mixed reception at the time of its release.<ref name="The Rap Talk Crew"/>

In 1990, LL released "[[Mama Said Knock You Out]]", his fourth studio album. The [[Marley Marl]] produced album received critical acclaim and eventually went double Platinum selling over two million copies according to the [[RIAA]]. LL won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 1992 for the title track.

===Continued success and career prominence (1993–2005)===
[[File:Ll cool j-04-mika.jpg|thumb|right|230px|LL Cool J in 2001.]]
After acting in ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'' and ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'', LL Cool J released ''[[14 Shots to the Dome]]''. The album had three singles ("How I'm Comin'", "Back Seat" and the strangely titled "Pink Cookies in a Plastic Bag Getting Crushed by Buildings") and guest-featured labelmates [[Lords of the Underground]] on "NFA-No Frontin' Allowed".  The album went gold.

LL Cool J starred in ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'', an [[NBC]] sitcom, before releasing ''[[Mr. Smith (album)|Mr. Smith]]'' (1995), which went on to sell over two million copies. Its singles included "[[Doin' It (LL Cool J song)|Doin' It]]" (that samples "My Jamaican Guy" by [[Grace Jones]]) and "[[Loungin]]" (that samples "Who Do You Love?" by [[Bernard Wright]]). Another of the album's singles, "[[Hey Lover]]", featured [[Boyz II Men]] sampling [[Michael Jackson]]'s "The Lady in My Life," which eventually became one of the first hip-hop music videos to air on  [[VH1]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The song also earned him a [[Grammy Award]]. Yet another single from the album, "I Shot Ya Remix", included vocal work by [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]].
In 1996, Def Jam released this "greatest hits" package, offering a good summary of Cool J's career, from the relentless minimalism of early hits such as "Rock the Bells" to the smooth-talking braggadocio that followed. Classic albums including ''Bigger and Deffer'' and ''Mama Said Knock You Out'' are well represented here.
In 1997, he released the album ''[[Phenomenon (LL Cool J album)|Phenomenon]]''. The singles included "[[Phenomenon (LL Cool J song)|Phenomenon]]" and "Father". The official second single from ''[[Phenomenon (LL Cool J album)|Phenomenon]]'' was "4, 3, 2, 1," which featured [[Method Man]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] & [[Master P]] and introduced [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and [[Canibus]].

In 2000, LL Cool J released the album ''[[G.O.A.T.]]'', which stood for the "greatest of all time." It debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=ll cool j|bio=true}} |title=Biography – LL Cool J |work=Billboard |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> and went platinum. LL Cool J thanked Canibus in the liner notes of the album, "for the inspiration".
LL Cool J's next album ''[[10 (LL Cool J album)|10]]'' from 2002, was his 9th studio (10th overall including his greatest hits compilation All World), and included the singles "[[Paradise (LL Cool J song)|Paradise]]" (featuring [[Amerie]]), "[[Luv U Better]]", produced by Pharrell and The Neptunes and the 2003 [[Jennifer Lopez]] duet, "[[All I Have (song)|All I Have]]". The album reached platinum status.
LL Cool J's 10th album ''[[The DEFinition]]'' was released on August 31, 2004. The album debuted at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' charts. Production came from [[Timbaland]], [[7 Aurelius]], [[R. Kelly]], and others. The lead single was the Timbaland-produced "Headsprung", which peaked at No. 16 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The second single was the [[7 Aurelius]]–produced, "Hush", which peaked at No. 26 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

=== Later career and touring (2006–2012) ===
LL Cool J's 11th album, ''[[Todd Smith (album)|Todd Smith]]'', was released on April 11, 2006. It includes collaborations with [[112 (band)|112]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Juelz Santana]], [[Teairra Mari]] and [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]]. The first single was the [[Jermaine Dupri]]-produced "Control Myself" featuring [[Jennifer Lopez]]. They shot the video for "[[Control Myself]]" on January 2, 2006 at Sony Studios, New York. The second video, directed by [[Hype Williams]], was "Freeze" featuring [[Lyfe Jennings]].

[[File:LL Cool J performing in Wilmington, Delaware.jpg|thumb|right|LL Cool J performing in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in August 2008.]]
In July 2006, LL Cool J announced details about his final album with Def Jam Recordings, the only label he has ever been signed to. The album is titled ''[[Exit 13]]''. The album was originally scheduled to be executively produced by fellow Queens rapper [[50 Cent]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535528/20060630/50_cent.jhtml?headlines=true |title=50 Cent, LL Cool J Teaming Up For LP – News Story Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> ''Exit 13'' was originally slated for a fall 2006 release, however, after a 2-year delay, it was released September 9, 2008 without 50 Cent as the executive producer. Tracks that the two worked on were leaked to the internet and some of the tracks produced with 50 made it to Exit 13.
LL Cool J partnered with [[DJ Kay Slay]] to release a [[mixtape]] called "[[The Return of the G.O.A.T.]]". It was the first mixtape of his 24-year career and includes freestyling by LL Cool J  in addition to other rappers giving their renditions of his songs. A track entitled "Hi Haterz" was leaked onto the internet on June 1, 2008. The song contains LL Cool J rapping over the instrumental to Maino's "[[Hi Hater]]". He toured with [[Janet Jackson]] on her Rock Witchu tour, only playing in Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, and Kansas City.
In September 2009, LL Cool J released a song about the ''NCIS'' TV series. It is a single and is available on [[iTunes]]. The new track is based on his experiences playing special agent Sam Hanna. "This song is the musical interpretation of what I felt after meeting with NCIS agents, experienced [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]]," LL Cool J said. "It represents the collective energy in the room. I was so inspired I wrote the song on set."<ref>{{Cite news | author=Adam Bryant | title=VIDEO: Check out LL Cool J's New NCIS:LA-Inspired Song | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/NCIS-Cool-J-1009723.aspx | work=TVGuide.com | date=September 16, 2010 | accessdate=September 16, 2010}}</ref>

Later that year, he had a starring role in ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'', in which he played Julian Washington, the talented but selfish running back on the dysfunctional Miami Sharks. Since then, LL Cool J has appeared in a variety of films, such as the [[Rollerball (2002 film)|2002 remake of ''Rollerball'']], ''[[Deliver Us from Eva]]'', ''[[Mindhunters]]'', and ''[[S.W.A.T.

==Legacy==
With the breakthrough success of his hit single "I Need a Beat" and the ''Radio'' LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Run-D.M.C.]]. [[Gig (musical performance)|Gigs]] at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986-'87 ''Raising Hell'' [[Concert tour|tour]], opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys.<ref name="askmen1"/> Another milestone of LL's popularity was his appearance on [[American Bandstand]] as the first hip hop act on the show.<ref name="mcgillismusic1"/>

The album's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. ''Radio'', along with ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'' (1986) and ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop.<ref name=CDuniverse.com/><ref name="rhino1"/> Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads "REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN", referring to his [[Minimalism|minimalist production]] style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions.<ref name="about"/> Rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.<ref name=about/>

''Radio''{{'}}s release coincided with the growing [[new school hip hop|new school]] scene and [[subculture]], which also marked the beginning of [[Golden age of hip hop|hip-hop's "golden age"]] and the replacement of [[old school hip hop]].<ref name=Warr.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.warr.org/llcoolj.html#Radio |title=Wilson & Alroy's Record Reviews - Radio |publisher=© 2007 - 2008 Gridwerk |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref><ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/345049/LL-Cool-J |title=Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia ... Def Jam, LL, & new school hip hop |publisher=©2008 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> This period of hip hop was marked by the end of the [[Hip hop music#Influence of disco|disco rap]] stylings of old school, which had flourished prior to the mid-80s, and the rise of a new style featuring "[[Ghettoblaster|ghetto blasters]]". ''Radio'' served as one of the earliest records, along with Run-D.M.C.'s [[Run-D.M.C. (album)|debut album]], to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and riffing sound of [[rock music]], pioneering the [[rap rock]] hybrid sound.<ref name=yahoo>[http://ca.music.yahoo.com/read/review/12039423 Yahoo! Music: Radio]. Yahoo! Inc. Retrieved on 2008-11-16.</ref>

The emerging new school scene was initially characterized by [[drum machine]]-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock, as well as boasts about rapping delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song, the artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the 1970s [[P-Funk]] and [[disco]]-influenced outfits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of acts prevalent in 1984, rendering them old school.<ref>Toop (2000), p. 126.</ref> In contrast to the lengthy, [[Jam (music)|jam]]-like form predominant throughout early hip hop ("[[King Tim III]]", "[[Rapper's Delight]]", "[[The Breaks (song)|The Breaks]]"), new school artists tended to compose shorter songs that would be more accessible and had potential for [[radio play]], and conceive more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts; the style typified by LL Cool J's ''Radio''.<ref>Shapiro (2005), p. 228.</ref> A leading example of the new school sound is the song "I Can't Live Without My Radio", a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as "quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self".<ref name=holden/> It was featured in the film ''[[Krush Groove]]'' (1985), which was based on the rise of Def Jam and new school acts such as Run-D.M.C. and the [[Fat Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casenet.com/people/llcoolj.htm|title=CaseNet.com - LL Cool J|publisher=CaseNet|accessdate=2008-06-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071121204648/http://www.casenet.com/people/llcoolj.htm |archivedate = November 21, 2007}}</ref>

The energy and [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] [[Flow (music)|delivery]] and musical style of rapping featured on ''Radio'', as well as other new school recordings by artists such as Run-D.M.C., [[Schooly D]], [[T La Rock]] and [[Steady B]], proved to be influential to hip hop acts of the "golden age" such as [[Boogie Down Productions]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].<ref name="Coleman354">Coleman (2007), p. 354.</ref> The decline of the old school form of hip hop also led to the closing of [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]], one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip-hop and that, coincidently, rejected LL's demo tape.<ref name=RapReviews>{{cite web |url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_radio.html |title=LL Cool J :: Radio ** RapReviews "Back to the Lab" series ** by Steve "Flash" Juon |publisher=RapReviews.com; Flash Web Design Exclusive |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> As the album served as an example of an expansion of hip hop music's artistic possibilities, its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi-racial audiences and listeners, adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well.<ref name=yahoo/>
