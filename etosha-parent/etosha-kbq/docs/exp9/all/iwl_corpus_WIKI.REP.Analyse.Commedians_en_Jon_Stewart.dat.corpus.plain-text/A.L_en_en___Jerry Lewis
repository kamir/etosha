'''Jerry Lewis''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AMh}} (born March 16, 1926) is an American comedian, actor, singer, film producer, screenwriter and film director. He is known for his [[slapstick]] humor in film, television, stage and radio. He was originally paired up with [[Dean Martin]] in 1946, forming the famed comedy team of [[Martin and Lewis]]. In addition to the duo's popular nightclub work, they starred in a successful series of comedy films for [[Paramount Pictures]]. For more than 40 years Lewis also hosted the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]]'s annual [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]] and was the national chairman of the MDA. Lewis has won several awards for lifetime achievements from The [[American Comedy Awards]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], and [[Venice Film Festival]], has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and in 2005 received the Governors Award of the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] Board of Governors, which is the highest [[Emmy Award]] presented.<ref name=govaward>{{cite news |last=Andorfer|first=Melanie|title=Jerry Lewis Honored By TV Academy|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/27/entertainment/main712316.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]], [[Associated Press|AP]]|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> On February 22, 2009, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Lewis the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]].

==Early life==
He was born '''Joseph Levitch''' (some sources say Jerome Levitch) in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] parents.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/714683/Jerry-Lewis|title=Jerry Lewis|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> His father, Daniel Levitch, was a [[master of ceremonies]] and [[vaudeville]] entertainer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/6/Jerry-Lewis.html|title=Jerry Lewis Film Reference bio|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jerrylewiscomedy.com/biography.htm|title=The Official Jerry Lewis Comedy Museum and Store|publisher=Jerrylewiscomedy.com|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jerry Lewis on Dean Martin: 'A Love Story'|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4973590|date=October 25, 2005|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|accessdate=2009-06-16}} (online excerpt from book, with link to ''[[Fresh Air]]'' radio show interview of Lewis by [[Terry Gross]])</ref> who used the professional name Danny Lewis.<ref>''In Person'', p. 11</ref> His mother, Rachel ("Rae") Levitch ({{née}} Brodsky),<ref>''In Person'', p. 12</ref> was a piano player for a radio station.

==Career==

===Teaming with Dean Martin===
{{Main|Martin and Lewis}}
[[File:Lewis and Martin.jpg|thumb|With Dean Martin in 1950]]Lewis initially gained fame with singer [[Dean Martin]], who served as [[straight man (stock character)|straight man]] to Lewis' zany antics in the [[Martin and Lewis]] comedy team. The pair distinguished themselves from the majority of comedy acts of the 1940s by relying on their interaction together instead of planned skits. In the late 1940s, they quickly rose to national prominence, first with their popular nightclub act, next as stars of their own [[The Martin and Lewis Show (radio program)|radio program]]. Within a year of their first act together, they went from earning $150–175 a week each at one club to $30,000.00 a week as a team at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Martin and Lewis made many appearances on early [[live television]], their first on the June 20, 1948, debut broadcast of ''[[Toast of the Town]]'' with [[Ed Sullivan]] on the CBS TV Network (later ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''). This was followed on October 3, 1948, by an appearance on the NBC TV series ''[[Welcome Aboard (NBC TV series)|Welcome Aboard]]'', then a stint as the first of a series of hosts of ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' in 1950. The duo began their Paramount film careers in 1949 as ensemble players in ''[[My Friend Irma (film)|My Friend Irma]]'', based on the popular [[My Friend Irma (radio-TV)|radio series of the same name]]. This was followed by a sequel in 1950, ''[[My Friend Irma Goes West]]''. Starting with ''[[At War with the Army]]'' (1950), Martin and Lewis were the stars of their own vehicles, in fourteen additional titles at Paramount, ending with ''[[Hollywood or Bust]]'' (1956). All sixteen were produced by Hal Wallis.
[[File:Dean Martin Jerry Lewis 1955 Colgate Comedy Hour.JPG|thumb|Martin and Lewis in 1955]]
As Martin's roles in their films became less important over time the partnership became strained. Martin's diminished participation became an embarrassment in 1954 when [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'' magazine]] used a publicity photo of the team for the magazine cover but cropped Martin out of the photo.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Mike|title='Dean & Me' really is a love story|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2005-10-25-dean-and-me_x.htm|accessdate=January 15, 2013|newspaper=usatoday.com|date=October 25, 2005}}</ref> The partnership ended on July 24, 1956. Attesting the team's popularity, [[DC Comics]] published the best-selling ''The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis'' comic books from 1952 to 1957, after which DC featured Lewis solo in ''[[The Adventures of Jerry Lewis]]'' until 1971. In this latter Lewis was sometimes featured with [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and various other DC heroes and villains. It inspired the [[Filmation]] cartoon production company to make a 1970 series called ''[[Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down]]'', with Jerry as the one reality-based character alongside other fictitious ones, including fictionalized Lewis relatives.

While both Martin and Lewis went on to successful solo careers, for years neither would comment on the split nor consider a reunion. They made occasional public appearances together between their breakup and 1961 but were not seen together until a surprise appearance by Martin on Lewis's Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Telethon in 1976, arranged by [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlksTohQJa4|title=1976 MDA Telethon - Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin Reunite}}</ref>

The pair eventually reconciled in the late 1980s after the death of Martin's son, [[Dean Paul Martin]], in 1987. In 1989, the two men were seen together on stage for the last time when Martin was making what would be his final live performances at Bally's Hotel and Casino in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Lewis pushed out a birthday cake for Martin's 72nd birthday and sang "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" to him, and joking, "why we broke up, I'll never know."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_10-23-2005/featured_0|title='We Had That X Factor' (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis)|last=Lewis|first=Jerry|last2=Kaplan|first2= James|authorlink2=James Kaplan|date=2005-10-23|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> In Lewis's 2005 book ''Dean and Me (A Love Story)'', Lewis wrote of his kinship with Martin, who died on December 25, 1995.

===Solo===

====1950s to 1970s====
After the split from Martin, Lewis remained at Paramount and became a major comedy star with his first film as a solo comic, ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'' (1957). Teaming with director [[Frank Tashlin]], whose background as a [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon director suited Lewis's brand of humor, he starred in five more films, and even appeared uncredited as Itchy McRabbitt in ''[[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|Li'l Abner]]'' (1959). Lewis tried his hand at releasing solo music in the 1950s, having a chart hit with the song "[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]" (a song largely associated with [[Al Jolson]] and later re-popularized by [[Judy Garland]]) as well as the song, "[[It All Depends on You]]" in 1958. He eventually released his own album titled, ''Jerry Lewis Just Sings''.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Lewis2>Lewis, Jerry. [http://jolsonville.com/2012/03/24/rock-a-bye-helps-jerry-lewis-become-a-singer/ Jolsonville], quotes by Lewis</ref> By the end of his contract with producer [[Hal B. Wallis]], Lewis had several productions of his own under his belt.

His first three efforts, ''[[The Delicate Delinquent]]'' (1957), ''[[Rock-A-Bye Baby (film)|Rock-A-Bye Baby]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Geisha Boy]]'' (1958), were all efforts to move away from Wallis, whom Lewis felt was hindering his comedy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 1959, a contract between Paramount Pictures and Jerry Lewis Productions was signed specifying a payment of $10 million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over a seven-year period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Krutnik|first=Frank |title=Inventing Jerry Lewis |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |year=2000 |page=105 |isbn=978-1560983699}}</ref>

In 1960, Lewis finished his contract with Wallis with ''[[Visit to a Small Planet]]'' (1960), and wrapped up work on his own production, ''[[Cinderfella]]''. ''Cinderfella'' was postponed for a Christmas 1960 release, and Paramount, needing a quickie feature film for its summer 1960 schedule, held Lewis to his contract to produce one. Lewis came up with ''[[The Bellboy]]''. Using the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]] in Miami as his setting—and on a small budget, with a very tight shooting schedule, and no script—Lewis shot the film by day and performed at the hotel in the evenings. [[Bill Richmond (writer)|Bill Richmond]] collaborated with him on the many sight gags. Lewis later revealed that Paramount was not happy financing a 'silent movie' and withdrew backing. Lewis used his own funds to cover the $950,000 budget. During production Lewis developed the technique of using video cameras and multiple closed circuit monitors, which allowed him to review his performance instantly. His techniques and methods, documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget. Later, he incorporated videotape, and as more portable and affordable equipment became available, this technique would become an industry standard known as [[video assist]].

Lewis followed ''The Bellboy'' by directing several more films that he co-wrote with Richmond, including ''[[The Ladies Man]]'' (1961), ''[[The Errand Boy]]'' (1961), ''[[The Patsy (1964 film)|The Patsy]]'' (1964) and the well-known comedy, ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963). Lewis occasionally handed directing reins to [[Frank Tashlin]], who directed several of his productions, including ''[[It's Only Money]]'' (1962) and ''[[Who's Minding the Store?]]'' (1963). In 1965, Lewis directed and (along with Bill Richmond) wrote the comedy film ''[[The Family Jewels (film)|The Family Jewels]]'' about a young heiress who must choose among six uncles, one of whom is up to no good and out to harm the girl's beloved bodyguard who practically raised her. Lewis played all six uncles and the bodyguard.

[[File:Jerry Lewis show.jpg|thumb|in ''The Jerry Lewis Show'' (1973)]]
On television, Lewis starred in three different programs called ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]''. The first was a two-hour Saturday night variety show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the fall of 1963. The lavish, big-budget production failed to find an audience and was canceled after 13 weeks. His next show was a one-hour variety show on [[NBC]] in 1967–69. A test of a syndicated talk show for Metromedia in 1984 was not continued beyond the scheduled five shows.

By 1966, Lewis, then 40, was no longer an angular juvenile and his routines seemed more labored. His box office appeal waned to the point where Paramount Pictures new executives felt no further need for the Lewis comedies and did not wish to renew his 1959 profit sharing contract. Undaunted, Lewis packed up and went to [[Columbia Pictures]], where he made several more comedies. Lewis taught a film directing class at the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles for a number of years; his students included [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]].<ref>Jerry Lewis: TV Guide Biography</ref> In 1968, he screened Spielberg's early film, ''[[Amblin']]'' and told his students, "That's what filmmaking is all about."<ref>{{cite book |author=Joseph McBride |title=Steven Spielberg – A Biography |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1997 |page=168 |isbn=978-1604738360}}</ref> Lewis starred in and directed the unreleased ''[[The Day the Clown Cried]]'' in 1972. The film was a drama set in a Nazi concentration camp. Lewis rarely discusses the experience, but once explained why the film has not been released, by suggesting litigation over post-production financial difficulties. However, he admitted during his book tour for ''Dean and Me'' that a major factor for the film's burial is that he is not proud of the effort.

====Stage work and recent decades====
Lewis has also appeared in stage musicals. In 1976, he appeared in a revival of ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin']]'' with [[Lynn Redgrave]], but it closed on the road before reaching [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Hellzapoppin%27_8211/|title=''Hellzapoppin'' 1976 revival, closed on the road before reaching Broadway|publisher=Broadwayworld.com|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> In 1994, he made his Broadway debut, as a replacement cast member playing the Devil in a revival of the baseball musical, ''[[Damn Yankees]]'', choreographed by future film director [[Rob Marshall]] (''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'').<ref>{{cite news |title=Theater Review: Damn Yankees; Finally, Jerry Lewis Is on Broadway |author=Vincent Canby |date=March 13, 1995 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Jerry Lewis - 1981.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis hosting his annual [[MDA Show of Strength|Telethon]] in 1981]]
Lewis returned to the screen in 1981 with ''[[Hardly Working]]'', a film he both directed and starred in. Despite being panned by the critics, the film eventually earned $50 million. He followed this up with a critically acclaimed performance in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1983 film, ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]'', in which Lewis plays a late-night TV host plagued by obsessive fans (played by [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Sandra Bernhard]]). Lewis continued doing work in small films in the 1990s, most notably his supporting roles in 1994's ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' and 1995's ''[[Funny Bones]]''. He appeared on television on one episode of ''[[Mad About You]]'''s first season in 1992, playing an eccentric billionaire. In 1994, the [[Columbia Pictures]] film, ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]'' featured footage of Lewis's classic movies. In 2008, Lewis reprised his role as Prof. Kelp in ''[[The Nutty Professor (2008 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', his first [[computer-generated imagery|CGI animated film]], a sequel to his 1963 film, co-starring [[Drake Bell]] as the voice of his nephew, Harold Kelp.

Lewis has long remained popular in Europe: he was consistently praised by some [[French people|French]] critics in the influential magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' for his absurd comedy, in part because he had gained respect as an ''[[auteur]]'' who had total control over all aspects of his films, comparable to [[Howard Hawks]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. In March 2006, the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Minister of Culture]] awarded Lewis the [[Légion d'honneur]], calling him the "French people's favorite clown".<ref>{{cite news |title=Jerry Lewis in Top French Honour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4814232.stm|agency=[[BBC News]]|date=March 16, 2006|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> Liking Lewis has long been a common stereotype about the French in the minds of many English-speakers, and is often the object of jokes in [[Anglosphere]] pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1349/do-the-french-really-love-jerry-lewis |title=Do the French really love Jerry Lewis? |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=The Straight Dope |author=Cecil Adams |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> "That Americans can't see Jerry Lewis's genius is bewildering," says N. T. Binh, a French film magazine critic. Such bewilderment was the basis of ''Why the French Love Jerry Lewis'' (2001), by Rae Beth Gordon.<ref name=Poirier />

In 2009, Lewis traveled to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] to announce his return to cinema, after a 13-year absence, for the film ''[[Max Rose]]'', his first leading role since Martin Scorsese's ''The King of Comedy''.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Jerry Lewis To Star In 'Max Rose'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003719.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=2009-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439558 |title=Max Rose (2010) |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> In early 2011, Lewis signed a deal with [[Artificial Intelligence Entertainment]] and [[Capital Films]] to remake three of his 1960s films (''The Bellboy'', ''Cinderfella'' and ''The Family Jewels''), with Lewis serving as co-executive producer of the new films. Then, a few weeks later on March 16, 2011, the Las Vegas Sun also wished him a Happy 85th Birthday.<ref>{{cite news |author=Robin Leach |date=March 16, 2011 |title=Strip Scribbles: Longtime Strip hotel to receive modern makeover |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2011/mar/16/strip-scribbles-longtime-strip-hotel-receive-moder/ |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> Lewis directed a musical theatre version of ''The Nutty Professor'' at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in [[Nashville]] from July 31 to August 19, 2012.

==Film portrayal==
Lewis was portrayed by [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] in the 2002 made-for-television movie ''[[Martin and Lewis (film)|Martin and Lewis]]''. The film focuses on Lewis' partnership with Dean Martin (played by [[Jeremy Northam]]) and how they came to be a team. Hayes met Lewis during shooting of the televised film, and went on to receive a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries.

He underwent a [[cardiac catheterization]] and two [[stent]]s were inserted into one of his coronary arteries, which had become 90% blocked. The surgery resulted in a return of blood flow to his heart and has allowed him to continue his rebound from earlier lung problems. Having the cardiac catheterization also meant canceling several major events from his schedule, but Lewis fully recuperated in a matter of weeks. In 1999, his Australian tour was cut short when he had to be hospitalized in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] with viral [[meningitis]]. He was ill for more than five months. It was reported in the Australian press that he had failed to pay his medical bills; however, Lewis maintained that the payment confusion was the fault of his health insurer. The resulting negative publicity caused him to sue his insurer for US$100 million.<ref>{{cite news |last=Price |first=Jenna |date=June 11, 2000 |title=Jerry Lewis Calls The Shots Now That He's Paid His Bill |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]}}</ref> Lewis has had [[prostate cancer]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Henkel|first=John|title=Prostate Cancer: New Tests Create Treatment Dilemmas|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v28/ai_15955600/|date=December 1994|work=[[FDA Consumer]]|publisher=[[BNET]]|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]],<ref name="seattlepi" /> [[pulmonary fibrosis]],<ref name="usat" /> and a decades-long history of [[heart disease]]. [[Prednisone]]<ref name="usat" /> treatment in the early 2000s for pulmonary fibrosis resulted in weight gain and a noticeable change in his appearance. In September 2001, Lewis was unable to perform at a planned London charity event at the London Palladium. He was the headline act, his band had taken to the stage, started up their music and he was introduced, but didn't appear as he had suddenly become unwell, apparently with heart problems, and was taken to hospital. Some months thereafter, Lewis began an arduous, months-long therapy that weaned him off [[prednisone]] and enabled him to return to work. On June 12, 2012, he was treated and released from a hospital after collapsing from [[hypoglycemia]] at a [[New York Friars' Club]] event. This latest health news forced him to cancel a show in [[Sydney]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-friars-club-jerry-lewis-collapsemt1thewrap43976-20120613,0,4472954.story|title=Jerry Lewis Rushed to Hospital After Friars Club Collapse (Report)|last=Kenneally|first=Tim|date=June 13, 2012|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Charity work===
Throughout his career, Lewis has supported fundraising for research into [[muscular dystrophy]]. From the early 1950s until 2011, he served as national chairman of the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] (MDA).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44013800/ns/us_news-giving/#.TjqwhTvj6rg|title=Jerry Lewis no longer MDA's national chairman|publisher=MSNBC|date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Lewis began hosting telethons to benefit MDA in 1952. From 1966 to 2010 he hosted the annual ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon'', since renamed the ''[[MDA Show of Strength]]''. It has raised over $2.6 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/06/24/3252231.htm|title=Jerry Lewis wows ACTU crowd|publisher=ABC News|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref> On August 3, 2011, it was announced that Lewis would no longer host telethons.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jerry Lewis Dropped From Labor Day Telethon |author=Brian Stelter	|date=August 4, 2011 |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/jerry-lewis-dropped-from-labor-day-telethon/ |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=May 3, 2015}}</ref> Lewis is no longer associated with the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/07/27/jerry-lewis-screwed-again-by-mda-theyre-using-his-old-clips-with-a-list-stars-to-promote-themselves |title=Jerry Lewis Screwed Again by MDA: They're Using His Old Clips With A List Stars to Promote Themselves |publisher=Showbiz411 |date=2014-07-27 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> On May 1, 2015, the MDA announced that in view of "the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving", the telethon was being discontinued.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/telethon-that-jerry-lewis-memorably-ran-pulls-plug/article_8534c8a7-e4e2-54bf-8439-028a970af8ae.html |title=Telethon that Jerry Lewis memorably ran pulls plug |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref>

===Jerry Lewis Cinemas===
In 1969, Jerry Lewis agreed to lend his name to "Jerry Lewis Cinemas", offered by National Cinema Corporation as a franchise business opportunity for those interested in theatrical movie exhibition. Jerry Lewis Cinemas stated that their theaters could be operated by a staff of as few as two with the aid of automation and support provided by the franchiser in booking films and in other aspects of film exhibition. A forerunner of the smaller rooms typical of later multi-screen complexes, a Jerry Lewis Cinema was billed in franchising ads as a "mini-theatre" with a seating capacity of between 200 and 350. In addition to Lewis's name, each Jerry Lewis Cinema bore a sign with a cartoon logo of Lewis in profile.<ref>{{cite news |last=Connelly|first=Sherilyn|title=Bad Ideas from the 1970s: Jerry Lewis Cinema Franchises Were a Nutty Disaster|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2011/08/jerry_lewis_cinemas_the_nutty.php|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>

Initially 158 territories were franchised, with a buy-in fee of $10,000 or $15,000 depending on the territory, for what was called an "individual exhibitor". For $50,000, the Jerry Lewis Cinemas offered an opportunity known as an "area directorship", in which investors controlled franchising opportunities in a territory as well as their own cinemas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8z8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&rview=1&pg=PA75-IA4#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=Life |title= Join Jerry Lewis (advt.) |page=75 |date=1971-12-31|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> The success of the chain was hampered by a policy of only booking second-run, family-friendly films. Eventually the policy was changed, and the Jerry Lewis Cinemas were allowed to show more competitive films, but after a decade the chain failed. Both Lewis and National Cinema Corp. declared bankruptcy in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|last=ccrouch|title=Fantasy & Failure With Jerry Lewis Cinemas|url=http://cinelog.org/cinelog/2009/03/28/fantasy-failure-with-jerry-lewis-cinemas/|publisher=Cinelog.org|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>
