'''''Short Attention Span Theater''''' (abbreviated '''''SAST''''') was an American [[clip show]] in which the hosts presented short segments of [[stand-up comedy]] acts and scenes from films airing on [[HBO]] and [[Cinemax]].

''SAST'' premiered on [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|the Comedy Channel]] in November 1989; it was one of the channel's initial programs. Because the Comedy Channel, HBO, and Cinemax were all owned by Home Box Office, Inc., the show was used to promote the parent corporation's programming.

In April 1991, the Comedy Channel merged with [[Ha! (TV channel)|Ha!]], [[Viacom]]'s competing comedy channel, to form CTV: The Comedy Network; two months later, CTV rebranded as [[Comedy Central]]. The network continued to order new episodes of ''SAST'' after this transition, but with some modifications.

''SAST'' had no [[Television presenter|presenter]] during its first few weeks. In 1990, the Comedy Channel reformatted the show and hired [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Patty Rosborough]] to present it—which they did until 1993. [[Mark S. Allen]] replaced them for the final two seasons. Among the show's various [[guest host]]s were Janet Decker, Joe Bolster, [[Marc Maron]], [[Laura Kightlinger]], [[Sue Murphy]], and brothers [[Brian Regan (comedian)|Brian Regan]] and [[Dennis Regan]]. In between clips, the hosts' banter often covered events in entertainment news.

''SAST'' was the first television venue for [[Marc Weiner]]'s "head puppet" [[comedy sketch]]es. The puppets' heads are the size of a human's, but the bodies are disproportionately small.

In 2002, several years after ''SAST'''s conclusion, Comedy Central broadcast a similar series called ''Comic Remix''. The show had a comparable format, and re-used many of the clips previously featured on ''SAST''.

In 2005, two shorts{{which|date=December 2013}} from ''SAST'' were animated for inclusion as bonus material for the [[DVD-Video]] release of the first season of ''[[Dr. Katz Professional Therapist]]''.
