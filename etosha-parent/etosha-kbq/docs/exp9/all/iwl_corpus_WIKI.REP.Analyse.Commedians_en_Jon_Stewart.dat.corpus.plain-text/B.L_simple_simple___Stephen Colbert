'''Stephen Tyrone Colbert '''(pronounced COL-bear) (born May 13, 1964) is an [[Americans|American]] [[actor]], [[comedian]], and writer. He is the [[Presenter|host]] of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091204/ap_on_en_tv/us_tv_canadian_colbert;_ylt=AnMEEUl3fc_1mMIFbkNktHwEtbAF;_ylu=X3oDMTJ0cWQ5OXBhBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMDkxMjA0L3VzX3R2X2NhbmFkaWFuX2NvbGJlcnQEcG9zAzEyBHNlYwN5bl9wYWdpbmF0ZV9zdW1tYXJ5X2xpc3QEc2xrA2NvbGJlcnRzbW9jaw--|title=Colbert's mock anti-Canada feud spirals on the Web|accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref> Colbert uses a special form of comedy called [[satire]] to make fun of politicians and the news media. 

On ''The Colbert Report'' (which he pronounces [[IPA]]:[{{IPA|ˌkɔl'beɹ ɹəpɹ}}] to make the words sound the same), he pretends to be a [[right-wing]] [[talk show]] host. He likes to ask his guests very embarrassing questions that make it seem that he is a serious far right-wing [[conservatism|conservative]] who is also not very smart.  His TV personality centers on the idea that if enough people believe something, it will be true.  This is largely based on conservative host [[Bill O'Reilly]]. In real life, Colbert is a [[liberal]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]].

Many [[celebrity|famous]] American [[politics|politicians]] and people in the news [[media]] agree to appear on his show because it is very popular. Colbert started as a [[comedy]] [[writer]] and performer for many other programs, such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and the ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'' movie, both also on Comedy Central. 

He has also voiced Phil Ken Sebben and Reducto in [[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]. Colbert has written three books.'' I Am America (And So Can You!)'' was No. 1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]]. He grew up in [[South Carolina]], the youngest of eleven children in a Catholic family,<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25questions.html</ref> and went to [[Northwestern University]]. He lives in [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]] with his wife and three children.<ref>http://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/celebrity-parents-stephen-colbert/</ref> He has made a word, 'truthiness'.<ref>http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002586.html</ref>
