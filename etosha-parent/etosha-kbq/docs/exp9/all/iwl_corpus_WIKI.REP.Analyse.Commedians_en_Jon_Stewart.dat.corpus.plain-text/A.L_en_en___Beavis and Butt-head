'''''Beavis and Butt-head''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated sitcom]] created and designed by [[Mike Judge]].<ref>{{cite news|title= That's Mr. Beavis and Butt-head to You |work= Los Angeles Times| date= 22 November 1994| first= Robert| last= Strauss |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-22/entertainment/ca-556_1_mike-judge| accessdate= 2010-11-08}}</ref> The series originated from ''[[Frog Baseball]]'', a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on [[Liquid Television]]. After seeing the short, [[MTV]] signed Judge to develop the concept.<ref>{{cite news|title= MTV Toon Dudes Are Slow on Two Counts Television |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]| date= 16 March 1993 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-16/entertainment/ca-664_1_animation-festival| accessdate= 2010-11-12| first= Daniel| last= Cerone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Butt-head, We Hardly Knew Ye|last= Rosenberg|first= Howard|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1997-11-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/entertainment/ca-57733|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> The series first ran from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997. In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]''.

It was revived in 2011 and new episodes began airing on MTV from October 27, 2011 to December 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/07/29/mtv-presents-full-slate-at-their-summer-tca-presentation-new-beavis-and-butt-head-good-vibes-to-premiere-october-27/99241/ |title=MTV Presents Full Slate At Their Summer TCA Presentation; New 'Beavis and Butt-Head' & 'Good Vibes' to Premiere October 27 |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> Later, reruns aired on other [[Viacom]] properties, including [[MTV2]], [[Comedy Central]] and [[UPN]].

==Premise==
{{Seealso|List of minor characters in Beavis and Butt-Head}}
The show centers on two socially incompetent, [[Heavy metal music|rock]]-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-head]] (both voiced by Judge), who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. They have no apparent adult supervision at home, and are dim-witted, under-educated and barely literate, and both lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Their most common shared activity is watching music videos, which they tend to judge by deeming them "cool," or by exclaiming, "This sucks!" (the latter is sometimes followed by the demand, "Change it!"). They also apply these judgments to other things that they encounter, and will usually deem something "cool" if it is associated with violence, sex, or the [[macabre]]. Despite having no experience with women, their other signature traits are a shared obsession with sex, and their tendency to chuckle and giggle whenever they hear words or phrases that can even remotely be interpreted as sexual or [[scatology|scatological]].

Each episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique music videos using commentary improvised by Judge. The remainder of the episode depicts the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.<ref>{{cite news|title= Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

In many episodes they skip school altogether. Their actions sometimes result in strict consequences, but often for others, for which they themselves show no remorse whatsoever.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Over its run, ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION; Keeping Beavis and Butt-Head Just Stupid Enough
|work= New York Times|date=October 17, 1993|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head&st=cse|accessdate=2009-08-11 | first=Elizabeth | last=Kolbert}}</ref> It became the focus of criticism from social conservatives, such as [[Michael Medved]], while others, such as [[David Letterman]], and the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]],'' defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the attention of many young television viewers in the United States and abroad and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and [[Generation X]]. [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], creators of ''[[South Park]],'' cite the show as an influence and compared it to the [[blues]]. They met Mike Judge before the show aired.<ref>"Taint of Greatness: The Journey of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 2," in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 2</ref>

In 1997, Dan Tobin of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' commented on the series' humor, stating that it transformed "stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh."<ref>"[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html Butting out]," ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''</ref> In 1997, Ted Drozdowski of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' described the 1997 ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' state as "reduced to self-parody of their self-parody."<ref>"[http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html Eye pleasers]," ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''.</ref> In December 2005, ''[[TV Guide]]'' even ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases.<ref>[http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}, TV Guide. Retrieved on 2008-04-02. In 2009, it was ranked No. 8 by ''TV Guide'' in their list of "TV's Top 25 Animated Shows."</ref> In 2012, ''TV Guide'' ranked ''Beavis and Butt-head'' as one of the top 60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time.<ref>http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx</ref>

Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – ''Blood Drive/Give Blood'' and ''Door to Door'' – which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand."<ref name="ReferenceA">"Taint of Greatness: The Story of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 1", in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 1</ref>

===Criticism and controversy===
Early installments gave them a juvenile obsession with fire and dangerous behavior, summed up with Beavis' chant of "Fire! Fire!" The show was blamed for the death of a two-year-old in [[Moraine, Ohio]] in October 1993. The girl's five-year-old brother set fire to his mother's mobile home with a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]], killing her.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DF143EF933A25753C1A965958260 |title=Cartoon On Mtv Blamed For Fire |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-10-10 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref> Because of this, MTV pulled the episode temporarily. The mother took the kid's bedroom door off its hinges so she could keep an eye on him. She later claimed that her son watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home.<ref name="nyt2" /> However, neighbors claimed that the family did not have cable television.<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 24, 1994|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

As a result, references to fire were removed from subsequent airings. The creators found a censorship [[loophole]] and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous "Fire! Fire!" (such as "Fryer! Fryer!" when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang "Liar, liar, pants on..." and pausing before "fire" (''Liar! Liar!'')). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion ("California" by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say "fire". However, MTV eventually removed the episode entirely. References to fire were cut from earlier episodes&nbsp;— even the original tapes were altered permanently.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sonic.net/~goblin/9beavis.html | title=Mike Judge interview | publisher= Goblin Magazine}}</ref> Other episodes MTV opted not to rerun included ''Stewart's House'' and ''Way Down Mexico Way''. Copies of early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare. The ones that exist are made from home video recordings of the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the ''Mike Judge Collection'' DVD set, Judge said he is uncertain whether some of the earlier episodes still exist in their uncensored form.

When new episodes returned in 2011, MTV allowed Beavis to use the word "fire" once again uncensored.<ref name="RS-2010-08-03">{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Greene |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20100803 |title=Exclusive: Mike Judge on the Return of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' |work= Rolling Stone |date= 3 August 2011 |accessdate=2010-10-25| archivedate=2010-11-07| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6329GV68w}}</ref> During the first video segment during "[[Werewolves of Highland]]", the first new episode of the revival, Beavis utters the word "fire" a total of 7 times within 28 seconds, with Butt-head saying it once as well.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= [[Werewolves of Highland]] |series= Beavis and Butt-head |network=MTV |date= October 27, 2011|season=8 |number=1}}</ref>

The show has also been blamed for animal cruelty and the murder of a cat with fireworks. In the summer of 1993, Dick Zimmerman, a 44-year-old retired broadcasting executive from [[Larkspur, California]], happened to see the episode in which Butt-head joked, "Hey, Beavis, let's go over to Stewart's house and light [a firecracker] in his cat's butt." Five days later, a cat was found killed by a firecracker in nearby Santa Cruz. Zimmerman, winner of a $10 million state lottery in 1988, immediately put up a $5,000 reward for the perpetrators, told the press that ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' was responsible for the death, and started a letter-writing campaign against the show. By the fall, 4,000 people from around the country had joined his campaign.<ref>John Leland, "Battle For Your Brain", ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 11, 1993, p. 51</ref>

In February 1994, watchdog group [[Morality in Media]] claimed that the death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] highway near the [[Holland Tunnel]] by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by ''Beavis and Butt-Head''.<ref name="nyt">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDF1538F933A25751C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Youth Is Held in Death from Bowling Ball]</ref> The group said that Settle was influenced by ''Ball Breakers'', in which Beavis and Butt-Head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop.<ref name="nyt" /> While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. Later it was revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant as well, that Settle did not have cable TV and did not watch the show.

In ''Lightning Strikes'', the show parodies blaming actions on youth culture. When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a thunderstorm, the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about [[Benjamin Franklin]], who Butt-head describes as "some old dude with long hair and glasses". The reporter asks if it was [[Howard Stern]], and when Butt-head answers "no", she asks if he has ever listened to Stern's radio program. The reporter continues asking them leading questions until they mention that they had watched rock music videos earlier in the day. The reporter then concludes on the air that the music videos are to blame for the duo's actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00&nbsp;p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:
:Beavis and Butt-Head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh.
This was later changed to:
:Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do could cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly [[deported]]. To put it another way: Don't try this at home.
This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game as well as their Windows game ''[[Beavis and Butt-head in Virtual Stupidity]]''.

They were famously lambasted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] as "Buffcoat and Beaver."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289100,00.html |title=Dude... This Sucks– We mourn the loss of fresh Beavis and Butt-Head episodes |publisher=EW.com Television News |date=August 15, 1997}}</ref> This subsequently became a running gag on the show where adults mispronounced their names, Tom Anderson originally calling them "Butthole" and "Joe", and believing the two to be of Asian ethnicity (describing them to the police as "[[Oriental]]"). In later episodes, Tom Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as "Penis and Butt-Munch." President Clinton called them "Beavis and Bum-head" in ''Citizen Butt-head'', as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America|movie]], where an old lady (voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]) consistently calls them "Travis" and "Bob-head". In ''Incognito'', when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named "Crevis and Bung-Head". Also, in ''Right On!'', when the duo appear on the Gus Baker Show, host Gus Baker, who is an obvious caricature of [[Rush Limbaugh]], introduces them as "Beavis and Buffcoat".

Beavis and Butt-head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savants]] because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge. With regard to criticisms of the two as "idiots", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.

==Film==
{{Main|Beavis and Butt-head Do America}}
In 1996, a full-length movie featuring the duo titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was released in theaters. The movie features the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Greg Kinnear]] (in an uncredited role), and [[David Letterman]] (credited as Earl Hofert). It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a "two thumbs up" from Siskel and Ebert. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $12 million to produce.

==Revival==
On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter that Mike Judge was creating a new ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' series, that Judge would reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation would be hand-drawn. According to [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], MTV had not asked [[Tracy Grandstaff]] to reprise her role as [[Daria Morgendorffer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/05/beavis-butthead-daria-morgendorffer-mtv-show-mike-judge/|title=Daria Left Out of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Reboot| publisher=TMZ| date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Later, in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Judge was asked if ''Daria'' was coming back and he said, "No. There's sort of a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in one episode. That'll be a surprise."<ref name="RS-2011-08-03">{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Greene |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20100803 |title=Exclusive: Mike Judge on the Return of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' |work= Rolling Stone |date= 3 August 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-25| archivedate=2011-11-07| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6329GV68w}}</ref>

As in the old series, Beavis and Butt-head are high school students who, among other things, criticize contemporary music videos.<ref name="revival">{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM |title=They're back! |work= New York Post |last=Starr |first=Michael |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-07-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100716203405/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM| archivedate= 16 July 2010| deadurl= no}}</ref> In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', MTV president Van Toffler said that the duo will also watch ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] matches, and amateur videos from [[YouTube]], as well as give movie reviews. "The biggest change is obviously the references are updated, it's set in modern day, and there's going to be a movie review segment," Linn said. "Otherwise they're still true to their prior passions."<ref name=rs>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/exclusive-new-beavis-and-butthead-will-tackle-jersey-shore-and-more-20110216| title= Exclusive: New 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Will Tackle 'Jersey Shore' and More| last= Greene| first= Andy| work= Rolling Stone| date=16 February 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628193918/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/exclusive-new-beavis-and-butthead-will-tackle-jersey-shore-and-more-20110216| archivedate= 28 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for ''[[King of the Hill]]'', told a ''Rolling Stone'' reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving ''Beavis and Butt-head''. On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of ''King of the Hill'' would work well for ''Beavis and Butt-head''; eventually he concluded, "Maybe we should just actually make some good ''Beavis and Butt-head'' episodes." Later, a [[Lady Gaga]] video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a ''Beavis and Butt-head'' revival: "I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point-of-view that only Beavis and Butt-Head could bring."<ref name=rs/>

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' opened the [[feature film]] with a [[3-D film|3-D]] ''Beavis and Butt-head'' short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2010, MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid-2011. On July 21, 2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at [[Comic-Con International]]. A preview of the episode "Holy Cornholio" was also shown.<ref>Sitterson, Aubrey.

UGO. 21 July 2010.</ref> Judge told ''Rolling Stone'' that at least 24 episodes (12 half-hour programs) will definitely air.<ref name="RS-2011-08-03" /> It was initially rumored that Judge was working on 30 new episodes for the network.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pingback: This Is The Story Of… |url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2010/07/07/is-mike-judge-working-on-30-new-episodes-of-beavis-and-butt-head/ |title=Is Mike Judge Working On 30 New Episodes Of 'Beavis And Butt-Head'? |publisher=Geeks of Doom |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref>

On January 10, 2014, Mike Judge announced that, while he is busy working on ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'', there is a chance of him pitching ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Judge: 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Trapped in Limbo|url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/articles/628453-mike-judge-says-beavis-and-butt-head-are-trapped-in-limbo|publisher=CraveOnline|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> While giving an interview to [[Howard Stern]] on May 6, 2014, Judge mentioned that MTV's demographics, rather than the show's ratings (which he said were second only to ''Jersey Shore''), were the reason the revived series hasn't been brought back on MTV. He also said that MTV was close to selling it to another network, "but it got wrapped up in deal stuff and eventually I stopped asking them about it," and that "it may still come back" on MTV or another network.

Also, in recent interviews, Judge claims that he is interested in producing a [[live-action]] movie, along with [[Johnny Depp]] expressing interest for the role of Beavis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slashfilm|url=http://www.slashfilms.com/mike-judge-talks-live-action-beavis-and-butt-head-film-johnny-depp-hoped-to-play-beavis}}</ref> He said that previously he despised the idea, but now he thinks "maybe there's something there."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/16/beavis_and_butthead_to_make_a_big_screen |title='Beavis And Butthead' To Make A Big Screen Return—Starpulse Entertainment News Blog |publisher=Starpulse.com |accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref> During an interview for Collider on August 25, 2008, Judge told them, "I like to keep the door open on ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of." However, he also added, "Another movie... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years—maybe—to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years." One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. "I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s," he said. "I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch." Judge added that he wouldn't completely ignore the time that has passed in between. "At one point I thought Butt-Head might do okay on some really low-level sales job".

===Marvel Comics===
From 1994 to 1996, [[Marvel Comics]] published a monthly ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' comic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotextra.com/bandbcollectiblescomics.html |title=Beavis and Butthead Central |publisher=Hotextra.com |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> under the [[Marvel Absurd]] imprint by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letters page was answered by Beavis and Butt-Head or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics. In their review of a [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] comic, Beavis tries to avoid using the word "fire" to describe the character's fiery skull.

In the comic, [[List of minor characters in Beavis and Butt-Head|minor characters]] like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

===Other appearances===
The characters have made cameo appearances (either visually or only voices) and have been referenced in numerous television shows, such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[The Head]]'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''[[TV Funhouse]]''), in films such as ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' and ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', and even parodied in cartoons such as ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Regular Show]]'', ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', and ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. They were featured in ''[[MAD Magazine]]'', as 'When Beavis and Butthead Grow Old'.

===''Daria'' spin-off===
{{Main|Daria}}
In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, ''[[Daria]]'', was created. Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' by [[Glenn Eichler]] and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. Eichler then became a producer for ''Daria''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brainy 'Beavis' Pal 'Daria' Spins Off |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 1997|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34294_1_daria-morgendorffer|accessdate=2010-11-20 | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg}}</ref> In the first episode of ''Daria'', she and her family move from Beavis and Butt-Head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale—the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode, with Daria saying Lawndale can't be a second Highland "unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too".

===Home video===
The first official [[home video]] releases of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' were two [[VHS]] tapes titled ''There Goes the Neighborhood'' and ''Work Sucks!'', distributed by [[Sony]] Music Video and MTV Home Video in 1996 in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Each tape contained approximately eight episodes, each selected from the first four seasons. Although most of the episodes were presented in complete form, minus the music video segments, a handful of episodes were edited for content. Eight more VHS compilations were released between 1996 and 1999 in the U.S., before the final volume, ''Butt-O-Ween'', was issued in October 1999. However, the series continued in Australia and U.K., with a further ten volumes being issued between 1999 and 2001. When the series ended in the U.K., a further seven volumes were issued exclusively in Australia, meaning that over 28 volumes, all 200 episodes were released on VHS.

Prior to the release of the VHS Volumes, a laserdisc titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head: The Essential Collection'' was issued in 1994, containing sixteen episodes from the second and third seasons. ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was also issued on Laserdisc in 1997.

All of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the [[Time–Life]] organisation. The DVD releases were titled ''The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head''. A two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set started selling on [[eBay]] at very high prices, sometimes over $300 USD, as well as fetching over $1000 USD in new condition on websites such as "Amazon.com". According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23060 |title=Mike Judge |publisher=The A.V. Club |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> In all, half of the 32 episodes on ''The History of Beavis and Butt-head'' weren't included on later releases of the series, including all but two episodes on the first disc.

On November 8, 2005, MTV and [[Paramount home entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released a three-disc DVD compilation titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-head: The Mike Judge Collection]]'', Volume 1. The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. The set was followed by Volume 2 and Volume 3. On January 27, 2008, MTV and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] made all three collections available on the [[iTunes Store]].

A Blu-ray and DVD release of Season 8, titled ''Beavis and Butt-head – Volume 4'', was released on February 15, 2011 in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Volume-4/16232 ''Beavis and Butt-head - Volume 4''] at TV Shows on DVD</ref>
