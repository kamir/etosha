==Career==
[[File:Ocean's Eleven1960.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' with [[Buddy Lester]], Joey Bishop, [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Dean Martin]]]]

Bishop began his career as part of a standup comedy act with his elder brother, Maury. He guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' at least 175 times from 1971–76, more than anyone else until that time ([[Jay Leno]] and [[Joan Rivers]] later surpassed his record).  He also frequently appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s and [[Jack Paar]]'s previous versions of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.

He starred in a [[situation comedy]] titled ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', which premiered on 20 September 1961 and ran for four seasons, first on [[NBC]] and later [[CBS]]. Bishop played a [[talk show]] host named Joey Barnes. His wife was portrayed by [[Abby Dalton]], who joined the cast in 1962.

He later hosted a 90-minute late-night talk show, also titled ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', that was launched by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1967 as competition to Carson's ''Tonight Show'' and ran for two years. His sidekick was then-newcomer [[Regis Philbin]].

Bishop was among the stars of the original ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'' film about military veterans who reunite in a plot to rob five Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve. He co-starred with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Peter Lawford of the so-called Rat Pack, although the five of them did not publicly acknowledge that name. During filming, the five entertainers performed together on stage in Vegas at the [[Sands Hotel]]. Bishop did only a little singing and dancing, but he told jokes and wrote most of the act's material. He later appeared with Sinatra, Martin and Davis in the military adventure ''[[Sergeants 3]]'', a loose remake of ''[[Gunga Din]]'', and with Martin in the western comedy ''[[Texas Across the River]]'', in which he portrayed an Indian.

Bishop was the only member of the Rat Pack to work with members of a younger group of actors dubbed the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]], appearing (as a ghost) in the 1990 film ''[[Betsy's Wedding]]'' with [[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Ally Sheedy]].

His final appearance in a film was a non-speaking role in ''[[Mad Dog Time]]'', written and directed by his son Larry. His character was named Gottlieb, which was Bishop's real surname.

Bishop was portrayed by [[Bobby Slayton]] in the 1998 [[HBO]] film ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]].''
