'''James Woodward "Jim" Downey''' (born 1952<ref name="nyt" /><ref>Downey was 55 years old as of early March 2008, according to a profile published at that time in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>) is an American [[comedy]] writer and occasional [[actor]].  Downey is best known as a long-time writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Early life==
Downey attended [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1974 with a degree in Russian.

==Writing==
While at Harvard, Downey wrote for the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', at a time when (as [[Steve O'Donnell (writer)|Steve O'Donnell]] said in 1987) "the proliferation of cable and the proliferation of comedy [led] the sensibilities of the Lampoon [to become] a little closer to the sensibilities of the [[mass media]]."<ref name="nytlamp">{{cite news

}}</ref> Downey, a member of that first generation of ''Lampoon'' writers to make a career in television, has been credited with playing a role in the shift. In 1976, ''100 Years of Harvard Lampoon Parodies'' was published in magazine format, edited by Downey and [[Eric Rayman]].  In 1976, Downey became a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He worked on 27 of the show's first 32 seasons, one of the longest tenures in the show's history.<ref name="nyt" />  He arrived at Saturday Night Live the same week as [[Bill Murray]] with whom he ended up sharing an office overlooking 50th Street, but he mostly began writing at ''SNL'' with [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], and [[Dan Aykroyd]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Miller |first= Dennis |interviewer= Dennis Miller |title= The Dennis Miller Show |last2= Downey |first2= Jim |url= http://www.dennismillerradio.com/blog?action=viewBlog&blogID=-854991830991973465 |date= 2011-12-23 }}</ref>  His first stretch as writer for the show ran from 1976 to 1980, culminating in a brief stint as a featured cast member. By the [[History of Saturday Night Live (1975-1980)#1979–1980 season|1979-1980 season]], [[Lorne Michaels]] had lost both [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]] to feature film careers, causing him to look to writers like Downey, Tom Schiller, Dan Aykroyd's brother [[Peter Aykroyd|Peter]], [[Al Franken]], Alan Zweibel, and [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]] to fill spots as cast members (along with SNL bandleader [[Paul Shaffer]] and newcomer [[Harry Shearer]]). When Michaels left the show in 1980, so did Downey, along with practically everyone else.

After leaving ''SNL'', Downey went on to become [[head writer]] of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' for a little over a year during its formative stages. He returned to ''SNL'' in 1984, serving for a while as head writer.  When [[Norm Macdonald]] began as ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor in the mid-1990s, Downey wrote exclusively for that segment of the show. Downey and Macdonald subsequently became a team, working away from the rest of the cast and crew. When Macdonald was fired from the show in 1998, Downey went with him.

Downey returned to the show in 2000. He continued to write for the show until 2013, pausing only in 2005 to work on a novel.<ref name="nyt" /> For an October 2000 skit satirizing a recent presidential debate, Downey came up with the word "[[strategery]]" for then-presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] (played by cast member [[Will Ferrell]]) to say, based on Bush's reputation for difficulty with public speaking. The word gained popularity, and soon afterward began to be used in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] fashion by members of Bush's own administration, as well as by political pundits on both sides, to refer to the Bush administration's political strategy.<ref>{{cite web

Former ''SNL'' ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor [[Dennis Miller]] has frequently called him the second most important person in the history of ''Saturday night Live'' behind only creator [[Lorne Michaels]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Miller |first= Dennis |interviewer= Dennis Miller |title= The Dennis Miller Show |last2= Downey |first2= Jim |url= http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/INTERNET-ONLY:-Jim-Downey/-249592285350416639.html |date= 2011-11-24 }}</ref>  In 2013, he retired from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after the end of [[Saturday Night Live (season 38)|38th season]] after working part-time, commuting from [[Upstate New York]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Miller |first= Dennis |interviewer= Dennis Miller |title= The Dennis Miller Show |last2= Downey |first2= Jim |url= http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/Up-To-a-Point/-869739034683769013.html |date= 2013-05-30 }}</ref>

==Acting==
Although he was only a credited actor on ''Saturday Night Live'' for one season, Downey has appeared in over 40 sketches from 1977 to 2005, his most notable being parody commercials such as Craig's Travellers Checks, First CityWide Change Bank, and Grayson Moorhead Securities. In 2007, he appeared in a [[SNL Digital Short|Digital Short]] titled ''Andy's Dad'', where he portrayed the father of cast member [[Andy Samberg]], and had a romantic relationship with guest star [[Jonah Hill]].

In movies, he is probably best remembered for playing the high school principal who judges the "academic decathlon" in ''[[Billy Madison]]''. His brief role in that film included a famous monologue in which he insults the title character, played by [[Adam Sandler]]. The monologue was based on a response Downey often gave to ''SNL'' cast member (and fellow ''Billy Madison'' cast member) [[Chris Farley]] in the ''SNL'' writers' room when Farley presented certain ideas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Downey interview by Norm Macdonald on ''The Dennis Miller Show'' |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEQkqSdeWGs#t=1813 |publisher=YouTube |date=July 16, 2008}}</ref>

He appeared in the [[Norm Macdonald]] movie ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'' as one of the homeless guys. Downey also had a bit part in [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s 2007 film ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', where he plays Al Rose, Little Boston's real estate broker. Anderson's YouTube channel is Al Rose Promotions, a nod to Downey's role. Downey is the second SNL writer to have had a role in a PT Anderson picture, the first being [[Robert Smigel]], who plays Barry Egan's brother-in-law in ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]''.

==Political views==
Given Downey's role in writing much of the political humor featured on ''Saturday Night Live'' during his tenure there, his own political leanings have been a source of speculation. Downey has said that he began his career as "a standard-issue Harvard graduate commie", but later turned into "a conservative Democrat".<ref name="snl political secrets">{{cite web |title='SNL' Political Secrets Revealed: Hillary's "Entitlement," the Sketch Obama Killed and the Show's "Karl Rove" |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snl-political-secrets-revealed-hillarys-726324 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |authors=James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales |date=August 29, 2014}}</ref> He is a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] member.<ref name="nytsnl20080313">{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Pro-Clinton?

TV critic [[Tom Shales]], author of the book ''Live from New York: The Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'',<ref>{{cite book|title=Live From New York|first=Tom|last=Shales|authorlink=Tom Shales|author2=James A. Miller|isbn=0-316-78146-0}}</ref> called Downey, and ''SNL'', an "equal opportunity slasher" in political comedy.<ref name="shales capitol gang">{{cite interview|last=Shales|first=Tom|subjectlink=Tom Shales|interviewer=[[Al Hunt]]|program=Capitol Gang, [[CNN]]|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/30/cnna.snl.politics/index.html|title=Tracing 'SNL's' political humor|date=2002-10-30|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

Some have called Downey more right-wing than his self-description, including Shales, who described him in 2002 as "a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]" and "pretty conservative".<ref name="shales capitol gang" /> In the ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'', former ''SNL'' head writer [[Adam McKay]] called Downey "right wing" and an "[[Ann Coulter]] pal".<ref name="vote hillary">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-mckay/live-from-new-yorkvote_b_90164.html|title=Live from New York...Vote Hillary!|first=Adam|last=McKay|authorlink=Adam McKay|date=2008-03-05|accessdate=2008-03-03|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref>

In an interview for the 2014 revised edition of Shales' ''Live From New York'', former ''SNL'' castmember [[Horatio Sanz]] criticized Downey as "basically the [[Karl Rove]] of ''SNL''", saying that his sketches about [[George W. Bush]] (whose administration roughly coincided with Sanz's tenure on the show) were often "out of tune with the audience."<ref name="snl political secrets" />

In early 2008, Downey wrote sketches for ''SNL'' mocking the then-ongoing [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential debates, 2008|Democratic Presidential Debates]], that depicted the [[news media]] as biased toward Obama. After the first sketch aired, candidate [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] referred to it at the beginning of the next debate. The sketches were controversial; McKay suggested that they were a ploy to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], since Clinton would be a weaker candidate than Obama.<ref name="vote hillary" /> In response, Downey "said he probably favored Mr. Obama over Mrs. Clinton, but that he genuinely felt she was receiving tougher treatment from the news media". He denied that ''SNL'' had intended to help Clinton.<ref name="nyt" /> The ''SNL'' sketches may have prompted tougher news coverage of Obama, according to work by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/wire/sns-ap-obama-media,0,2320627.story|title=A Harder Look at Obama, Post-'SNL'?|first=David|last=Bauder|work=[[Newsday]]|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2008-03-09
}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On Obama, he stated, "If I had to describe Obama as a comedy project, I would say, 'Degree of difficulty, 10 point 10.' It’s like being a rock climber looking up at a thousand-foot-high face of solid obsidian, polished and oiled. There’s not a single thing to grab onto — certainly not a flaw or hook that you can caricature.”<ref name="snl political secrets" />
