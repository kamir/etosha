The '''Statue of Liberty''' ('''''Liberty Enlightening the World'''''; French: ''La Liberté éclairant le monde'') is a [[:wikt:colossus#English|colossal]] [[neoclassical sculpture]] on [[Liberty Island]] in [[New York Harbor]] in [[New York City]], in the [[United States]]. The copper statue, designed by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], a French sculptor and dedicated on October 28, 1886, was a gift to the United States from the people of [[French Third Republic|France]].
The statue is of a robed female figure representing [[Libertas]], the [[Roman god]]dess, who bears a torch and a ''[[tabula ansata]]'' (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]], July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to [[History of immigration to the United States|immigrants]] arriving from abroad.

Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]], who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to American independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. He may have been minded to honor the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] and the end of slavery. Due to the troubled [[History of France#Second Empire.2C 1852-1871|political situation in France]], work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the Americans provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.

The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, and in [[Madison Square Park]] in [[Manhattan]] from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds. Publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] of the ''[[New York World]]'' started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000&nbsp;contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was constructed in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first [[ticker-tape parade]] and a dedication ceremony presided over by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]].

The statue was administered by the [[United States Lighthouse Board]] until 1901 and then by the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]; since 1933 it has been maintained by the [[National Park Service]]. The statue was closed for renovation for much of 1938. In the early 1980s, it was found to have deteriorated to such an extent that a major restoration was required. While the statue was closed from 1984 to 1986, the torch and a large part of the internal structure were replaced. After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, it was closed for reasons of safety and security; the pedestal reopened in 2004 and the statue in 2009, with limits on the number of visitors allowed to ascend to the crown. The statue, including the pedestal and base, was closed for a year until October 28, 2012, so that a secondary staircase and other safety features could be installed; Liberty Island remained open. However, one day after the reopening, Liberty Island closed due to the [[effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York]]; the statue and island opened again on July 4, 2013. Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916.

== Design and construction process ==

=== Origin ===
The origin of the Statue of Liberty project is sometimes traced to a comment made by French law professor and politician [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]] in mid-1865. In after-dinner conversation at his home near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], Laboulaye, an ardent supporter of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]], is supposed to have said: "If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort—a common work of both our nations."{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–9}}  The [[National Park Service]], in a 2000 report, however, deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet, and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870.<ref name="NPS African American"/> In another essay on their website, the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences, "With the abolition of slavery and the Union's victory in the Civil War in 1865, Laboulaye's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States. In order to honor these achievements, Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France. Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States, the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/stli/historyculture/abolition.htm|title=Abolition|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:U.S. Patent D11023.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frédéric Bartholdi|Bartholdi's]] [[design patent]]]]

According to sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], who later recounted the story, Laboulaye's comment was not intended as a proposal, but it inspired Bartholdi.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–9}} Given the repressive nature of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye. Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s, he approached [[Isma'il Pasha]], [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt#Modern history|Egypt]], with a plan to build a huge [[lighthouse]] in the form of an ancient Egyptian female ''fellah'' or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the [[Suez Canal]] in [[Port Said]]. Sketches and models were made of the proposed work, though it was never erected. There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal, the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]: an ancient [[bronze]] statue of the Greek god of the sun, [[Helios]]. This statue is believed to have been over {{convert|100|ft}} high, and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–8}}

Any large project was further delayed by the [[Franco-Prussian War]], in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was captured and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of [[Alsace]] was lost to the [[Prussia]]ns, and a [[French Third Republic|more liberal republic]] was installed in France.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–9}} As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=60–61}} In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with [[letter of introduction|letters of introduction]] signed by Laboulaye.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=39–40}}

Arriving at [[New York Harbor]], Bartholdi focused on [[Liberty Island|Bedloe's Island]] as a site for the statue, struck by the fact that vessels [[Port of New York and New Jersey|arriving in New York]] had to sail past it. He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government—it had been ceded by the [[New York State Legislature]] in 1800 for harbor defense. It was thus, as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye: "land common to all the states."{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=12–13}} As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers, Bartholdi visited President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=102–103}} Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail, and met many Americans he felt would be sympathetic to the project.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=39–40}} But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal, and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=16–17}}

[[File:2014-09-15 16-14-55 lion-belfort.jpg|thumb|Bartholdi's ''[[Lion of Belfort]]'']]

Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=85}} The son of a friend of Bartholdi's, American artist [[John LaFarge]], later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U.S. visit at La Farge's [[Rhode Island]] studio. Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=85}} He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians. One of these was the ''[[Lion of Belfort]]'', a [[monumental sculpture]] carved in sandstone below the fortress of [[Belfort]], which during the war had resisted a [[Siege of Belfort|Prussian siege]] for over three months. The defiant lion, {{convert|73|ft}} long and half that in height, displays an emotional quality characteristic of [[Romanticism]], which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=10–11}}

=== Design, style, and symbolism ===
[[File:Indian princess and Columbia.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from a fresco by [[Constantino Brumidi]] in the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., showing two early symbols of America: [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] (left) and the Indian princess]]

Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}} In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation.<ref name="dela" /> One of these symbols, the personified [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that [[Britannia]] was identified with the United Kingdom and [[Marianne]] came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian princess]], which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans.<ref name="dela" /> The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from [[Libertas]], the [[Religion in ancient Rome#Roman deities|goddess of freedom]] widely worshipped in [[ancient Rome]], especially among [[abolitionism|emancipated slaves]]. A Liberty figure adorned most [[Coins of the United States dollar|American coins]] of the time,{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}} and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including [[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]]'s ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'' (1863) atop the dome of the [[United States Capitol Building]].{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}}

Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke [[Classical republicanism|republican ideals]] commonly used representations of Libartas as an allegorical symbol.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}}  A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the [[Great Seal of France]].{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}}  However, Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famed ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830). In this painting, which commemorates France's [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]], a half-clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen.<ref name="dela" /> Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution, and so Bartholdi's figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes.<ref name="dela" /> Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work, Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch, representing progress, for the figure to hold.<ref name="Turner 2000" />

Crawford's statue was designed in the early 1850s. It was originally to be crowned with a ''[[pileus (hat)|pileus]]'', the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Jefferson Davis]], a Southerner who would later serve as [[President of the Confederate States of America|president]] of the [[Confederate States of America]], was concerned that the ''pileus'' would be taken as an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] symbol. He ordered that it be changed to a helmet.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=96–97}}
Delacroix's figure wears a ''pileus'',<ref name="dela" /> and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well. Instead, he used a [[diadem]], or crown, to top its head.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=105–108}} In so doing, he avoided a reference to Marianne, who invariably wears a ''pileus''.<ref name="Blume 2004-07-16" /> The seven rays form a halo or [[aureole]].<ref name="faq1" /> They evoke the sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents,<ref name="mint" /> and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world.<ref name="Turner 2000" />

Bartholdi's early models were all similar in concept: a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty, wearing a ''[[stola]]'' and ''pella'' (gown and cloak, common in depictions of Roman goddesses) and holding a torch aloft. According to popular accounts, the face was modeled after that of Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi, the sculptor's mother,{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=52–53, 55, 87}} but Regis Huber, the curator of the Bartholdi Museum is on record as saying that this, as well as other similar speculations, have no basis in fact.<ref name=TV>Interviewed for Watson, Corin. ''Statue of Liberty: Building a Colossus'' (TV documentary, 2001)</ref> He designed the figure with a strong, uncomplicated silhouette, which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering [[New York Bay]] to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan. He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling, reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose.<ref name="Turner 2000" /> Bartholdi wrote of his technique:

[[File:Freedom 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]]'s ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'']]

<blockquote>
The surfaces should be broad and simple, defined by a bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy the proportion of the work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.<ref name="Bartholdi 1885 p42" />
</blockquote>

Bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved. Bartholdi considered having Liberty hold a broken chain, but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the Civil War. The erected statue does rise over a broken chain, half-hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=105–108}} Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty's left hand; he settled on a ''[[tabula ansata]]'', a keystone-shaped tablet{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=108–111}} used to evoke the concept of law.<ref name="faq2" /> Though Bartholdi greatly admired the [[United States Constitution]], he chose to inscribe "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" on the tablet, thus associating the date of the country's [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] with the concept of liberty.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=108–111}}

Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor, architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], in the project.<ref name=TV /> As chief engineer,<ref name=TV /> Viollet-le-Duc designed a brick [[pier (architecture)|pier]] within the statue, to which the skin would be anchored.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=120}}
After consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget, Gauthier & Co., Viollet-le-Duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin, copper sheets, and the method used to shape it, [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]], in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers.<ref name=TV />{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=118, 125}} An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume, as the copper need be only {{convert|.094|in}} thick. Bartholdi had decided on a height of just over {{convert|151|ft}} for the statue, double that of Italy's [[Sancarlone]] and [[Hermannsdenkmal|the German statue]] of [[Arminius]], both made with the same method.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=26}}

=== Announcement and early work ===
By 1875, France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing interest in the upcoming [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=121}} In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, ''Liberty Enlightening the World''.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=123–125}} The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the [[pedestal]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=44–45}} The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during [[Franco-Prussian War|the war with Prussia]].{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=123–125}} [[Orléanist|French monarchists]] opposed the statue, if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a [[senator for life#France|senator for life]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=44–45}} Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the [[Paris Opera]] on April 25, 1876, that featured a new [[cantata]] by composer [[Charles Gounod]]. The piece was titled ''La Liberté éclairant le monde'', the French version of the statue's announced name.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=123–125}}

[[File:Collossal hand and torch. Bartholdi's statue of "Liberty.", from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|left|350px|[[Stereoscope|Stereoscopic image]] of right arm and torch of the Statue of Liberty, [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Centennial Exposition]]]]
Despite its initial focus on the elites, the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181&nbsp;French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the [[Franco-American alliance|French contingent]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the [[Panama Canal]]. The copper may have come from multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in [[Visnes, Rogaland|Visnes]], [[Norway]],<ref name="News of Norway" /> though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples.<ref name="NYTimes 2009-07-02 part 2" /> According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the [[Museum of the City of New York]], 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist [[Eugène Secrétan]] donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=36}} Historian Yasmin Khan, in her 2010 book about the statue, states that the firm of Japy Frères, copper merchants, donated copper valued at 64,000&nbsp;francs (about $16,000 at the time or the equivalent of US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16000|1876|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name="meas" />{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=137}}

Although plans for the statue had not been finalized, Bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm, bearing the torch, and the head. Work began at the Gaget, Gauthier & Co. workshop.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=126–128}} In May 1876, Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition,{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=25}} and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=26}} The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August; because of its late arrival, it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue, and while some reports correctly identified the work, others called it the "Colossal Arm" or "Bartholdi Electric Light". The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers' interest, including [[Bartholdi Fountain|an outsized fountain]] designed by Bartholdi.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=130}} Nevertheless, the arm proved popular in the exhibition's waning days, and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=49}} After the exhibition closed, the arm was transported to New York, where it remained on display in [[Madison Square Park]] for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=49}}

During his second trip to the United States, Bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project, and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco-American Union.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=134}} Committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=30}} The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and is often referred to as the "American Committee".{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=94}} One of its members was 19-year-old [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the future governor of New York and president of the United States.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=134}} On March 3, 1877, on his final full day in office, President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it. President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], who took office the following day, selected the Bedloe's Island site that Bartholdi had proposed.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=135}}

=== Construction in France ===
[[File:SOLparkParis.jpg|thumb||The statue's head on exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World's Fair]], 1878]]
On his return to Paris in 1877, Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head, which was exhibited at the 1878 [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World's Fair]]. Fundraising continued, with models of the statue put on sale. Tickets to view the construction activity at the Gaget, Gauthier & Co. workshop were also offered.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=137}} The French government authorized a lottery; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a [[terracotta]] model of the statue. By the end of 1879, about 250,000&nbsp;francs had been raised.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=32}}

The head and arm had been built with assistance from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=136–137}} The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder [[Gustave Eiffel]].{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=137}} Eiffel and his structural engineer, [[Maurice Koechlin]], decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron [[truss]] tower. Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton was attached to the center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars<ref name=TV /> which culminated in a mesh of metal straps, known as "saddles", that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=22}}{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=139–143}} To prevent [[galvanic corrosion]] between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with [[asbestos]] impregnated with [[shellac]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=30}}

Eiffel's design made the statue one of the earliest examples of [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] construction, in which the exterior of the structure is not [[load bearing]], but is instead supported by an interior framework. He included two interior [[Spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=33}} Access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided, but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder, {{convert|40|ft}} long.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=32}} As the pylon tower arose, Eiffel and Bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=34}} The components of the pylon tower were built in the [[Eiffel (company)|Eiffel]] factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/hauts-de-seine/la-tour-a-vu-le-jour-a-levallois-30-04-2004-2004947854.php |title=La tour a vu le jour à Levallois|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=April 30, 2004|work=Le Parisien |accessdate=December 8, 2012|language=fr}}</ref>

The change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change his plans for the statue's assembly. He had originally expected to assemble the skin on-site as the masonry pier was built; instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe's Island.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=144}}

In a symbolic act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, was driven by [[United States Ambassador to France]] [[Levi P.

=== The pedestal ===
[[File:Pedestal for Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Morris Hunt]]'s pedestal under construction in June 1885]]

The committees in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining funds for the construction of the pedestal. The [[Panic of 1873]] had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the [[Washington Monument]] sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=159–160}} There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and of the fact that the gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=159–160}} There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born [[Constantino Brumidi]] to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=163}} ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' declared its wish that "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once."{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=161}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances."{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=160}} Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=160}}

==== Design ====
[[File:Leslie Liberty.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'', June 1885, showing (clockwise from left) [[woodcut]]s of the completed statue in Paris, Bartholdi, and the statue's interior structure]]
The foundation of Bartholdi's statue was to be laid inside [[Fort Wood (New York)|Fort Wood]], a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it had served as a recruiting station.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=91}} The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="statistics" />
In 1881, the New York committee commissioned [[Richard Morris Hunt]] to design the pedestal. Within months, Hunt submitted a detailed plan, indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=169}} He proposed a pedestal {{convert|114|ft}} in height; faced with money problems, the committee reduced that to {{convert|89|ft}}.<ref name="stal" />

Hunt's pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture, including [[Doric order|Doric]] portals, as well as some elements influenced by [[Aztec architecture]].<ref name=TV /> The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail, in order to focus attention on the statue.<ref name="stal" /> In form, it is a truncated pyramid, {{convert|62|ft}} square at the base and {{convert|39.4|ft}} at the top. The four sides are identical in appearance. Above the door on each side, there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states (between 1876 and 1889, there were 40 U.S. states), although this was not done. Above that, a balcony was placed on each side, framed by pillars. Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal, above which the statue itself rises.<ref name="Bartholdi 1885 p62" /> According to author [[Louis Auchincloss]], the pedestal "craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty".<ref name="stal" /> The committee hired former army General [[Charles Pomeroy Stone]] to oversee the construction work.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=71–72}} Construction on the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} foundation began in 1883, and the pedestal's cornerstone was laid in 1884.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=169}} In Hunt's original conception, the pedestal was to have been made of solid [[granite]]. Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans; the final design called for poured concrete walls, up to {{convert|20|ft}} thick, faced with granite blocks.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=184–186}} This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in [[Branford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Branford’s History Is Set in Stone|url=http://connecticuthistory.org/branfords-history-is-set-in-stone/|publisher=Connecticut Humanities}}</ref> The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=184–186}}

[[Norwegians|Norwegian]] immigrant civil engineer [[Joachim Goschen Giæver]] designed the structural framework for the Statue of Liberty. His work involved design computations, detailed fabrication and construction drawings, and oversight of construction. In completing his engineering for the statue’s frame, Giæver worked from drawings and sketches produced by Gustave Eiffel.<ref name="structuremag.org">http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1484</ref><ref name="structuremag.org"/>

==== Fundraising ====
[[File:Head of the Statue of Liberty 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Unpacking of the head of the Statue of Liberty, which was delivered on June 17, 1885]]

Fundraising for the statue had begun in 1882. The committee organized a large number of money-raising events.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=163–164}} As part of one such effort, an auction of art and manuscripts, poet [[Emma Lazarus]] was asked to donate an original work. She initially declined, stating she could not write a poem about a statue. At the time, she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[pogrom]]s in eastern Europe. These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced. She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=165–166}} The resulting [[sonnet]], "[[The New Colossus]]", including the iconic lines "Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free", is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in its base.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=172–175}}

Even with these efforts, fundraising lagged. [[Grover Cleveland]], the [[governor of New York]], vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it.<ref name="Levine Story 1961" />

[[Joseph Pulitzer]], publisher of the ''[[New York World]]'', a New York newspaper, announced a drive to raise $100,000 – the equivalent of $2.3&nbsp;million today.<ref name="meas" /> Pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor, no matter how small the amount given.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|pp=40–41}} The drive captured the imagination of New Yorkers, especially when Pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors. "A young girl alone in the world" donated "60&nbsp;cents, the result of self denial."{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=105}} One donor gave "five cents as a poor office boy's [[Lesson of the widow's mite|mite]] toward the Pedestal Fund." A group of children sent a dollar as "the money we saved to go to the circus with."{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=51}} Another dollar was given by a "lonely and very aged woman."{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=105}} Residents of a home for alcoholics in New York's rival city of [[Brooklyn]] – the cities would not merge until 1898 – donated $15; other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=107}} A kindergarten class in [[Davenport, Iowa]], mailed the ''World'' a gift of $1.35.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=105}} As the donations flooded in, the committee resumed work on the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=110–111}}

==== Construction ====
On June 17, 1885, the French steamer ''Isère'', laden with the Statue of Liberty, reached the New York port safely. New Yorkers displayed their new-found enthusiasm for the statue, as the French vessel arrived with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board. Two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the ''Isère''.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=112}} <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%206/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Telegram/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Telegram%201885%20Jun%20-%201885%20Oct%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Telegram%201885%20Jun%20-%201885%20Oct%20Grayscale%20-%200140.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&u=ffffffffc423758c&DocId=5727280&Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20I%2dE&HitCount=4&hits=4f+179+197+198+&SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&.pdf |title= The Isere-Bartholdi Gift Reaches the Horsehoe Safely |work= The Evening Post |date=June 17, 1885 |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> After five months of daily calls to donate to the statue fund, on August 11, 1885, the ''World'' announced that $102,000 had been raised from 120,000&nbsp;donors, and that 80 percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=114}}

Even with the success of the fund drive, the pedestal was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel [[I-beam]]s within the concrete pedestal and assembled.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=19}} Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=49}} Due to the width of the pedestal, it was not possible to erect [[scaffolding]], and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=64}} Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch – which was covered with [[gold leaf]] – and placed the lights inside them.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=36}} A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=133–134}} After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], co-designer of New York's [[Central Park]] and Brooklyn's [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=65}}

=== Dedication ===
[[File:EdwardMoran-UnveilingTheStatueofLiberty1886Large.jpg|thumb|''Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World'' (1886) by [[Edward Moran]]. Oil on canvas. The J. Clarence Davies Collection, [[Museum of the City of New York]].]]
A ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=176}} On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at [[Madison Square]], once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to [[Battery Park]] at the southern tip of [[Manhattan]] by way of [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the ''World'' building on [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]]. As the parade passed the [[New York Stock Exchange]], traders threw [[ticker tape]] from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the [[ticker-tape parade]].{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=177–178}}

A nautical parade began at 12:45&nbsp;p.m., and President Cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to Bedloe's Island for the dedication.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=52}} De Lesseps made the first speech, on behalf of the French committee, followed by the chairman of the New York committee, Senator [[William M. Evarts]]. A [[Flag of France|French flag]] draped across the statue's face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of Evarts's speech, but Bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely. The ensuing cheers put an end to Evarts's address.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=177–178}} President Cleveland spoke next, stating that the statue's "stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man's oppression until Liberty enlightens the world".{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=127}} Bartholdi, observed near the dais, was called upon to speak, but he refused. Orator [[Chauncey M. Depew]] concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=71}}

No members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area [[suffragist]]s, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=127}} A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=128}}

Shortly after the dedication, ''[[The Cleveland Gazette]]'', an [[African American]] newspaper, suggested that the statue's torch not be lit until the United States became a free nation "in reality":

<blockquote>
"Liberty enlightening the world," indeed! The expression makes us sick. This government is a howling farce. It can not or rather ''does not'' protect its citizens within its ''own'' borders. Shove the Bartholdi statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the "liberty" of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family, without being ku-kluxed, perhaps murdered, his daughter and wife outraged, and his property destroyed. The idea of the "liberty" of this country "enlightening the world," or even Patagonia, is ridiculous in the extreme.<ref name="Cleveland Gazette 1886-11-27" />
</blockquote>

When the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue's dedication, it produced only a faint gleam, barely visible from Manhattan. The ''World'' characterized it as "more like a glowworm than a beacon."{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=133–134}} Bartholdi suggested [[gilding]] the statue to increase its ability to reflect light, but this proved too expensive. The [[United States Lighthouse Board]] took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch's effect; in spite of its efforts, the statue remained virtually invisible at night. When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893, he made additional suggestions, all of which proved ineffective. He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue, allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel's design.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=133–134}} In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt, once a member of the New York committee, ordered the statue's transfer to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], as it had proved useless as a lighthouse.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} A unit of the [[Army Signal Corps]] was stationed on Bedloe's Island until 1923, after which [[Military Police Corps (United States Army)|military police]] remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=24}}

The statue rapidly became a landmark. Many immigrants who entered through New York saw it as a welcoming sight. Oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the Statue of Liberty. One immigrant who arrived from Greece recalled,
<blockquote>I saw the Statue of Liberty. And I said to myself, "Lady, you're such a beautiful!{{sic}} You opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here. Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it, to do something, to be someone in America." And always that statue was on my mind.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=78}}</blockquote>

Originally, the statue was a dull copper color, but shortly after 1900 a green [[patina]], also called [[verdigris]], caused by the oxidation of the copper skin, began to spread. As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press; by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue.<ref name="NYTimes 2009-07-02 part 1" /> Accepting a view that the patina was evidence of corrosion, Congress authorized $62,800 for various repairs, and to paint the statue both inside and out.<ref name="NYTimes 1906-07-19" /> There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting.<ref name="NYTimes 1906-07-29" /> The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin, "softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful."{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=168}} The statue was painted only on the inside. The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=168}}

On July 30, 1916, during World War I, German saboteurs set off [[Black Tom explosion|a disastrous explosion]] on the Black Tom peninsula in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], in what is now part of [[Liberty State Park]], close to Bedloe's Island. Carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to Britain and France for their war efforts were detonated, and seven people were killed. The statue sustained minor damage, mostly to the torch-bearing right arm, and was closed for ten days. The cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about $100,000. The narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public safety reasons, and it has remained closed ever since.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=71}}

That same year, [[Ralph Pulitzer]], who had succeeded his father Joseph as publisher of the ''World'', began a drive to raise $30,000 for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night. He claimed over 80,000 contributors but failed to reach the goal. The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor—a fact that was not revealed until 1936. An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood. [[Gutzon Borglum]], who later sculpted [[Mount Rushmore]], redesigned the torch, replacing much of the original copper with stained glass. On December 2, 1916, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights, successfully illuminating the statue.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=136–139}}

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the [[Liberty Bond]] drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=148–151}}

In 1924, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] used his authority under the [[Antiquities Act]] to declare the statue a [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]].{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} The only successful suicide in the statue's history occurred five years later, when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death, glancing off the statue's breast and landing on the base.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=147}}

=== Early National Park Service years (1933–1982) ===
[[File:Liberty 1927.gif|thumb|left|Bedloe's Island in 1927, showing the statue and army buildings. The eleven-pointed walls of [[Fort Wood (New York)|Fort Wood]], which still form the statue's base, are visible.]]

In 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered the statue transferred to the [[National Park Service]] (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=136}} The [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete;{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=202}} the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=169}} The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=202}}

During World War II, the statue remained open to visitors, although it was not illuminated at night due to [[Blackout (wartime)|wartime blackouts]]. It was lit briefly on December 31, 1943, and on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944, when its lights flashed "dot-dot-dot-dash", the [[Morse code]] for [[V sign#The V campaign and the victory/freedom sign|V, for victory]]. New, powerful lighting was installed in 1944–1945, and beginning on [[V-E Day]], the statue was once again illuminated after sunset. The lighting was for only a few hours each evening, and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night, all night.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=141–143}} In 1946, the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=169}}

In 1956, an [[Act of Congress]] officially renamed Bedloe's Island as Liberty Island, a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier. The act also mentioned the efforts to found an [[American Museum of Immigration]] on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=147–148}} Nearby [[Ellis Island]] was made part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island and Liberty Island|Statue of Liberty National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1965.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} In 1972, the immigration museum, in the statue's base, was finally opened in a ceremony led by President [[Richard Nixon]]. The museum's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an [[Ellis Island#Immigration museum|immigration museum]] on Ellis Island.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=19}}

[[File:Nixon at Liberty Island.jpg|thumb|right|September 26, 1972: President [[Richard Nixon]] visits the statue to open the [[American Museum of Immigration]]. The statue's raised right foot is visible, showing that it is depicted moving forward.]]

Beginning December 26, 1971, 15 anti-Vietnam war veterans occupied the statue, flying a US flag upside down from her crown. They left December 28 following a Federal Court order.<ref>''1973 World Almanac and Book of Facts'', p. 996.</ref> The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican independence]], [[United States pro-life movement|opposition to abortion]], and opposition to [[Invasion of Grenada|US intervention in Grenada]].  Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a [[Gay Pride Parade]] rally and the annual [[Baltic states under Soviet rule (1944–91)|Captive Baltic Nations]] rally.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=72–73}}

A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the [[American Bicentennial]] in 1976. The statue was the focal point for [[Operation Sail]], a regatta of [[tall ship]]s from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4, 1976, and sailed around Liberty Island.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=143}} The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=20}}

=== Renovation and rededication (1982–2000) ===

{{See also|Liberty Weekend}}

The statue was examined in great detail by French and American engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in 1986.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=165}} In 1982, it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration. Careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure. It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of [[structural failure]]. In addition, the head had been installed {{convert|2|ft}} off center, and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind. The armature structure was badly corroded, and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=169–171}} Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936, when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed, much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=38}}

In May 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by [[Chrysler Corporation]] chair [[Lee Iacocca]], to raise the funds needed to complete the work.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=204–205}} Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350&nbsp;million in donations.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=216–218}} The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a [[cause marketing]] campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an [[American Express]] card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7&nbsp;million to the restoration project.<ref name="Daw 2006" />

In 1984, the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation. Workers erected the world's largest free-standing [[scaffolding|scaffold]],<ref name=TV /> which obscured the statue from view. [[Liquid nitrogen]] was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades, leaving two layers of [[coal tar]], originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion. [[Sodablasting|Blasting]] with [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=81}} The restorers' work was hampered by the asbestos-based substance that Bartholdi had used – ineffectively, as inspections showed – to prevent galvanic corrosion. Workers within the statue had to wear [[hazmat suit|protective gear]], dubbed "moon suits", with self-contained breathing circuits.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=76}} Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired, and new copper was added where necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=55}} The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at [[Bell Labs]], which had a patina that closely resembled the statue's; in exchange, the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=172}} The torch, found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations, was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi's unaltered torch.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=153}} Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=75}} The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one, whose flame is covered in 24-[[Fineness#Carat|carat]] gold.<ref name="faq2"/> The torch reflects the sun's rays in daytime and lighted by [[floodlight]]s at night.<ref name="faq2"/>

The entire [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] armature designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant [[stainless steel]] bars that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of [[Stainless steel#Types of stainless steel|Ferralium]], an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|pp=74–76}} To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=57}} The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from [[metal-halide lamp]]s that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=153}} Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed by a set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=71}} A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=84}} An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up to the level of the shoulder.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=88}}

July 3–6, 1986, was designated "[[Liberty Weekend]]", marking the centennial of the statue and its reopening. President Reagan presided over the rededication, with French President [[François Mitterrand]] in attendance. July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail,{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=106}} and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5.<ref name="histcult" /> In Reagan's dedication speech, he stated, "We are the keepers of the flame of liberty; we hold it high for the world to see."{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=106}}

=== Closures and reopening (2001–present) ===

[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Statue of Liberty on [[September 11, 2001]] as the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]] burn in the background]]

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the statue and Liberty Island were immediately closed to the public. The island reopened at the end of 2001, while the pedestal and statue remained off-limits. The pedestal reopened in August 2004,<ref name="histcult" /> but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency. The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.<ref name="reopen" /> New York Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] made the statue's reopening a personal crusade.<ref name="Neuman 2007-07-05" /> On May 17, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Ken Salazar]], announced that as a "special gift" to America, the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4, but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day.<ref name="reopen" />

The statue, including the pedestal and base, closed on October 29, 2011 for installation of new elevators and staircases and to bring other facilities, such as restrooms, up to code. The statue was closed to the public until October 28, 2012.<ref name="NPS StLi" /><ref name="Raja 2010-08-10" /><ref name = "SacBee" />  A day after the reopening, the statue closed again due to [[Hurricane Sandy]].<ref name="NBCNews"/>  Although the storm did not harm the statue, it destroyed some of the infrastructure on both Liberty Island and [[Ellis Island]],  severely damaging the dock used by the ferries bearing visitors to the statue.  On November 8, 2012, a Park Service spokesperson announced that both islands would remain closed for an indefinite period for repairs to be done.<ref name="NYTimes 2012-11-08" />  Due to lack of electricity on Liberty Island, a generator was installed to power temporary floodlights to illuminate the statue at night. The superintendent of [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], David Luchsinger, whose home on the island was severely damaged, stated that it would be "optimistically&nbsp;... months" before the island was reopened to the public.<ref name="NYTimes 2012-11-30" /> The statue and Liberty Island reopened to the public on July 4, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Long|first=Colleen|title= Statue of Liberty reopens as US marks July Fourth|url=http://news.yahoo.com/statue-liberty-reopens-us-marks-july-fourth-154837229.html|work=Yahoo!

== Access and attributes ==

=== Location and tourism===
[[File:Libertyferry.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Tourists aboard a [[Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises|Circle Line]] ferry arriving at [[Liberty Island]], June 1973]]

The statue is situated in [[Upper New York Bay]] on [[Liberty Island]] south of [[Ellis Island]],  which together comprise the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800.<ref name="NPS Bedloe's Island" /> As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and [[New Jersey]] that set the state border at the bay's midpoint, the original islands remain New York territory despite their location on the New Jersey side of the state line. Liberty Island is [[List of smaller islands in New York City#Manhattan|one of the islands that are part]] of the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York. Land created by [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] added to the {{convert|2.3|acre|ha}} original island at Ellis Island is New Jersey territory.<ref name="NJvsNY1998" />

No charge is made for entrance to the national monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service that all visitors must use, as private boats may not dock at the island. A concession was granted in 2007 to [[Statue Cruises]] to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing [[Circle Line Downtown|Circle Line]], which had operated the service since 1953.<ref name="Ramirez 2007-06-29" />
The ferries, which depart from [[Liberty State Park]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[Battery Park]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], also stop at Ellis Island when it is open to the public, making a combined trip possible.<ref name="ferry map" /> All ferry riders are subject to security screening, similar to airport procedures, prior to boarding.<ref name="NPS Safety and Security" /> Visitors intending to enter the statue's base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum/pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket.<ref name="faq3" /> Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown purchase a special ticket, which may be reserved up to a year in advance. A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend: ten per group, three groups per hour. Climbers may bring only medication and cameras—lockers are provided for other items—and must undergo a second security screening.<ref name="faq4" />

=== Inscriptions, plaques, and dedications ===

[[File:Liberty Island photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island.]]

There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty. A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty, designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget, Gauthier et Cie (''Cie'' is the French abbreviation analogous to ''Co.''). A presentation tablet, also bearing Bartholdi's name, declares the statue to be a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors "the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship."{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}} There is a tablet placed by the New York committee that commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal. The cornerstone also bears a plaque placed by the [[Freemason]]s.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}

In 1903, a bronze tablet that bears the text of "The New Colossus" and commemorates [[Emma Lazarus]] was presented by friends of the poet. Until the 1986 renovation, it was mounted inside the pedestal; today it resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum in the base. It is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977, celebrating the poet's life.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}

A group of statues stands at the western end of the island, honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty. Two Americans—Pulitzer and Lazarus—and three Frenchmen—Bartholdi, Laboulaye, and Eiffel—are depicted. They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=163}}

In 1984, the Statue of Liberty was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The UNESCO "Statement of Significance" describes the statue as a "masterpiece of the human spirit" that "endures as a highly potent symbol—inspiring contemplation, debate and protest—of ideals such as liberty, peace, human rights, abolition of slavery, democracy and opportunity."<ref name="unesco" />

[[File:Las Vegas NY NY Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A replica of the Statue of Liberty forms part of the exterior decor at the [[New York-New York Hotel and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]]]

Hundreds of [[replicas of the Statue of Liberty]] are displayed worldwide.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=200–201}} A smaller version of the statue, one-fourth the height of the original, was given by the American community in Paris to that city. It now stands on the [[Île aux Cygnes]], facing west toward her larger sister.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=200–201}} A replica {{convert|30|ft}} tall stood atop the Liberty Warehouse on West 64th&nbsp;Street in Manhattan for many years;{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=200–201}} it now resides at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].<ref name="Brooklyn Museum" /> In a patriotic tribute, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], as part of their [[Strengthen the Arm of Liberty]] campaign in 1949–1952, donated about two hundred replicas of the statue, made of stamped copper and {{convert|100|in}} in height, to states and municipalities across the United States.<ref name="Attoun 2007-10" /> Though not a true replica, the statue known as the [[Goddess of Democracy]] temporarily erected during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] was similarly inspired by French democratic traditions—the sculptors took care to avoid a direct imitation of the Statue of Liberty.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=103–104}} Among other recreations of New York City structures, a replica of the statue is part of the exterior of the [[New York-New York Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref name="Goldberger 1997-01-15" />

As an American icon, the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country's coinage and stamps. It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial, and on New York's 2001 entry in the [[state quarters]] series.<ref name="Statue of Liberty postage stamps" /> An image of the statue was chosen for the [[American Platinum Eagle|American Eagle platinum bullion coins]] in 1997, and it was placed on the [[reverse (coin)|reverse]], or tails, side of the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential Dollar series]] of circulating coins.<ref name="mint" /> Two images of the statue's torch appear on the current [[United States ten-dollar bill|ten-dollar bill]].<ref name="newmoney.gov $10 note" /> The statue's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 [[forever stamp]] proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino.<ref name="Severson Healey 2011-04-14" />

Depictions of the statue have been used by many regional institutions. Between 1986 and 2000, New York State issued [[vehicle registration plates of New York|license plates featuring the statue]].<ref name="NYTimes 1986-01-24" /><ref name="NYTimes 2000-01-11" /> The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]'s [[New York Liberty]] use both the statue's name and its image in their logo, in which the torch's flame doubles as a basketball.<ref name="NYTimes 1997-02-14" /> The [[New York Rangers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] depicted the statue's head on their [[third jersey]], beginning in 1997.<ref name="Lapointe 1997-01-12">

The statue is a frequent subject in popular culture. In music, it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies, as in [[Toby Keith]]'s song "[[Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)]]", and in opposition, appearing on the cover of the [[Dead Kennedys]]' album ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which protested the Reagan administration.<ref name="popcult" /> In film, the torch is the setting for the climax of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1942 movie ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]''.<ref name="Spoto 1983 p262–263" /> The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', in which it is seen half-buried in sand.<ref name="popcult" /><ref name="Greene & Slotkin 1998 p52" /> It is knocked over in the science-fiction film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''&nbsp;<ref>{{Wayback|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-movies-hated-statue-liberty.php/6|title=10 Movies That Hated The Statue Of Liberty >> Page 6 of 10|date=20140324010619|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> and in ''[[Cloverfield]]'' the head is ripped off.<ref>{{Wayback|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18028350|title='Cloverfield' Release Will Be Test of Online Hype : NPR|date=20080414143708|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> In [[Jack Finney]]'s time-travel novel ''[[Time and Again (novel)|Time and Again]]'', the right arm of the statue, on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park, plays a crucial role.<ref name="Darrach 1970-06-26" /> [[Robert Holdstock]], consulting editor of ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', wondered in 1979,

<blockquote>
Where would science fiction be without the Statue of Liberty? For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted <nowiki>[E]</nowiki>arth—giants have uprooted it, aliens have found it curious&nbsp;... the symbol of Liberty, of optimism, has become a symbol of science fiction's pessimistic view of the future."<ref name="Nicholls 1979 p14" />
