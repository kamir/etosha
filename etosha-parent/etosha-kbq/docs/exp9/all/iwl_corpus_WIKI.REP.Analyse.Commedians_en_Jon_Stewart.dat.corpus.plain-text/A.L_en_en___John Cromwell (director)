'''Elwood Dager Cromwell''' (December 23, 1887 – September 26, 1979), known as '''John Cromwell''', was an American film actor, director and producer.

==Biography==
Born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], Cromwell made his New York City stage debut in Marian De Forest's adaptation of ''[[Little Women]]'' (1912) on Broadway. It was a hit and ran for 184 performances. He then directed the play ''The Painted Woman'' (1913), which failed. Next, he acted in and co-directed with [[Frank Craven]] the hit show ''Too Many Cooks'' (1914), which ran for 223 performances.

Cromwell played Charles Lomax in the original Broadway production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Major Barbara]]'' (1915), about a woman of [[The Salvation Army]], and he played the role as Capt. Kearney in the revival of Shaw's ''[[Captain Brassbound's Conversion]]'' (1916). Among others, he also had a role in ''[[The Racket (1927 play)|The Racket]]'' (1927), which ran for 119 performances. The following year while the Broadway company was playing ''The Racket'' in Los Angeles, Cromwell was signed to a ''Paramount Pictures'' contract as an actor and student director.

===Career===

====Film and television====
He made his motion picture debut playing Walter Babbing in the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''The Dummy'' (1929), a [[sound film|talkie]] starring [[Ruth Chatterton]] and [[Fredric March]], with [[Jack Oakie]], and [[ZaSu Pitts]]. His work as co-director with [[Edward Sutherland]] on the musical/romance ''Close Harmony'' starring [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]], [[Nancy Carroll]], Harry Green, and Jack Oakie, and the musical/drama ''The Dance of Life'' (both released in 1929), was so skillful he was allowed to begin directing without collaboration, beginning with ''The Mighty'' that same year starring [[George Bancroft]], in which he also played the part of Mr. Jamieson.

He directed ''[[Tom Sawyer (1930 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' (1930) starring [[Jackie Coogan]] in the title role; [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s ''[[Ann Vickers]]'' (1933) starring [[Irene Dunne]], [[Walter Huston]], [[Conrad Nagel]], [[Bruce Cabot]], and [[Edna May Oliver]]; and [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934) starring [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Frances Dee]].

The latter two movies were at [[RKO]] and both had censorship trouble. In the novel by Lewis, Ann Vickers is a [[birth control]] advocate and reformer who has an extramarital affair. The screenplay was finally approved by the [[Production Code]] when the [[film studio|studio]] agreed to make Vickers an unmarried woman at the time of her affair, thus eliminating the issue of [[adultery]]. The screenplay for Maugham's ''Of Human Bondage'' was unacceptable because the prostitute, Mildred Rogers (played by Davis), whom the club-footed medical student, Philip Carey (played by Howard), falls in love with, comes down with [[syphilis]]. [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]]'s office demanded that Mildred be made a waitress who comes down with [[Tuberculosis|TB]], and that she be married to Carey's rival with whom she runs off with and becomes pregnant. RKO agreed to everything to keep from having to pay a $25,000 fine.

====Film/Broadway====
Cromwell won the 1952 [[Tony Award|Tony]] for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance as John Gray in ''[[Point of No Return (play)|Point of No Return]]'' (1951) starring [[Henry Fonda]]. Of his [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] roles on Broadway, Cromwell played Paris, kinsman to the prince, in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1935) starring [[Katharine Cornell]], who also produced the play, and [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], in the title roles; Rosencrantz in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1936), which was staged and produced by [[Guthrie McClintic]] (Cornell's husband, who had been married to [[Estelle Winwood]]), starring [[John Gielgud]] in the title role, [[Judith Anderson]] as Gertrude, and [[Lillian Gish]] as Ophelia; and Lennox in the revival of ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1948) starring [[Michael Redgrave]] in the title role and [[Flora Robson]] as Lady Macbeth, with [[Julie Harris]] as a witch, [[Martin Balsam]] as one of the three murderers, and [[Beatrice Straight]] as Lady MacDuff.

Cromwell also appeared on Broadway in the role of Brother Martin Ladvenu in Katharine Cornell's revival of ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' (1936), which was directed by Guthrie McClintic; and as Freddy Eynsford Hill in [[Cedric Hardwicke]]'s revival of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1945) starring [[Gertrude Lawrence]] as Eliza Doolittle and [[Raymond Massey]] as Henry Higgins.

Among the movies Cromwell directed are ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1936) starring [[Freddie Bartholomew]] and [[Dolores Costello]]; ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1937) starring [[Ronald Colman]] and [[Madeleine Carroll]], with Raymond Massey, [[Mary Astor]], [[David Niven]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]]; ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]'' (1938) starring [[Charles Boyer]] and [[Hedy Lamarr]]; ''[[Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)|Abe Lincoln in Illinois]]'' (1940) starring Raymond Massey, [[Gene Lockhart]], and [[Ruth Gordon]]; ''Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake'' (1942) starring [[Tyrone Power]], [[Gene Tierney]]; ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944) starring [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Shirley Temple]], [[Robert Walker (actor)|Robert Walker]], and [[Monty Woolley]], with [[Hattie McDaniel]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], [[Alla Nazimova]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Keenan Wynn]]; ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' (1946) starring [[Irene Dunne]], [[Rex Harrison]], [[Linda Darnell]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], and [[Gale Sondergaard]]; ''[[Dead Reckoning (film)|Dead Reckoning]]'' (1947) starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lizabeth Scott]]; the women's prison drama ''[[Caged]]'' (1950) and the noir crime/drama ''[[The Racket (1951 film)|The Racket]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Lizabeth Scott]], and [[Robert Ryan]], which Cromwell had appeared in onstage in New York and on tour.

Cromwell was president of the [[Directors Guild of America|Screen Directors Guild]] from 1944 to 1946. He was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]]ed<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Co-Du/Cromwell-John.html]</ref> in Hollywood from 1951 to 1958 for his political affiliations.

Cromwell was cast by [[Robert Altman]] in the role as Mr. Rose in the movie ''[[3 Women (film)|3 Women]]'' (1977) starring [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Sissy Spacek]], and as Bishop Martin in ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978) starring [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Vittorio Gassman]] and [[Lillian Gish]].
