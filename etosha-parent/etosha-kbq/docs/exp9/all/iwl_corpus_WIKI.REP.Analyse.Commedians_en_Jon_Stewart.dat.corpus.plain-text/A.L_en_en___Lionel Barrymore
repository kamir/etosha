'''Lionel Barrymore''' (April 28, 1878 – November 15, 1954) was an American actor of stage, screen and radio as well as a film director.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', November 17, 1954.</ref>  He won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance in ''[[A Free Soul]]'' (1931), and remains perhaps best known for the role of the villainous [[Mr. Potter]] character in [[Frank Capra]]'s 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. He was a member of the theatrical [[Barrymore family]].

==Early life==
Lionel Barrymore was born '''Lionel Herbert Blythe''' in [[Philadelphia]], the son of actors [[Georgiana Drew]] Barrymore and [[Maurice Barrymore]]. He was the elder brother of [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]] and [[John Barrymore]], the uncle of [[John Drew Barrymore]], [[Diana Barrymore]], Dolores Barrymore, Sam, Ethel, and John Drew Colt and the [[grand-uncle]] of [[Drew Barrymore]]. Barrymore was raised a [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F63E59177B93CBA8178AD95F408585F9 | work=The New York Times | title=NOTABLES ATTEND BARRYMORE RITES; Hollywood Stars Join Throng at Burial of Member of Famed Acting Family | date=November 19, 1954 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>  He attended the [[Episcopal Academy]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mainlinetimes.com/WebApp/appmanager/JRC/SingleWeekly?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pg_wk_article&r21.pgpath=%2FMLT%2FLife&r21.content=%2FMLT%2FLife%2FHeadlineList_Story_2429913 | title = A Quiz about Main Line Schools | publisher = The Main Line Times | date = 2008-09-03 | accessdate = 2008-12-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In her autobiography, [[Eleanor Farjeon]] recalled that when she and Barrymore were friends as toddlers, she would take off her shoes and he would kiss her feet.<ref>Farjeon, Eleanor, ''A Nursery in the Nineties'' (Gollancz, 1935).</ref>

He was married twice, to actresses [[Doris Rankin]] and [[Irene Fenwick]], a one-time lover of his brother John. Doris's sister Gladys was married to Lionel's uncle [[Sidney Drew]], which made Gladys both his aunt and sister-in-law.

Doris Rankin bore Lionel two daughters, Ethel Barrymore II (b. 1908) and Mary Barrymore (b. 1916).<ref>''The Barrymores in Hollywood'' by James Kotsilibas Davis, c.1981;...Davis talks about the second girl dying while Lionel was working for Metro Studios which was formed in 1916.</ref> Neither child survived infancy, though Mary lived a few months. Barrymore never truly recovered from the deaths of his girls, and their loss undoubtedly strained his marriage to Doris Rankin, which ended in 1923. Years later, Barrymore developed a fatherly affection for [[Jean Harlow]], who was born about the same time as his two daughters and would have been about their age. When Jean died in 1937, Lionel and [[Clark Gable]] mourned her as though she had been family.

==Stage career==
[[File:Lionel Barrymore 2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lionel Barrymore as a young man.]]
Barrymore began his [[theatre|stage]] career in the mid-1890s, acting with his formidable grandmother [[Louisa Lane Drew]]. He appeared on Broadway in his early twenties with his uncle [[John Drew Jr.]] in such plays as ''The Second in Command'' (1901) and ''The Mummy and the Hummingbird'' (1902), both produced by [[Charles Frohman]]. In 1905 Lionel and his siblings, John and Ethel, were all being groomed under the tutelage of Frohman. That year Lionel appeared with John in a short play called ''Pantaloon'' while John appeared with Ethel in ''Alice-Sit-By-The-Fire''.

In 1910, after he and Doris had spent many years in [[Paris]], Lionel came back to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where he established his reputation as a dramatic and character actor. He and his wife often acted together on stage. He proved his talent in many plays, including ''[[Peter Ibbetson]]'' (1917) (with brother John), ''The Copperhead'' (1918) (with Doris), and ''The Jest'' (1919) (again with John). Lionel gave a short-lived performance as MacBeth in 1921. The play was not successful and more than likely convinced Lionel to permanently return to films. One of Lionel's last plays was ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh'' (1923) with his second wife, Irene Fenwick. This play would later be made into a 1928 silent film starring Lionel's friend, [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]

==Film career==
Barrymore began making films about 1911 with [[David Wark Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] at the [[Biograph Studios]]. There are claims that he made an earlier film with Griffith called ''The Paris Hat'' (1908) but no such movie exists. Lionel and Doris were in Paris in 1908, where Lionel attended art school and where their first baby, Ethel, was born. Lionel mentions in his autobiography, ''We Barrymores'', that he and Doris were in France when [[Louis Bleriot|Bleriot]] flew the [[English Channel|channel]] on July 25, 1909.

Entering films the same year his uncle [[Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]] began a film career at [[Vitagraph]], Barrymore made ''[[The Battle (1911 film)|The Battle]]'' (1911), ''[[The New York Hat]]'' (1912), ''[[Friends (1912 film)|Friends]]''  and ''[[Three Friends (film)|Three Friends]]'' (1913). In 1915 he co-starred with [[Lillian Russell]] in a movie called ''[[Wildfire (1915 film)|Wildfire]]'', one of the legendary Russell's few film appearances. He also made a foray into directing at Biograph. The last silent film he directed, ''[[Life's Whirlpool]]'' ([[Metro Pictures]]  1917), starred his sister, Ethel. 
[[Image:The Devil's Garden (1920) ad.jpg|right|thumb|Lionel and first wife [[Doris Rankin|Doris]] (in rocking chair) in 1920 silent film ''[[The Devil's Garden]]''.]]
In early 1920, Barrymore reprised his title role in the stage play, ''[[The Copperhead (1920 film)|The Copperhead]]'' (1920), in a Paramount Artcraft film of the same name.

Before the formation of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1924, Barrymore forged a good relationship with [[Louis B. Mayer]] early on at [[Metro Pictures]]. He made several silent features for Metro, most of them now lost. He occasionally freelanced, returning to Griffith in 1924 to film ''[[America (1924 film)|America]]''. His last film for Griffith was in 1928's ''[[Drums of Love]]''.

[[File:Lionel Barrymore & Irene Fenwick.jpg|thumb|left|150px|With second wife [[Irene Fenwick]] Taken in 1923]]

After Lionel and Doris divorced in 1923, he married [[Irene Fenwick]]. The two went to Italy to film ''[[The Eternal City (1923 film)|The Eternal City]]'' for Metro Pictures in Rome, combining work with their honeymoon. In 1924, he went to Germany to star in British producer-director [[Herbert Wilcox]]'s Anglo-German co-production ''Decameron Nights'', filmed at [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]'s Babelsberg studios outside Berlin.

Prior to his marriage to Irene, he and his brother John engaged in a dispute over the issue of Irene's [[chastity]] in the wake of her having been one of John's lovers. The brothers didn't speak again for two years and weren't seen together until the premiere of John's film ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' in 1926, by which time they had patched up their differences. In 1924, he left Broadway for [[Hollywood]]. He starred as Frederick Harmon in director [[Henri Diamant-Berger]]'s drama ''[[Fifty-Fifty (1925 film)|Fifty-Fifty]]'' (1925) opposite [[Hope Hampton]] and [[Louise Glaum]], and made several other freelance motion pictures, including ''[[The Bells (1926 film)|The Bells]]'' (Chadwick Pictures 1926) with a then-unknown [[Boris Karloff]]. After 1926, however, he worked almost exclusively for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, appearing opposite such luminaries as [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Spencer Tracy]], his brother John and sister Ethel.
[[File:Lionel Barrymore in David Copperfield trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barrymore in ''[[David Copperfield (1935 film)|David Copperfield]]'' trailer, 1935]]
On the occasional loan-out, Barrymore had a big success with [[Gloria Swanson]] in 1928's ''[[Sadie Thompson]]'' and the aforementioned Griffith film, ''Drums of Love''. Talkies were now a reality and Barrymore's stage-trained voice recorded well in sound tests. In 1929, he returned to directing films. During this early and imperfect sound film period, he made the controversial ''His Glorious Night'' with John Gilbert, ''Madame X'' starring [[Ruth Chatterton]], and ''[[The Rogue Song|Rogue Song]]'', [[Laurel & Hardy]]'s first color film. Barrymore returned to acting in front of the camera in 1931. In that year, he won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] for his role as an alcoholic lawyer in ''[[A Free Soul]]'' (1931), after being nominated in 1930 for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] for ''[[Madame X (1929 film)|Madame X]]''. He could play many characters, like the evil [[Rasputin]] in the 1932 ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'' (in which he co-starred with siblings John Barrymore and Ethel Barrymore) and the ailing Oliver Jordan in ''[[Dinner at Eight (1933 movie)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1933 – also with John Barrymore, although they had no scenes together).

During the [[1930 in film|1930]]s and [[1940 in film|1940]]s, he became stereotyped as grouchy but sweet elderly men in such films as ''[[The Mysterious Island (1929 film)|The Mysterious Island]]'' (1929), ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932, with John Barrymore), ''[[Captains Courageous]]'' (1937), ''[[You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938), ''[[On Borrowed Time]]'' (1939, with [[Cedric Hardwicke]]), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946),  and ''[[Key Largo (movie)|Key Largo]]'' (1948).

[[File:Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter.jpg|thumb|200px|As the avaricious  [[Mr. Potter]] in ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', 1946.]]

In a series of [[Doctor Kildare]] movies in the [[1930 in film|1930]]s and [[1940 in film|1940]]s, he played the irascible Doctor Gillespie, a role he repeated in an [[Dr. Kildare|MGM radio series]] that debuted in New York in 1950 and was later syndicated. He also played the title role in the 1940s radio series, ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]''. Barrymore had broken his hip in an accident, hence he played Gillespie in a wheelchair. Later, his worsening arthritis kept him in the chair.<ref>Landazuri, Margaret. [http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=86557 ''Archives Spotlight: Young Dr. Kildare'']. Turner Classic Movies.com. Accessed: 7 December 2007.</ref> The injury also precluded his playing [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in the 1938 MGM film version of ''[[A Christmas Carol (1938 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'', a role Barrymore played every year but two (1936, replaced by brother John Barrymore and 1938, replaced by Orson Welles) on the radio from 1934 through 1953. He also had a role with Clark Gable in [[Lone Star (1952 film)|Lone Star]] in 1952.
His final film appearance was a cameo in ''[[Main Street to Broadway]]'', an MGM musical comedy released in 1953. His sister [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]] also appeared in the film.

Perhaps his best known role, thanks to perennial Christmastime replays on television, was [[Mr. Potter]], the miserly and mean-spirited banker in  ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) opposite [[James Stewart]]. The role suggested that of the "unreformed" stage of Barrymore's "Scrooge" characterization. Lionel's wife, Irene, died on Christmas Eve of 1936 and Lionel did not perform his annual Scrooge that year. John filled in as Scrooge for his grieving brother.

==Politics==
Barrymore registered for the draft during World War II despite his age and disability, to encourage others to enlist in the military.<ref name="mgm2">{{cite episode | title=The Lion Reigns Supreme | series=MGM: When the Lion Roared | credits=Stewart, Patrick (host) | season=1}}</ref> He loathed the [[income tax]]. He expressed an interest in appearing on television in the 1950s but felt compelled to remain loyal to his old friend and employer, Louis B. Mayer and MGM.<ref>''The Barrymores'' by Hollis Alpert c.1964</ref><ref>[http://www.thenation.com/blog/174178/when-eleanor-roosevelt-got-mgm-fire-lionel-barrymore-pro-bomb-epic# "When Eleanor Roosevelt Got MGM to Fire Lionel Barrymore From a Pro Bomb Epic; by Greg Mitchell, May 5 2013]</ref>

Barrymore was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. In [[U.S. presidential election, 1944|1944]], he attended the massive rally organized by [[David O. Selznick]] in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] in support of the [[Thomas E. Dewey|Dewey]]-[[John W. Bricker|Bricker]] ticket as well as [[governor of California|Governor]] [[Earl Warren]] of California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. The gathering drew 93,000, with [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as the [[master of ceremonies]] and with short speeches by [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Walt Disney]]. Among the others in attendance were [[Ann Sothern]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[William Bendix]], and [[Walter Pidgeon]].<ref>[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/clapboard-conservatives/ Commentary Magazine www.commentarymagazine.com/article/clapboard-conservatives/]</ref><ref>David M. Jordan, ''FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944'' (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2011), p. 231</ref>

===Medical issues===
Several sources argue that arthritis alone confined Barrymore to a wheelchair.<ref>Marzano, p. 49; Willian, p. 37; Silvers, p. 234; [http://books.google.com/books?id=-kEEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA56&dq=%22Lionel%20Barrymore%22%20arthritis&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q=%22Lionel%20Barrymore%22%20arthritis&f=false "Movie of the Week: 'On Borrowed Time'."] ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]].'' July 10, 1939, p. 56, accessed 2013-05-10.</ref><ref name="Norden145">Norden, p. 145.</ref> The onset of the arthritis is not clear. Film historian Jeanine Basinger says it was serious by at least 1928, when Barrymore made ''Sadie Thompson''.<ref>Basinger, p. 230.</ref> Screenwriter [[Anita Loos]] claimed that the arthritis was so bad by 1929, Barrymore was taking large quantities of [[morphine]].<ref>Wayne, p. 105.</ref> Film historian David Wallace says it was "well known" that Barrymore was "addicted" to morphine due to arthritis by 1929, when Louis B. Mayer hired Barrymore to direct ''[[Redemption (1930 film)|Redemption]]'' (a film from which Barrymore was removed).<ref>Wallace, p. 78.</ref> A history of Oscar-winning actors, however, says Barrymore was only "suffering" from arthritis, not crippled by it.<ref>Bergan, Fuller, and Malcolm, p. 32.</ref> Marie Dressler biographer Matthew Kennedy notes that when Barrymore won his Best Oscar award in 1930, the arthritis was still so minor that it only made him limp a little as he went on stage to accept the honor.<ref>Kennedy, p. 177.</ref> Despite these rumors Barrymore can be seen being quite physical in late silent films like ''[[The Thirteenth Hour]]'' and ''[[West of Zanzibar (1928 film)|West of Zanzibar]]'' where he can be seen climbing out of a window.

Others claim that Barrymore's broken hip alone was the cause of Barrymore's incapacity. Paul Donnelly says Barrymore's inability to walk was caused by a drawing table falling on him in 1936, breaking Barrymore's hip.<ref name="Donnelly68" /> Barrymore tripped over a cable while filming ''Saratoga'' in 1937, and broke his hip again.<ref>Culbertson and Randall, p. 141.</ref> (Film historian Robert A. Osborne says Barrymore also suffered a broken kneecap.)<ref name="Osborne">Osborne, p. 31.</ref> The injury was painful enough that Donnelly, quoting Barrymore, says that [[Louis B. Mayer]] bought Barrymore $400 worth of [[cocaine]] every day to help him cope with the pain and allow him to sleep.<ref name="Donnelly68">Donnelly, p. 68.</ref> Author David Schwartz says the hip fracture never healed, which was why Barrymore could not walk,<ref>Schwartz, p. 241.</ref> while MGM historian John Douglas Eames claims that the injury was "crippling".<ref>Eames, p. 139.</ref> Barrymore himself said in 1951, that it was breaking his hip twice that kept him in the wheelchair. He said he had no other problems, and that the hip healed well, but it made walking exceptionally difficult.<ref>Barrymore and Shipp, p. 287.</ref> Film historian Allen Eyles reached the same conclusion.<ref>Eyles, p. 118.</ref>

However, Lew Ayres biographer Lesley Coffin and Louis B. Mayer biographer Scott Eyman argue that it was the combination of the broken hip as well as Barrymore's worsening arthritis that put him in a wheelchair.<ref>Coffin, p. 72.</ref><ref name="Eyman219">Eyman, p. 219.</ref>

Syphilis has also been suggested as a cause of Barrymore's disability. Syphilis can severely affect joint movement. Barrymore family biographer Margot Peters says that close Barrymore friends [[Gene Fowler]] and James Doane both said Barrymore's arthritis was caused by [[syphilis]], which they say he contracted in 1925.<ref>Peters, p. 438, 597.</ref> Eyman, however, explicitly rejects this hypothesis.<ref name="Eyman219" />

Whatever the cause of his disability, Barrymore's performance in ''Captains Courageous'' in 1937 was one of the last times he would be seen standing and walking unassisted.<ref>Block and Wilson, p. 203.</ref> Afterward, Barrymore was able to get about for a short period of time on crutches even though he was in great pain.<ref name="Osborne" /> During the filming of 1938's ''You Can't Take It With You'', the pain of standing with crutches was so severe that Barrymore required hourly shots of painkillers.<ref name="Norden145" /> By 1938, Barrymore used a wheelchair exclusively and never walked again.<ref>Reid, p. 193.</ref>  He could, however, stand for short periods of time such as at his brother's funeral being held by niece Diana Barrymore, much like FDR being held by one of his sons.<ref name="Eyman219" />

==Composer==
Barrymore was also a prolific composer. His works ranged from solo piano pieces to large-scale orchestral works, such as "Tableau Russe". His piano compositions, "Scherzo Grotesque" and "Song Without Words", were published by G. Schirmer in 1945.

==Graphic artist==
Barrymore was a skillful graphic artist. For years, he maintained an artist's shop and studio attached to his home in Los Angeles. His etchings and drawings are prized by collectors around the world.

==Death==
Lionel Barrymore died on November 15, 1954 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Van Nuys]], [[California]], and was entombed in the [[Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[East Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Lionel Barrymore Is Dead at 76''. |url= |quote= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=November 16, 1954|accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref>

Lionel Barrymore is honored with two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], in the motion picture and radio categories. He is also a member of the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]], along with his siblings, [[Ethel Barrymore|Ethel]] and [[John Barrymore|John]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehalloffame.org/members.html|title=Theater Hall of Fame members|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
*On the TV series M*A*S*H,in the 1976 episode "The Novocaine Mutiny"...Dr. Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda)gets angry with Dr./Major Frank Burns's (Larry Linville) medical ineptness and tells him, "Now get out there and practice medicine or I'm gonna report you to Lionel Barrymore!" (Referring to Barrymore's Dr. Gillespie character in the "Dr. Kildare" films of the 1930s & 1940s.)


* In the classic animated series ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'' in the episode "Turu the Terrible" the villain is a character called 'Deen'. He is elderly and wheelchair bound and is in command of a large [[pteranodon]], an apparent survivor from the prehistoric dinosaur age. While Deen does not look like Lionel Barrymore, he is voiced by actor [[Everett Sloane]] whose voice is a dead ringer for Barrymore's.

* In the animated series ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'', the recurring villain Simon Bar Sinister's voice is an impersonation of Barrymore.

* In another animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode "Theatre of Doom" Vincent Van Ghoul (a parody of [[Vincent Price]]) remarked that he saw Barrymore smashed his own play with a pipe.

* In the 1948 cartoon short ''[[Hot Cross Bunny]]'', Bugs Bunny does an impression of Barrymore as Dr. Gillespie.

* In a 1968 episode of ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', "The Night of the Gruesome Games", actor [[William Schallert]] playing a crazed Victorian millionaire affects a credible Barrymore impersonation wheelchair and all. Likewise, series regular [[Ross Martin]] (Artemus Gordon), impersonating Scallert's character, does a fine Lionel impersonation.
