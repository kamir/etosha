'''''The Daily Show''''' (known currently as '''''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''''') is an [[Emmy Award]] winning [[news]] [[parody]] [[television program]]. It airs each Monday through Thursday on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]]. The half-hour long program was first shown on Monday, July 22, 1996. 

It was first [[Television host|hosted]] by Craig Kilborn. Kilborn acted as its [[anchorman]] until December 1998. [[Jon Stewart]] took over as host in January 1999. Many changes were made to the program at that time. Under Stewart, ''The Daily Show'' has become more strongly focused around [[politics]] and the [[United States|national]] [[media]]. It is much different to the more [[fictional character|character]]-driven [[comedy]] which was shown more during Kilborn's time on the program.
