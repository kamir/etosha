The satirical clip featured Bee mentioning how [[Christmas]] was the only religious holiday that's also a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday in the United States]], with O'Reilly talking about "[[Secularity|Secular]] Central...excuse me, Comedy Central".<ref>''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel, December 2, 2005.</ref><ref>''The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly'', December 2, 2005.</ref> [[Jon Stewart]] discussed this on the air, claiming he could not recall doing that piece. Stewart invited Bee out, and unlike in the clip that aired on ''Factor'', Bee was visibly eight months pregnant.
