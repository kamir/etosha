'''Roseann''' "'''Rosie'''" '''O'Donnell'''<!--- No middle name as stated in biography ---> (born March 21, 1962)<ref name="biography.com">{{cite web|title=Rosie O'Donnell Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/rosie-odonnell-9542144|work=[[The Biography Channel]]|publisher=A+E Television Networks|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}</ref> is an American comedian, actress, author, and television personality. She has also been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, [[LGBT social movements|lesbian rights]] activist, television producer, and collaborative partner in the lesbian family vacation company [[R Family Vacations]].

O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1984. A TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience and from 1996 to 2002, she hosted ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'', which won multiple [[Emmy Awards]]. During this time, she wrote her first [[memoir]], ''[[Find Me (book)|Find Me]]'', and developed the nickname "Queen of Nice" as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts. She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her For All Kids foundation and promoted other charity projects, encouraging celebrities on her show to also take part.

O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]], stating "I'm a [[dyke (slang)|dyke]]!" two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to [[LGBT adoption in the United States|gay adoption]] issues. O'Donnell is a [[foster care|foster]] and [[adoption|adoptive]] mother. She was named "Person of the Year" in a 2002 cover story by ''[[The Advocate]]'' with an in-depth interview by the magazine's editor-in-chief, Judy Wieder. In May 2003, she became a regular contributor to the magazine. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues.

In 2006, O'Donnell became a moderator on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. Her strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies, including an on-air dispute regarding the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s policies with the [[Iraq War]], resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007, O'Donnell released her second memoir, ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at ''The View''. From 2009 to 2011, she hosted ''Rosie Radio'' on [[Sirius XM Radio]]. In 2011, O'Donnell signed on with the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]] to return to daytime TV with ''[[The Rosie Show]]''. The network cancelled the show due to low ratings on March 16, 2012, and the last show aired on March 29, 2012. In July 2014, Rosie O'Donnell was rehired to join ''The View'' as a co-host for the series' eighteenth season. O'Donnell announced in February 2015 her decision to depart the series again, this time citing personal reasons for her departure.

With New York City as the show's homebase, O'Donnell displayed her love of Broadway musicals and plays by having cast members as guests, encouraging the audience to see shows, premiering production numbers as well as promoting shows with ticket giveaways.

After the [[Columbine shootings]], O'Donnell became an outspoken supporter of [[gun control]] and a major figure in the [[Million Mom March]].<ref name="Amy Paulson">{{cite news|last=Paulson|first=Amy|title='Million Mom March' organizers hope to spur congressional action on gun legislation|work=[[CNN]]|date=May 8, 2000|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/08/million.mom/index.html|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, "You are not allowed to own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallant|first=Paul|last2=Eisen|first2=Joanne|last3=Kopel|first3=Dave|title=Her Own Bodyguard|work=[[National Review]]|date=January 24, 2002|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint012402.html|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> O'Donnell previously had remarked, "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem."<ref>{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen|title=A Bodyguard for Rosie's Kid|publisher=People|date=September 11, 1998|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,617858,00.html|accessdate=July 20, 2007}}</ref> In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed [[Tom Selleck]], who was promoting ''[[The Love Letter (1999 film)|The Love Letter]]''.

She said at the end of the segment the conversation had "not gone the way I had hoped" and added "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize, because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today."<ref name="NRA Winning Team">{{cite web|title=TRANSCRIPT: Tom Selleck Visits "The Rosie O'Donnell Show"|publisher=NRA Winning Team|url=http://www.nrawinningteam.com/norosie.html|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}</ref><ref name="Otherone">{{cite web|first =Otherone|title=Transcript of Tom Selleck & Rosie O'Donnell's NRA Discussion|publisher=JLRweb|url =http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html|accessdate=July 11, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302075026/http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html|archivedate=March 2, 2008}}</ref> Around the same time, the cast from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" from the song "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" and agreed to perform "My Defenses Are Down" instead.<ref name="Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie">{{cite news|title=Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie|work=People|date=March 1, 1999|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,616006,00.html|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

Later in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with [[Kmart]] as their spokeswoman, as gun enthusiasts complained that she shouldn't be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that Kmart sells hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons and does so legally which she supports.

O'Donnell stated that the security firm contracted by [[Warner Bros.]] requested the gun.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who encouraged viewers to visit and support the [[performing arts]]. She announced that she would donate 1 million dollars for aid in the rescue efforts and encouraged other celebrities and citizens alike to "give till it hurts".<ref>{{cite news|title=O'donnell donates $1 million in aid|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/2001/09/20/usn_millionin.shtml|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Amarillo Globe-News]]|date=September 20, 2001|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

In 2002, she left her talk show.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Jeannie|title=Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 27, 2002}}</ref> The show was replaced by ''[[The Caroline Rhea Show]]'', with comedian [[Caroline Rhea]], which ran for one additional season.

In September 2006, O'Donnell replaced [[Meredith Vieira]] as a co-host and moderator of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', a daytime women-oriented talk show.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|title=Rosie O'Donnell to Join the Cast of 'The View'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/arts/television/29rosi.html|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 29, 2006}}</ref> [[Star Jones]], a co-host on the show, quit, with some speculating Jones's conservative views would be in constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding that it must have been through [[gastric bypass surgery]], rather than dieting and exercise alone as Jones had insisted, which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two. (Jones later confirmed that surgery was involved.) O'Donnell is credited with keeping the show's "[[word of mouth|buzz factor]] up".<ref name=buzz>[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/view/192276 "The Future of The View"] ''TV Guide'', June 3, 2006.

O'Donnell gave the show a more political slant, and she and fellow comic [[Joy Behar]] often gave strong opinions against former President Bush's [[Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign]] policies, including the [[Iraq War]]. As a conservative counterpoint, [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] would usually support the [[Presidency of George W.

===Broadway production===
In late 2003, O'Donnell brought the musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' to Broadway.

==Personal life==
O'Donnell was a resident of [[Nyack, New York]] after the purchase in 1996 of "Pretty Penny," a Victorian river home that had previously served as the home of [[Helen Hayes]], the American actress and "First Lady of the American Theater." O'Donnell sold the home to businessman [[Edward M. Kopko]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paik|first=Felicia|title=Private Properties|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB949622673396879408|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 4, 2000}}</ref>

===Coming out===
In her January 31, 2002 appearance on the sitcom ''[[Will & Grace]]'', she played a lesbian mom. A month later as part of her act at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at [[Caroline's Comedy Club]] O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian, announcing "I'm a [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]!" "I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing. ... People are confused, they're shocked, like this is a big revelation to somebody."<ref name=Coy2002>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Jeannie|title=Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 27, 2002}}</ref> The announcement came two months before the end of the hosting of her talk show. Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to the [[gay adoption]] issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.

[[Diane Sawyer]] interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, episode of ''[[Primetime (TV series)|PrimeTime Thursday]]''. O'Donnell told ''[[USA Today]]'' that she chose to talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, "I would like to talk about my life and how (the case) pertains to me." She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who face having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law won't let them adopt because Florida bans gay or [[bisexual]] people from adopting.<ref name=Coy2002/> O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of [[Tom Cruise]] on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' as deceptive.<ref name=Coy2002/> She responded in her act stating, "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade.
