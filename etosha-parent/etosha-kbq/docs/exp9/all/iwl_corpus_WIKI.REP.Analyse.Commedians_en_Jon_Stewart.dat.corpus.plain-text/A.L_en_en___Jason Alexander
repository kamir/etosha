At [[Boston University]], Alexander wanted to pursue classical acting, but a professor redirected him toward comedy after noticing his physique, remarking, "I know your heart and soul are Hamlet, but you will never play Hamlet."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laskowski|first1=Amy|title=Seinfeld's Costanza Gives Master Class in Acting at CFA|journal=Bostonia|date=February 2015|page=4|publisher=Boston University}}</ref> He was later given an honorary degree in 1995.

==Acting career==

===Stage career===
Alexander began his acting career on the [[New York]] stage and is an accomplished singer and dancer. On [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], he appeared in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]],'' [[John Kander|Kander]] & [[Fred Ebb|Ebb]]'s ''[[The Rink (musical)|The Rink]]'', [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Broadway Bound]]'', ''Accomplice'', and ''[[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]]'', for which he garnered the 1989 [[Tony Award]] for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Returning to the stage in 2003, Alexander was cast in a successful run, opposite [[Martin Short]], in the Los Angeles production of [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Kenneth Jones |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/70909.html | work=Playbill | date=July 17, 2002 | title=Mel Brooks Gets Jason Alexander and Martin Short for L.A. Producers, Starting May 2, 2003 | accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> Alexander also appeared with [[Kelsey Grammer]] in the 2004 [[A Christmas Carol (2004 film)|musical adaptation]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', playing [[Jacob Marley]] to Grammer's [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. He continues to appear in live stage shows, including [[Barbra Streisand]]'s memorable birthday party for Stephen Sondheim at the Hollywood Bowl, in which he appeared with [[Angela Lansbury]], performing selections from ''[[Sweeney Todd]]''. Alexander was recently named the Artistic Director of Reprise Theatre Company in Los Angeles, where he previously directed ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]''. He is scheduled to direct the upcoming revival of ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' at Reprise.

===Television===
Alexander first found success on television in the commercial for the McDonald's McDLT.  However, he is best known as one of the key cast members of the award-winning television [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (1989–1998), in which he played [[George Costanza]] ([[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld's character]]'s best friend since childhood).

Before ''Seinfeld'', he starred in a short-lived [[CBS]] sitcom called ''[[Everything's Relative (1987 TV series)|Everything's Relative]]'' in 1987 which lasted six episodes. Concurrently with his ''Seinfeld'' role, Alexander provided the voice of the lead character in the [[cult following|cult]] animated series ''[[Duckman]]'' (1994–1997). Alexander also voiced [[Catbert]], the evil director of human resources, in the short-lived ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' animated series based on the popular comic strip.

Alexander made cameo appearances in the second season of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', playing himself. Alexander also appeared in the seventh season of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'', along with the other three principal ''[[Seinfeld]]'' cast members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/03/seinfeld-cast-t.html |author=Rice, Lynette|title=Exclusive: 'Seinfeld' cast to appear on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'|publisher=[[EW.com]]|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> He also had a part in the ABC sitcom ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', as Al "Sexual" Harris (who frequently engaged in [[sexual harassment]]) as well as other voices. Despite a relatively successful career in film and stage, Alexander never managed to repeat his ''Seinfeld''-level of success in television. 2001 marked his first post-''Seinfeld'' return to prime-time television: the heavily promoted but short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' (which was canceled after five episodes). Alexander partially blames the lack of success on the mood of the country after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].<ref name=parade>{{cite news | title = In Step With: Jason Alexander | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = April 3, 2005 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_04-03-2005/in_step_with_0 }}</ref>

His second chance as a TV series lead, the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Listen Up! (TV series)|Listen Up!]]'' (September 20, 2004 to April 25, 2005), also fell short of a second season. Alexander was also the principal [[executive producer]] of the series, based very loosely on the life of the popular sports-media personality [[Tony Kornheiser]]. Alexander appeared on the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' CD singing a verse in the song "All Cartoons are Fuckin' Dicks". He was featured in the ''[[Friends]]'' episode "[[The One Where Rosita Dies]]" as a suicidal supply manager named Earl. [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] calls him trying to sell him [[toner]] and she learns about his problem and tries to persuade him not to commit suicide. This is referred to in an episode of ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' where Alexander appears as a neurotic and critical loner called Leonard. He describes himself as free and mentions that he makes money with a job "selling toner over the phone". Also in the episode, he is repeatedly harassed by a man named George – his character's name on ''Seinfeld''. Alexander appeared in the 1995 TV version of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', as Conrad Birdie's agent, Albert Peterson. He guest-starred in episode 8 of the 1996 variety show ''[[Muppets Tonight]]''.

Alexander appeared on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' on the episode "[[Think Tank (Star Trek: Voyager)|Think Tank]]" playing a genius alien named Kurros who was trying to get [[Seven of Nine]] to serve on his ship. He appeared in "[[One Night at Mercy]]", the first episode of the short-lived [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002 revival of ''The Twilight Zone'']], playing [[Death (personification)|Death]]. He featured in the 2005 ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' episode "[[Mr. Monk and the Other Detective]]" as Monk's rival, Marty Eels. On the June 26, 2006 episode of the ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' talk show, Alexander demonstrated several self-defense techniques. He was also the Host of the 230th July 4, 2006 of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] July 4 "A Capitol Fourth" Celebrations in Washington, D.C. in which he sang, danced, and played tuned drums. In 2006, Alexander signed on to feature as a regular cast member in the second season of ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''. Alexander was the host of [[Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner|the Comedy Central Roast of actor William Shatner]] on August 13, 2006 (first airdate: August 20, 2006). In 2007, Alexander was a guest star in the third episode of the [[improv comedy]] series ''[[Thank God You're Here (US TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]''. He is also a frequent guest and panelist on: [[Bill Maher]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' and ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]]'' shows; ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; the ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|Late Late Show]]'', with both [[Craig Kilborn]] and [[Craig Ferguson]]; and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

In 2008, Alexander guest-starred on the [[CBS]] show ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' in the [[List of Criminal Minds episodes (season 4)|season four]] episode "Masterpiece" as Prof. Rothschild,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1256105/ |title="Criminal Minds" Masterpiece|date=2008|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/criminal-minds-2008/episode-8-season-4/masterpiece/192244 |title=Criminal Minds Episode Guide 2008 Season 4 – Masterpiece, Episode 8 |publisher=Tvguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref> a well-educated [[serial killer]] obsessed with the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] who sends the team into a race against time to save his last victims.

Compassion!]]'', ''[[Dunston Checks In]]'', ''[[Love and Action in Chicago (film)|Love and Action in Chicago]]'', ''[[The Last Supper (1995 film)|The Last Supper]]'' and psychological horror film ''[[Jacob's Ladder (film)|Jacob's Ladder]]''.

In January 1995, Alexander did a commercial for Rold Gold pretzels to be broadcast during the [[Super Bowl]]. The commercial depicts him with ''[[Frasier]]'' dog "Eddie" jumping out of an airplane with a parachute over the stadium. After the commercial, the audience is brought back to a supposedly "live feed" of the playing field hearing startled sports commentators as Alexander and the dog land in the field to wild applause. In the summer of 2005, he appeared with [[Lee Iacocca]] in ads for [[DaimlerChrysler]]. Lee Iacocca did the ads as part of a way to raise money for Dr. Denise Faustman's research to cure [[autoimmunity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faustmanlab.org |title=faustmanlab.org |publisher=faustmanlab.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> Both Lee Iacocca and Jason Alexander have had loved ones whose lives have been adversely affected by autoimmunity.

He has also appeared in [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] (KFC) commercials, including one with baseball superstar [[Barry Bonds]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] and another one opposite [[Trista Rehn]] of ''[[The Bachelorette]]''. It was rumored that he no longer appears in these commercials due to the alleged [[cruelty to animals]] by KFC suppliers and [[slaughterhouse]]s, but he refuted that in the August 2, 2006 issue of ''[[Adweek]]''. Alexander said, "That's [[PETA]] bullcrap. I loved working for KFC. I was targeted by PETA to broker something between them. I think KFC really stepped up to the plate; unfortunately PETA did not."

He performed a [[mentalism]] and magic act at [[the Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood, California]] from April 24 to 30, 2006. He has been awarded the Parlor Magician of the year award at the Castle.

In 2007, Alexander appeared in a commercial for the [[ASPCA]], which has aired on cable TV stations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDCP75iz22M | title = Logan, a victim of animal cruelty|publisher=Youtube.com | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}</ref> In 1987, Alexander appeared in a commercial for Miller Lite, with Yogi Berra as the celebrity, speaking about Miller Lite using his unique malapropism eloquence, sitting at a bar with many others including a young Jason Alexander standing behind Berra's left shoulder.
