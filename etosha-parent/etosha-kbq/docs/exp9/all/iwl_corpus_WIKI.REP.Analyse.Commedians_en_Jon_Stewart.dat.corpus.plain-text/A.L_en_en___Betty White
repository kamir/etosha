'''Betty White Ludden''' (born '''Betty Marion White'''; January 17, 1922), known professionally as '''Betty White''', is an American actress, comedienne, author, producer, radio host, singer, and television personality. In 2013, the [[Guinness World Records]] awarded White with having the longest television career for a female entertainer.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dawn|first=Randee|title=Betty White, 'Breaking Bad' earn 'Guinness World Records' titles|url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/betty-white-breaking-bad-earn-guinness-world-records-titles-8C11089734|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Today.com]]|date=September 6, 2013}}</ref> To contemporary audiences, White is best known for her roles as [[Sue Ann Nivens]] on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' (1973–77) and [[Rose Nylund]] on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' (1985–92).

Since 2010 she has starred as [[Elka Ostrovsky]] in the [[TV Land]] sitcom ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', for which she has won two consecutive [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s, presented the practical-joke show ''[[Betty White's Off Their Rockers]]'', which resulted in three consecutive Emmy nominations and became the oldest person to [[Saturday Night Live hosts#Oldest hosts|guest-host]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a performance which was  a major ratings success and earned her a Primetime Emmy award.

With 18 Emmy acting nominations, White is second only to [[Cloris Leachman]] as the most nominated actress in the award's history. She is also the only woman to have received an Emmy in all performing comedic categories and also holds the record for longest span between Emmy nominations for performances—her first was in 1951 and her most recent was in 2011, a span of 60 years. She is also the oldest winner of a competitive [[Grammy Award]] and the oldest nominee of a performing Emmy. A staple guest of many American game shows such as ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Match Game]]'' and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $25,000 Pyramid]]'',  White has been dubbed the 'First Lady of Game Shows' and became the first woman to receive an Emmy Award for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] in 1983 for the show ''[[Just Men!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stacy Conradt, Mental Floss |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/worklife/02/23/mf.betty.white.why.love/ |title=10 reasons we love Betty White - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

White has also been formally inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame and has received the [[Disney Legends]] award.

White is also known for her animal welfare work. She has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the [[Los Angeles Zoo]] and has been a member of the board of directors since 1974.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/30-fun-facts-birthday-girl-betty-white-152000903.html |title=30 Fun Facts About Birthday Girl Betty White! - Yahoo TV |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

But White did not start off as television royalty.<ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/>

==Career==

===1939–73: Radio career, ''Life With Elizabeth'' and television pioneer===
White made rounds to movie studios looking for work, but was always turned down because she was "unphotogenic". So then she started to look for radio jobs where being "photogenic" did not matter. Her first radio jobs included reading commercials and playing bit parts, and sometimes even doing crowd noises. She made about five dollars a show. She would do just about anything, like singing on a show for no money, or making an appearance on the local game show.<ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/> White began her television career in 1939, three months after high school graduation, when she and a classmate sang songs from ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' on an [[History of television#United States|experimental Los Angeles channel]].<ref>{{cite news|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|title=Cool Betty White is red-hot|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/02/09/betty.white.super.bowl/index.html?hpt=C2|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=February 9, 2010|quote=According to an oral history interview White conducted in 1994 for the Archive of American Television, she broke into the business three months after graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1938 at an early age, as part of an experimental television show.}}</ref>{{r|aatinterview}}<ref name="oneil20100617">{{cite news|last=O'neil|first=Tom|title=Betty White reflects on a golden career|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/06/betty-white-reflects-on-a-golden-career-.html|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 17, 2010}}</ref> White found work modeling, and her first professional acting job was at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre. White's career was disrupted immediately, as World War II broke out, causing her to join the [[American Women's Voluntary Services]]. In the 1940s, she worked in radio, appearing on shows such as ''[[Blondie (radio)|Blondie]]'', ''[[The Great Gildersleeve]]'', and ''[[This is Your FBI]]''. She then got her own radio show, called ''The Betty White Show''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Betty White honored with 2009 Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award|url=http://www.sagawards.org/media-pr/press-releases/betty-white-honored-2009-screen-actors-guild-lifetime-achievement-award|accessdate=October 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]|date=January 23, 2010|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>

In 1949, she began appearing as co-host with Al Jarvis on his daily [[live television]] variety show ''Hollywood on Television'', originally called ''Al Jarvis' Make-Believe Ballroom'' on [[KFWB|KFWB radio]] and on [[KCOP-TV|KLAC-TV]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|title=Betty White to receive SAG lifetime award |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/286269 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=|date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref><ref name="oneil20100617"/> White began hosting the show by herself in 1952 after Jarvis' departure,<ref name=thr/> spanning five and a half hours of live [[ad-lib]] television six days per week over a contiguous four-year span altogether.  In all of her various variety series over the years, White would sing at least a couple of songs during each broadcast. In 1950, Betty was nominated for her first [[Emmy Award]] as "Best Actress" on television, competing with such legendary stars as [[Judith Anderson]], [[Helen Hayes]], and [[Imogene Coca]] (the award went to [[Gertrude Berg]]).  This was the very first award and category in the new Emmy history designated for women on television. In 1951 White won her first Emmy for most outstanding female personality, a Los Angeles regional award.<ref>http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/package/article/0,,20840501_20846506,00.html</ref>

In 1952, the same year she began hosting ''Hollywood on Television'', White co-founded Bandy Productions with writer [[George Tibbles]] and [[Don Fedderson]], a producer.<ref name=thr/> The trio worked to create new shows using existing characters from sketches shown on ''Hollywood on Television''. White, Fedderson, and Tibbles created the [[television comedy]] ''[[Life with Elizabeth]]'', based on a ''Hollywood on Television'' sketch.<ref name=thr/> White portrayed the [[title character]] on the sitcom from 1952 to 1955, which effectively boosted her career.<ref name=thr/> ''Life With Elizabeth'' was nationally [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] by the mid-1950s, allowing White to become one of the few women in television with full creative control in front of and behind the camera at the time.<ref name=thr/> Although several sources state White won an Emmy for the show<ref name=thr/><ref name=shemadeit/><ref name="oneil20100617"/><ref name=museum>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/whitebetty/whitebetty.htm |title=WHITE, BETTY – The Museum of Broadcast Communications |publisher=Museum.tv |date=January 17, 1922 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> this appears to be incorrect,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924508/awards Awards for Betty White]</ref> and may be a matter of confusing the 1950 nomination with a win. The show was unusual for a sitcom in the 1950s because it was co-produced and owned by a twenty-eight-year-old woman who still lived with her parents. White said they didn't worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real life situations that happened to her, the actor who played Alvin, and the writer.<ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/>

[[File:Betty White in The Betty White Show 1954 (2).jpg|thumb|White in ''The Betty White Show'' (1954)]]
In 1954, she briefly hosted and produced her own daily talk show, ''The Betty White Show'', on [[NBC]] (not to be confused with her 1970s sitcom of the same name).<ref name=thr/> Following ''Life with Elizabeth'', she appeared as Vicki Angel on the sitcom ''[[Date with the Angels]]'' from 1957 to 1958. The show later became another variety series before going off the air.<ref name=thr/> White performed in [[commercials]] seen on live television in Los Angeles, including a spirited rendition of the "Dr. Ross Dog Food" advertisement at [[KTLA]] during the 1950s.

She made her feature film debut as Kansas Senator Elizabeth Ames Adams in the 1962 drama, ''[[Advise & Consent (film)|Advise & Consent]]''. Despite her performance being well received, it would be her only big-screen appearance for decades.

Betty White's greatest fame during the 1960s and early 1970s with the general public was likely from her long stint as hostess and commentator on the annual [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] broadcast on NBC, often co-hosting with [[Lorne Greene]].  White began a nineteen-year run as host on the program in 1956; NBC replaced her in 1975, feeling she was too identified with rival network CBS due to her new found success on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.  White admitted to [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] it was difficult "watching someone else do my parade",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Windeler|first=Robert|title=MTM Is Ending and Stumpers Is Dumped, but Betty White & Allen Ludden Still Have Each Other|journal=People|date=December 20, 1976|volume=6|issue=25|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067239,00.html|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> although she soon would start a ten-year run as hostess of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] for CBS.

White would receive her second and third Emmys from her part on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. White considers her part as Sue Ann in the show one of the highlights of her professional career, but she describes her television image as "icky sweet." She felt that she was the very definition of feminine passivity, owing to the fact that White always seemed willing to satirize her own unique persona on screen in just such a way.<ref name="O'Dell, C. 1997"/>

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, White appeared on a number of late night talk shows and daytime game shows, including ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''.<ref name=thr/> White made many appearances on the hit game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' as a celebrity guest from 1961 through 1975. She married the show's host, [[Allen Ludden]], in 1963.<ref name=thr/> She subsequently appeared on the show's three updated versions ''Password Plus'', ''Super Password'', and ''Million Dollar Password'', having been on versions of the game with five different hosts (Allen Ludden, [[Bill Cullen]], [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]], [[Bert Convy]], and [[Regis Philbin]]). White made frequent game show appearances on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' (starting in 1955), ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' (in 1961 and in 1990), ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' (in 1972–73), ''Match Game'' (1973–1982), and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' (starting in 1982). Both ''Password'' and ''Pyramid'' were created by White's friend, [[Bob Stewart (television producer)|Bob Stewart]].

===1973–85: Continued success, comedic endeavors and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show''===
In 1973, White made a [[guest appearance]] in season four of  ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' as ''The Happy Homemaker''.<ref name=thr/> As a result of her guest appearance, White landed her most significant role at that point as the sardonic, man-hungry [[Sue Ann Nivens]], ''The Happy Homemaker'', on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' as a full-time cast member.<ref name=thr/> The [[running gag]] was that Sue Ann's hard-edged private personality was the complete opposite of how she presented herself on her show. "We need somebody who can play sickeningly sweet, like Betty White," Moore herself suggested at a production meeting, which resulted in casting White herself. White won two back-to-back Emmy Awards for her role in the hugely popular series.<ref name=thr/>

Following that show's end in 1977, she was given her own sitcom on CBS, her second series entitled ''[[The Betty White Show]]''<ref name=thr/> (the first having been broadcast a quarter century earlier), during the 1977–78 season, in which she co-starred with [[John Hillerman]] and former ''Mary Tyler Moore'' co-star [[Georgia Engel]]. It was canceled after one season.  White appeared several times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' appearing in many sketches, and began guest-starring in a number of television movies and television miniseries, including ''[[With This Ring]]'', ''The Best Place to Be'', ''Before and After'', and ''The Gossip Columnist''.<ref name=thr/>

In 1983, she became the first woman to win a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in the category of Outstanding Game Show Host, for the NBC entry ''Just Men!''.<ref name=VanityFair>"It's Evening in America". ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. May 2012. Page 157.</ref> Due to the amount of work she has done on them, she has been deemed the "First Lady of Game Shows".<ref>{{cite news|last=Conradt|first=Stacy|title=10 reasons we love Betty White|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/worklife/02/23/mf.betty.white.why.love/|accessdate=October 25, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=February 23, 2010}}</ref>

From 1983 through 1985, she had a recurring role playing [[Ellen Harper|Ellen Harper Jackson]] on the series ''[[Mama's Family]]'',<ref name=thr/> along with future ''Golden Girls'' co-star Rue McClanahan. White had originated this character in a series of sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in the 1970s. When ''Mama's Family'' was picked up in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] after being canceled by NBC in 1985, White left the show (with the exception of one final appearance in the show's [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version in 1986).

===1985–2000: ''The Golden Girls'' and new career heights===
[[File:Betty White 1989 Emmy Awards.jpg|180px|thumb|left|White at the 1989 Emmy Awards]]

In 1985, she scored her second signature role and the biggest hit of her career as the [[Rose Nylund#St. Olaf|St. Olaf, Minnesota]]-native [[Rose Nylund]] on ''The Golden Girls''.<ref name=thr/> The series chronicled the lives of four widowed or divorced women in their "golden years" who shared a home in Miami. ''The Golden Girls'', which also starred [[Bea Arthur]], [[Estelle Getty]], and [[Rue McClanahan]], was immensely successful and ran from 1985 through 1992. White won one Emmy Award, for ''Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series'', for the first season of ''The Golden Girls''<ref name=thr/> and was nominated in that category every year of the show's run (the only cast member to receive that distinction – Getty was also nominated every year, but in the supporting actress category). When Beatrice Arthur left in 1992, White, McClanahan, and Getty reprised their roles Rose, Blanche, and Sophia in the spin-off ''[[The Golden Palace]]''.<ref name=thr/> The series was short-lived, lasting only one season.  In addition, White reprised her Rose Nylund character in guest appearances on the NBC shows ''[[Empty Nest]]'' and ''[[Nurses (TV series)|Nurses]]'', both of which were set in Miami.<ref name=thr/>

[[File:Betty White 1988 Emmy Awards 2.jpg|thumb|right|White at the 1988 Emmy Awards]]

White was originally offered the role of Blanche in ''The Golden Girls,'' and Rue McClanahan was offered the role of Rose (the two characters being similar to roles they had played in ''Mary Tyler Moore'' and ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', respectively).  [[Jay Sandrich]], the director of the pilot, suggested that since they had played similar roles in the past, they should switch roles, Rue McClanahan later said in a documentary on the series. White was originally afraid to play Rose, feeling that she would not be able to play the role – until the show's creator took her aside and told her not to play Rose as stupid but to play her as someone "terminally naive, a person who always believed the first explanation of something."

In September 2009, the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) announced plans to honor White with the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award at the [[16th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. [[Sandra Bullock]] presented White with the award on January 23, 2010, at the ceremony, which took place at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=thr/> She is a [[Kentucky Colonel]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Huriash|first=Lisa J.|title=Mayor becomes 'Kentucky Colonel'|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-02-07/news/fl-mayor-kentucky-20100207_1_kentucky-colonel-jack-brady-kentucky-connection|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date=February 7, 2010}}</ref> In 2009, White and her now-deceased ''Golden Girls'' cast mates [[Bea Arthur]], [[Rue McClanahan]], and [[Estelle Getty]] were awarded honorary [[Disney Legend]] awards. Betty was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in December 2010. In 2010 she was chosen as the [[Associated Press]]'s Entertainer of the Year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coyle|first=Jake|title=Betty White Voted AP Entertainer of the Year|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/20/betty-white-voted-ap-entertainer-of-the-year_n_799015.html|accessdate=October 25, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 20, 2010|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

On November 9, 2010, the USDA Forest Service, along with [[Smokey Bear]], made actress Betty White an honorary forest ranger, fulfilling her lifelong dream.<ref>{{cite news|title=Forest Service makes actress Betty White honorary ranger|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/news/2010/releases/11/betty-white.shtml|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=[[United States Forest Service]]|date=November 9, 2010}}</ref> White said in previous interviews that she wanted to be a forest ranger as a little girl but that women were not allowed to do that then. Today's [[United States Forest Service]] is 38 percent female, including rangers, scientists, and leaders at every level.

In January 2011, White received a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her role as [[Elka Ostrovsky]] in ''Hot in Cleveland''. The show itself was also nominated for an award as Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, but lost to the cast of ''[[Modern Family]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 17th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards|url=http://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/17th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards|work=[[Screen Actors Guild Award]]|publisher=SAG-AFTRA|accessdate=January 18, 2014|year=2011}}</ref> She won the same award again in 2012, and has received a third nomination.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title=Betty White Nominated for Third Consecutive Screen Actors Guild Award for TV Land's 'Hot in Cleveland'|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/12/12/betty-white-nominated-for-third-consecutive-screen-actors-guild-award-for-tv-lands-hot-in-cleveland/161592/|accessdate=January 18, 2014|newspaper=TV by the Numbers|date=December 12, 2012}}</ref>

A 2011 poll conducted by [[Reuters]] and [[Ipsos]] revealed that White was considered to be the most popular and most trusted celebrity among Americans, beating out the likes of [[Denzel Washington]], [[Sandra Bullock]], and [[Tom Hanks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=America loves Betty White best|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 19, 2011|date= August 19, 2011|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/19/america-loves-betty-white-best/}}</ref>

In October 2011, White was awarded an honorary degree and white doctors coat by [[Washington State University]] at the Washington State Veterinary Medical Association's centennial gala in [[Yakima, Washington]].

In 2012, White won her first Grammy, aged 90 for the audio version of her best-selling book.
