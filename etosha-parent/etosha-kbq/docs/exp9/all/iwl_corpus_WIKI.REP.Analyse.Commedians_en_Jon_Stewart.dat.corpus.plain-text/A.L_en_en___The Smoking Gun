'''The Smoking Gun''' is a [[website]] that posts legal documents, arrest records, and police [[mugshot]]s on a daily basis. The intent is to bring to the public light information that is damning, shocking, outrageous, or amazing, yet also somewhat obscure or unreported by more mainstream media sources. Most of the site's content revolves around historical and current events, although it also features documents and photos relating to out-of-the-ordinary crimes and people.

The name refers to the [[smoking gun]] [[metaphor]], which is commonly used to describe an incriminating piece of [[evidence (law)|evidence]].

==History==
The [[website]] was founded in 1997 by [[William Bastone]] and [[Daniel Green (reporter)|Daniel Green]], former [[reporter]]s for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and graphic designer Barbara Glauber. Most of The Smoking Gun's content is obtained through [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests to federal, state, and local [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], and from [[public record]]s such as court documents. The site has used those requests to assemble a collection of mugshots of current and historical celebrities.

The cable network [[truTV]], formerly [[Court TV]] purchased The Smoking Gun, as well as the website [[Crime Library]], in 2000.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} A series of the same name premiered on Court TV in 2005. The series features some of the site's stories and assorted sketch humor using string puppets. This series was later moved and shown on [[Adult Swim]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} From March 2008 until January 2011 on truTV, The Smoking Gun sponsored a cable television series called ''[[truTV Presents: World's Dumbest...|The Smoking Gun Presents: World's Dumbest...]]''. The series was originally known as ''World's Dumbest Criminals'', but was retitled ''World's Dumbest...'' and began covering other topics. As of January 2011, the program was retitled again to ''[[truTV Presents: World's Dumbest...]]'' On June 2014, The Smoking Gun was sold back to William Bastone. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/the-smoking-gun-sale-876401|title=Meet The New Boss, Same As The Old Boss: A Note From TSG World Headquarters|work=The Smoking Gun}}</ref>

The site published its second book, ''The Dog Dialed 911: A Book of Lists from The Smoking Gun'', in October 2006.

== Investigations ==
The Smoking Gun has begun to organize in-depth investigations of criminal activity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2009/08/the-smoking-gun-exposes-pranknet-as-internet-badboys-cower.ars |title=The Smoking Gun exposes PrankNet as Internet badboys cower |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=August 7, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In August 2009, the site outed members of [[Pranknet]], a [[virtual community]] notorious for tricking hotel and fast-food restaurant employees into setting off [[fire alarm]]s, engaging fire-suppression systems, and engaging in humiliating acts such as disrobing and consuming urine. The group, whose members include two convicted [[child molestor]]s,<ref>{{cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0806091markle1.html |title=Another Pranknet Child Molester |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktre.com/Global/story.asp?S=10869089&nav=menu118_11_6 |title=Diboll woman says allegations against Markle are not shocking |publisher=KTRE.com |date=August 8, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> also engaged in threatening telephone harassment by placing fake [[Craigslist]] ads and shouting racial epithets and obscenities at people responding to them. They also responded to Craigslist ads placed by young mothers selling household goods, and once they had the seller's address said that they were on their way over to rape them and murder their children.<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0803091pranknet1.html Telephone Terrorist] The Smoking Gun, August 3, 2009</ref>

In 2006 the site uncovered widespread fabrication in [[James Frey|James Frey's]] alleged memoir ''[[A Million Little Pieces]].''  This investigation led to a very public rebuke of Frey by [[Oprah Winfrey]] who had previously endorsed Frey's book as part of her [[Oprah's Book Club]].  Frey's book, describing his alleged years of drug and alcohol abuse and subsequent recovery, contained a number of descriptions of criminal or otherwise outrageous incidents.<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies A Million Little Lies] The Smoking Gun, January 4, 2006</ref>
