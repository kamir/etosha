'''''The Larry Sanders Show''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] set in the office and studio of a fictional [[late-night talk show]]. The show was created by [[Garry Shandling]] and Dennis Klein and aired from August 1992 to May 1998 on the [[HBO]] cable television network. The series stars Shandling, [[Jeffrey Tambor]], and [[Rip Torn]] and features celebrities playing exaggerated, self-parodying versions of themselves. The show has its roots in Shandling's [[stand-up comedy]] background, his experience as a [[guest host]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' and his earlier sitcom ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]''. The program has had a marked and long-lasting influence on HBO as well as on television shows in America and Britain such as ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.  The supporting cast includes [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Kathryn Harrold]], [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]] and [[Jeremy Piven]].

The series ranked 38 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]], the only HBO comedy to make the list,<ref name = "tvguide"/> and was also included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the "100 Best TV Shows of All Time."<ref name = "time100">{{cite news| last = Poniewozik| first = James| url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/completelist/0,,1651341,00.html| title = The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]| accessdate = December 4, 2010| authorlink = James Poniewozik| date=September 6, 2007}}</ref>

The show won 24 major awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards, five CableACE Awards, four American Comedy Awards, two British Comedy Awards, two [[Peabody Awards]], a BAFTA Award and a Satellite Award. It also received 86 nominations, including 56 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, five Directors Guild of America nominations, six Writers' Guild of America nominations, six American Comedy Awards nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, three Satellite Awards nominations and a [[GLAAD Award]] nomination.<ref name = "imdbawards">

==Premise==

===Origins===
From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, there was a stream of American stand-up comedians finding success in comedy sitcoms on broadcast network television, including [[Bill Cosby]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Paul Reiser]], [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[Brett Butler (actress)|Brett Butler]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], and [[Drew Carey]]. [[Garry Shandling]] took a slightly different path with the cable network sitcoms ''The Larry Sanders Show'' and its forerunner ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]''.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/>

In ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'', Shandling makes use of the [[George Burns]] technique of [[Fourth wall|directly addressing]] the audience. He speaks to the studio and home audiences as well as the other actors, often in quick succession.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/><ref name=latimes>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/20/entertainment/et-shandling20|title=Dollying through that fourth wall on 'It's Garry Shandling's Show'|accessdate=15 April 2013 | work=Los Angeles Times|first=Robert|last=Lloyd|date=20 October 2009}}</ref> In both shows celebrity guests appear as themselves and Shandling essentially plays himself: a star of a television show and stand-up comedian with a distinctive "comic persona and rhythm".<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/> Shandling said, in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "the idea for doing something about a talk show host actually came out of an ''It’s Garry Shandling’s Show'' episode in which I was the guest on an LA morning show... I thought I could make the talk show look very real so the audience would buy that part and then slowly suck them into the realities of life once Larry goes behind the curtain."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/10/12/reunions-2012-garry-shandling-larry-sanders-show/|title='Larry Sanders' cast reunion: Garry Shandling on his groundbreaking comedy series -- VIDEO|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>

In 1981, Shandling performed a stand-up routine on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' and subsequently became a regular guest, particularly at short notice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20094137,00.html|title=Johnny Carson and Joan Rivers Can Agree on One Thing: Garry Shandling Is Perfect for Her Old Tonight Show Job|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> He also began appearing as a [[guest host]] and, in 1986, replaced [[Joan Rivers]] as "permanent guest host". He was considered to be a possible, although unlikely, successor to [[Johnny Carson]]. After [[Jay Leno]] replaced Carson in 1992, Shandling was offered his own late-night (1 a.m.) talk show but preferred instead to create "a show about a talk-show", ''The Larry Sanders Show.''<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/><ref name="Sweeney2006">{{cite book|author=Don Sweeney|title=Backstage at the Tonight Show: From Johnny Carson to Jay Leno|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AfYJIdSL-jwC&pg=PA142|accessdate=13 April 2013|date=27 April 2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=978-1-58979-637-9|pages=142–}}</ref> The series has similarities to ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'', ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]'' and classic Hollywood [[Backstage musical|back-stage musicals]] with their "let's put on a show" attitude, but the links to ''The Tonight Show'' are so strong it verges on parody.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/>

===Plot===
The show revolves around the production of a fictional [[late night talk show]], also called ''The Larry Sanders Show''. It chronicles the daily life of Larry (Garry Shandling) the host, Arthur "Artie" ([[Rip Torn]]) his [[Television producer|producer]], Hank Kingsley ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) Larry's sidekick, the production staff and their interaction with celebrity guests, the network and everything in between. Episodes focus on the professional and personal lives of the principal characters, with most focusing on Larry. Ancillary characters are also prominently featured, among them the writers Phil and Jerry, talent bookers Paula and Mary Lou, and the personal assistants Beverly, Darlene and Brian. Larry's wife, ex-wife and girlfriends are frequent sources of conflict, and his home is a secondary location for the show.

A typical early episode opens to the titles with the sound of Hank's audience [[Warm-up comedian|warm-up routine]] in the background. This is followed by the talk show's titles and an excerpt from Larry's monologue. Episodes vary after this, sometimes continuing with the studio recording, but often cutting to a back-stage shot or to the production offices.

===Different kind of sitcom===
''The Larry Sanders Show'' is a [[satire]] on show business that subtly mixes fact with fiction. It featured real-life celebrity guests as they performed on the talk show and as they appeared behind the scenes.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/> For example, in the final episode Larry interviews [[Sean Penn]] who, once they cut to a commercial break, gossips freely about Shandling's acting, insecurity, and behaviour towards Penn's wife ([[Robin Wright]]) on the set of ''[[Hurlyburly (film)|Hurlyburly]]'', in which all three appear.<ref name="nytimes2">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/31/magazine/garry-shandling-goes-dark.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Garry Shandling Goes Dark|accessdate=9 March 2013 | work=The New York Times|first=Lynn|last=Hirschberg|date=31 May 1998}}</ref> The sharply written scripts often shocked by appearing to show the guest's malice, or the difference between their public and private personas.<ref name=telegraph2>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8029998/Larry-Sanders-the-greatest-TV-show-ever.html|title=Larry Sanders: the greatest TV show ever?|accessdate=30 April 2013 | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>

Profanities were used frequently on the show, although not gratuitously, with the writers taking advantage of the freedom allowed by HBO as a subscription cable service. It paved the way for subsequent HBO shows such as ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/> According to [[Peter Tolan]], early episodes were also recorded with language suitable for [[broadcast syndication]] until mid-way through the second season, when the actors resisted shooting the extra takes.<ref name=latimes2>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/26/entertainment/ca-53429/2| title=The Last Word From 'Larry'| accessdate=28 May 2013 | work=Los Angeles Times| first=Paul| last=Brownfield| date=26 May 1998}}</ref>

The show used both [[videotape]] and film. The behind the scenes footage was shot on film, often using [[hand-held camera]]s, in a documentary style that adds to the impression of privileged back-stage access. Four video cameras recorded the [[show-within-a-show]] which gives a brighter, less grainy picture<ref name=guardian2>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/mar/30/larry-sanders-show-dvd|title=The Larry Sanders Show: the king of chat returns|accessdate=29 April 2013 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=David|last=Stubbs|date=30 March 2011}}</ref> and helps distinguish the talk show from the back-stage scenes.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/>

The talk show was carefully staged with realistic music, lighting and set design. It was recorded in front of an actual live studio audience during the first season and then occasionally during later episodes.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008">{{cite book|author1=Gary Richard Edgerton|author2=Jeffrey P. Jones|author3=George Plasketes|title=The Essential HBO Reader|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=odSAPSA1JFEC&pg=PA183|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2008|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2452-0|pages=183–192}}</ref>

===Catchphrases===
The show had several catchphrases used throughout its entire run. The most common was "Hey now", a phrase Hank repeats in the opening credits of the fictional talk show and whenever he greets someone. It mirrors the "Hi-yo" catchphrase used by [[Ed McMahon]] (sidekick on ''The Tonight Show''), upon whom Hank Kingsley was based.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/> In one episode, Hank says he invented the phrase when he accidentally said it to someone and liked it. In 2007, TV Land ranked "Hey Now" as the 87th Best Television catchphrase. "No flipping" is a phrase Larry uses to go to commercial breaks, encouraging the at-home audience not to change to another channel. In the series finale, the last thing Larry says on his talk show is, "You may now flip".

[[Jeremy Piven]] grew tired of playing the character Jerry, head writer of the fictional talk show, because his character was not given much of a background. He was written out during the episode "Larry's Birthday", where Artie fired Jerry because of his behavior. Eventually, [[Wallace Langham]] (Phil) replaced him as the talk show's head writer.
Some popular episodes of the season were: "Larry's Agent", in which Larry tries to fire his agent; "Broadcast Nudes", in which Hank wants Darlene ([[Linda Doucett]]) to pose nude in ''Playboy'' magazine (Doucett actually appeared in the September 1993 edition of the magazine<ref name=people1>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20106022,00.html|title=Cleared for Takeoff|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref>); "Larry's Birthday" in which Larry doesn't want anyone throwing a party for his birthday;  "The Grand Opening", in which Hank tries to promote his new restaurant; "Off Camera", in which Artie has to deal with all the stress that Larry suffers every show; and the season finale "L.A or N.Y?", in which Larry leaves the talk show and moves to Montana, to protest the network's desire to shift the talk show's base from L.A. to New York.

The show was nominated for four Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to ''[[Frasier]]'' and would continue doing so for the rest of its run. Rip Torn was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy.

Linda Doucett (Darlene) left the show at the end of season three. She had been in a six-year relationship with Shandling, but the couple became estranged between seasons and she was written out of the show. Doucett filed a lawsuit against Shandling and producer [[Brad Grey]]'s company for [[sexual harassment]] and [[wrongful termination]], which was settled out of court for $1 million.<ref name=times>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/movies/13holl.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=David M. | last1=Halbfinger | title=A Studio Boss and a Private Eye Star in a Bitter Hollywood Tale | date=March 13, 2006}}</ref> She was replaced as Hank's assistant by [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]] (Brian).

===Season 5===
The season premiered November 13, 1996 and ended on February 26, 1997.

Janeane Garofalo decided to leave due to decreasing screen time for her character Paula, the talk show's talent booker. [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] (Mary Lou, Paula's assistant) replaced her as booker. [[Jon Stewart]] became a frequent guest who threatened to replace Larry on the talk show.

Some of the most famous episodes of the series were made in this season: "Everybody Loves Larry", in which Larry starts suspecting that [[David Duchovny]] has sexual feelings for him;<ref name="Mink">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/sanders-art-real-article-1.741623|title='SANDERS' AND THE ART OF THE REAL|accessdate=21 January 2013|last=Mink|first=Eric|work=The New York Daily News|date=November 12, 1996}}</ref> "My Name is Asher Kingsley", in which Hank explores his Jewish roots; "Ellen, or Isn't She?", in which Larry and Artie try to find if [[Ellen DeGeneres]] is really a lesbian; "The New Writer", in which Wendy ([[Sarah Silverman]]) begins working as a writer, much to Phil's dismay; "The Book", in which Larry [[#Books|writes an autobiography]]; "Pain Equals Funny", in which Paula leaves the show; and the season finale, "Larry's New Love", in which Hank is afraid the network is trying to replace him.

The show was nominated for 16 Emmy awards, breaking the record for most nominations for a Comedy Series for an individual Emmy year. The record was maintained for ten years, until [[30 Rock]] received 17 nominations. The show was nominated for the fifth time for Outstanding Comedy Series, and was considered a front-runner for the award, but was defeated again by ''Frasier.'' Shandling was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Torn and Tambor were nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Janeane Garofalo was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. It received two nominations for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series: one for Todd Holland for "Everybody Loves Larry", another for Alan Myerson for "Ellen, Or Isn't She?" It received three nominations for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series: one for Shandling, John Markus and [[Judd Apatow]] for the episode "Ellen, Or Isn't She?", another for Peter Tolan for "My Name is Asher Kingsley", and another for Jon Vitti for "Everybody Loves Larry". David Duchovny and Ellen DeGeneres received nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor and Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. The show was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Series-Musical or Comedy. It received two Directors Guild of America Award nominations; one for Holland for "Everybody Loves Larry", another for Alan Myerson for "Ellen, Or Isn't She?" It was also nominated for two Writers' Guild of America Awards: one for Maya Forbes for "The Book" and another for Shandling, John Markus and Judd Apatow for "Ellen, Or Isn't She?"

===Season 6===
The season premiered on March 15, 1998 and ended on May 31, 1998. Shandling decided to make this the final season in part because of his high workload on the show.<ref name=nytimes3/> The main story arc is the increasing pressure from the network to aim for a younger audience that results in Larry deciding to leave the talk show.<ref name=latimes2/>

Most of the changes to the show occurred offscreen this season. All of the show's writers left except Shandling, Tolan, and Apatow, and a new writing staff was hired. Shandling's relationship with his manager, Brad Grey, had broken down and in January 1998, Shandling filed a lawsuit for $100 million against Grey.<ref name=nytimes2/> In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Shandling said "We had a situation in which the writers were leaving the show for other Brillstein-Grey shows, which became part of the issue of a lawsuit".<ref name=nytimes3>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/arts/television/31sanders.html?_r=0|title=Garry and Larry and Jeffrey and Hank|accessdate=13 March 2013 | work=The New York Times|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=29 October 2010}}</ref> (The suit was settled out of court for $10 million.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/17/entertainment/et-pellicanonotes17|title=What's next after Shandling shocker?|accessdate=13 March 2013 | work=Los Angeles Times|first=Rachel|last=Abramowitz|date=17 March 2008}}</ref>) Todd Holland, who directed more than 48 episodes of the show, only directed two of the sixth season. This season was also markedly less comedic than earlier ones. Sid, the cue card guy at the talk show, commits suicide in the episode "I Buried Sid".

Some of the most popular episodes of the season were: "Another List", in which the network threatens to replace Larry with Jon Stewart unless he makes some changes; "The Beginning of the End", in which the talk show gets a new creative consultant who wants to make big changes; "Adolf Hankler", in which Hank has to play [[Adolf Hitler]], while Larry is on vacation and Jon Stewart guest hosts; "Beverly's Secret", in which Beverly ([[Penny Johnson Jerald|Penny Johnson]]) tries to tell the father that she's pregnant; "Putting the 'Gay' Back in Litigation", in which Brian sues Phil and the talk show for sexual harassment; and the series finale "Flip", in which the cast gets ready for their final broadcast and Larry and Artie deal with Hank and the emotions of the crew.

The finale was written by Shandling and Tolan. It was directed by Holland with a running time of 53 minutes. It aired on May 31, 16 days after the finale of ''Seinfeld'', and was watched by 2.5 million viewers, which was a significant number for HBO. The finale got very positive reviews from critics, especially in comparison to ''Seinfeld'''s series finale. Coincidentally, [[Jerry Seinfeld]] appears as himself in the ''Larry Sanders'' finale.

For its final Emmy year, it received 10 nominations and won two awards. Both wins were for the finale: Holland for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series; Shandling and Tolan for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series. It received its sixth nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost once again to ''Frasier'', for the fifth year in a row. Shandling was nominated Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Torn and Tambor were nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Richard Day, Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck were nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for "Putting the 'Gay' Back in Litigation." It received only one nomination for Directors Guild of America Award: Holland for the episode "Flip."

In a commentary on the season one DVD, Shandling says the guests were invariably happy to parody their media images and generally shared the same sense of humor as himself and the other writers.<ref name = "dvd1">

==Crew==

===Directors===
The show had a total of thirteen directors. [[Ken Kwapis]] directed most of the first season, including the pilot, and contributed to the visual style of the show. (He later went on to direct episodes of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', also including the pilot, using a "[[mockumentary]]" approach.)<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/> Todd Holland directed 51 episodes spanning all six seasons. Shandling directed three episodes of the final season.<ref name = "imdbcrew"/> Acting coach [[Roy London]] directed two episodes and received a "Special Thanks" credit at the end of every episode for his influence on the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117926877/|title=Special Thanks To Roy London|accessdate=27 February 2013 | work=Variety}}</ref> The show received one Emmy Award for directing. It went to Holland for the series finale "Flip".<ref name = "imdbawards"/>

===Writers===
More than 40 writers wrote episodes of the show. Shandling and Tolan were the head writers for the entire six-season run. Shandling and Dennis Klein wrote the pilot episode of the show. Shandling wrote 38, while Tolan wrote 23 episodes.<ref name = "imdbcrew"/> Shandling and Tolan received an Emmy Award for writing the series finale "Flip".<ref name = "imdbawards"/> Other writers on the show were Maya Forbes, Paul Simms, Judd Apatow, John Markus, John Riggi, [[Jon Vitti]], [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]], Drake Sather, [[Molly Newman]], [[Lester Lewis]], [[Becky Hartman Edwards]] and [[Jeff Cesario]].<ref name = "imdbcrew"/>

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
After the show ended, the ''[[New York Post]]'' called it "One of the Greatest Achievements in Television". ''[[LA Weekly]]'' called it "Very Funny". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said it was "The Closest Sitcom Ever Came to Perfect Pitch". ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the show "Brutally and Blatantly Hilarious" and ''[[USA Today]]'' gave it four stars.

Many critics called it one of the greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=latimes/><ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/dvd-reviews/8410940/The-Larry-Sanders-Show-DVD-review.html|title=The Larry Sanders Show, DVD review|accessdate=27 March 2013 | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Mark|last=Monahan|date=28 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=rolling/> Metacritic gives the show a metascore of 96%, based on 8 reviews. Doug Elfman from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said "It is simply the one of the best sitcoms ever". Ivan Morales calls it "the greatest HBO sitcom of all time". Brooke Allen in the ''New York Times'' called it "a comedy series so funny and risque as to make ''Seinfeld'' look positively bland".<ref name=nytimes4>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/24/bib/990124.rv041526.html|title=CONFESSIONS OF A LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST|accessdate=19 March 2013 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> Mark Monahan in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' called it "very close indeed to comic perfection."<ref name=telegraph/>

===Influence===
Despite drawing small audiences, ''The Larry Sanders Show'' has been hugely influential.<ref name=timeout1>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/film/not-just-the-best-of-the-larry-sanders-show|title=Not Just the Best of The Larry Sanders Show|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> It was largely responsible for establishing HBO's reputation as a supplier of quality shows which helped ''[[Sex and the City]]'', ''The Sopranos'', ''[[The Wire]]'' and ''Deadwood''.<ref name=guardian1>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/19/larry-sanders-show-box-set|title=Your next box set: The Larry Sanders Show|accessdate=25 April 2013 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Andrew|last=Pulver|date=19 March 2010}}</ref> The show left its mark on many subsequent series with satirical back-stage show business and celebrity culture themes, such as ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[My Life on the D-List]]'', ''[[The Showbiz Show]]'', ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''.<ref name="EdgertonJones2008"/>

The show's most significant innovation is in celebrities essentially portraying themselves.<ref name=guardian1/> It was followed in its use of celebrity guests, its distaste for [[laugh track]]s, and in its perfection of the comedy of mortification  by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''.<ref name=timeout1/><ref name=guardian1/>
Shandling's performance is a precursor to [[Larry David]]'s in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' and even more directly to [[Ricky Gervais]] (''The Office'', ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'') as [[David Brent]].<ref name=rolling>{{cite web| url=http://www.rollingstoneme.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=250|title=Rewind: The Larry Sanders Show|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>
Gervais said in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that he was heavily influenced by the show and that "It taught me that flawed characters can be compulsive viewing&nbsp;— seeing them squirm and get their comeuppance".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/2010/tv/news/gervais-glad-to-be-part-of-the-hbo-family-1118026464/|title=Gervais glad to be part of the HBO family|accessdate=25 April 2013 | work=Variety}}</ref>
Matt Zoller Seitz wrote in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Los Angeles]]'' that it introduced to television the cinematic technique of "walk and talk" where the camera follows the actors as they move around the offices in conversation. This later became an important part of the style of ''[[The West Wing]]'' and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.<ref name=timeout1/>
The show can also be seen as a distorted example of [[reality television]] because the portrayal of the talk show production is so convincing.<ref name=washpost/>

According to Andrew Pulver in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "This is where it all began. The whole postmodernist, self-reflexive fact-fiction sitcom thing".<ref name=guardian1/>
