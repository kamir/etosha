'''''The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina''''' is a 2002 [[direct-to-video]] animated film directed by Glenn Chaika. Produced by [[Hyperion Pictures|Hyperion Animation]] and [[Miramax Films]], the film was distributed by [[Buena Vista Home Video]].

One of the few direct-to-video [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] releases that is not a sequel, the film unites two diminutive characters from folklore in an original adventure.

==Plot==
After being raised by a normal-sized man, tiny [[Tom Thumb]] (voiced by [[Elijah Wood]]) sets out to find others of his diminutive stature. He happens upon [[Thumbelina]] ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), a former circus performer, who is not only his size and age, but is also looking for others like her. But just as they meet, Thumbelina is taken prisoner by the comically sinister Mole King ([[Peter Gallagher]]), who wants to make her his bride.
