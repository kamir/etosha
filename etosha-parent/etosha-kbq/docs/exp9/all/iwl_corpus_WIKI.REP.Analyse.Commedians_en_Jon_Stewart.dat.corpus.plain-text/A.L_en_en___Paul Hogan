'''Paul Hogan''', [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 8 October 1939) is an [[Australia]]n comedian and actor.  He was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and won a [[Golden Globe]] award for his performance as Michael "Crocodile" Dundee in ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'' (1986).

==Early life==
Hogan was born in [[Lightning Ridge, Australia]]. Hogan went on to work as a rigger working on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].<ref>http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sydney-harbour-bridge</ref><ref>http://www.sydneyharbourbridge.info/</ref><ref>http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/ag-blog/2010/10/painting-the-sydney-harbour-bridge/</ref>

==Career==
Hogan rose to prominence in Australia during the early 1970s after an interview on ''[[A Current Affair]].'' Hogan followed this with his own comedy sketch program ''[[The Paul Hogan Show]]'', which he produced, wrote, and in which he played characters with [[John Cornell]].  The series, which ran for 60 episodes between 1973 and 1984, was popular in his native country, and South Africa, and showcased his trademark lighthearted but laddish [[ocker]] humour.  The early series was on Channel Seven and by 1975, it was screened on Channel Nine where it remained until 1984.

In the 1970s, he advertised [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]] cigarettes in television, print and billboard advertisements in which he wore a formal dinner suit.  These ads always ended with the catchphrase "Anyhow, have a Winfield". During the early 1980s, Hogan filmed a series of television ads promoting the Australian tourism industry, which aired in the United States.  An advertisement featuring the phrase "[[shrimp on the barbie]]" which aired from 1984, was particularly successful.<ref name="BakerBendel">{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=Bill |author2=Peggy Bendel |issue=Summer 2005  |url=http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm |title=Come and Say G’Day! |journal=Travel Marketing Decisions |publisher=The Association of Travel Marketing Executives |accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref>

In 1985, Hogan starred as an Australian [[World War 1]] 'digger' named Pat Cleary in the critically acclaimed mini-series [[Anzacs (TV series)|Anzacs]] which aired on the [[Nine Network]]. Cleary was described as the quintessential Aussie larrikin and series writer [[John Dixon (filmmaker)|John Dixon]] wrote the part of Cleary with Hogan in mind. The series included a "who's who" of Australian television and film actors of the day including [[Jon Blake (actor)|Jon Blake]], [[Andrew Clarke (actor)|Andrew Clarke]], [[Megan Williams (actress)|Megan Williams]], [[Tony Bonner]], [[Bill Kerr]], [[Ilona Rodgers]], [[Vivean Gray]] and [[Robert Coleby]].

Throughout the decade, he appeared on British TV in advertisements for [[Foster's Lager]], in which he played an earthy Australian abroad in London.  The character's most notable line (spoken incredulously at a ballet performance) "Struth, there's a bloke down there with no strides on!", followed Hogan for years, and the popularity of its "fish out of water" humour was repeated with his next endeavour.  In another advertisement from the same Foster's series, Hogan's character is approached in a [[London Underground|London Tube station]] by a Japanese tourist who asks, 'Do you know the way to [[Cockfosters]]?', to which Hogan replies (with a puzzled look on his face): "Drink it warm, mate."

Hogan's breakout role was that of Mick "Crocodile" Dundee in the 1986 film ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]''. He followed that role in 1988 with ''[["Crocodile" Dundee II]]''. The character made him popular in the United States, with phrases like, "That's not a knife, this is a knife" entering the [[lexicon]], though Hogan was troubled that the character was perceived as a cross between [[Chuck Norris]] and [[John Rambo]], and turned down roles similar to those due to their violent nature, commenting:

<blockquote>The movie scene is screaming out for the movie hero who doesn't kill 75 people... less of those [[Commando (1985 film)|commandos]], [[The Terminator|terminators]], [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|ex-terminators]] and squashers. Mick's a good role model. There's no malice in the fellow and he's human. He's not a wimp or a [[sissy]] just because he doesn't kill people.<ref name="office">''[[TV Week]]'' magazine, 4 June 1988, page 11. "Box office war" by Ivor Davies.</ref></blockquote>

In the early 1990s a Paramount executive pitched a concept of a Crocodile Dundee/Beverly Hills Cop [[fictional crossover|crossover]] movie.<ref><http://splitsider.com/2012/11/a-crocodile-dundee-crossover-and-two-other-rejected-ideas-for-beverly-hills-cop-iii/></ref>

Paul Hogan refused the starring role in the hit film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', choosing instead to make ''Almost an Angel'' (1990).<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/trivia</ref>

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he was featured in advertisements for the [[Subaru Outback]].

In 2001 Hogan returned to the role that made him famous with ''[[Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles]]''.

==Honours==
In 1985, Hogan was named [[Australian of the Year]].<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis, Wendy]] | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&recipientID=89 Australian of the Year website | Retrieved 25 March 2013]</ref>

In 1986 he received the award [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) "For service to tourism and entertainment".<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=887635&search_type=simple&showInd=true Australian Honours List 1986] | Retrieved 25 March 2013</ref>

==Personal life==
Hogan and his first wife, Noelene Edwards, married in 1958. They separated and divorced in 1981 and remarried less than one year later. A second divorce, initiated in 1986, was considered one of Australia's ugliest in celebrity circles.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/paul-hogan-marries-son-off/story-e6freq7x-1111115125567|title = Paul Hogan and Noelene marry son off|last = |first = |date = December 15, 2007|work = |accessdate = September 7, 2014}}</ref> Hogan married his ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'' co-star [[Linda Kozlowski]] in 1990.  He has five children with his first wife and one with his second wife. In October 2013, Kozlowski filed for divorce from Hogan, citing irreconcilable differences. He is an [[Australian Republican Movement|Australian Republican]].<ref>{{cite web|date=27 August 2000|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article/258699/dundee-and-son-on-the-comeback-trail|title=Dundee and son: on the comeback trail}}</ref>

===Tax problems===
Hogan has been named as one of a group in connection to a A$300&nbsp;million Australian tax fraud investigation called Operation Wickenby, investigating 23 companies for allegedly using overseas companies to hide income.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,23636,21218043-462,00.html |title=Paul Hogan linked to $300m tax fraud case |author=Susannah Moran |date=13 February 2007 | work=The Australian}}</ref> In July 2008, Hogan commented to [[Network Ten]] that he had "paid plenty of tax" in Australia and that he had nothing to fear from the [[Australian Taxation Office]] investigation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Paul Hogan taunts taxman; Come and get me you bastards |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23969191-5015795,00.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)]] |date=4 July 2008}}</ref>

In October 2008, Hogan scored a major victory in his tax fight with the Australian Crime Commission, who were forced to pay up to an estimated A$5&nbsp;million for legal bills dating back to 2006 and were required to return seized personal financial documents that they had admitted were irrelevant.<ref name="tax">{{cite news |author=Janet Fife-Yeomans and Vicky Roach |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24568267-5001021,00.html |title=Defiant Paul Hogan humbles tax case clowns |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)]] |date=29 October 2008}}</ref> Hogan has not been charged in connection with the investigation, which began in 2003.<ref name="tax"/>

On 18 June 2010 in the Australian High Court, Hogan lost a long-running legal battle to keep the contents of his tax documents secret, paving the way for details of his offshore accounts to be published. Earlier the same year, Australian media reported that the Australian Crime Commission was in the final stages of preparing to lay criminal charges of tax evasion against him, film producer [[John Cornell]] and their accountant Anthony Stewart, whom it suspects of channeling millions of dollars from the proceeds of the film ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'' and other films into [[Offshore bank|offshore]] [[tax havens]]. The release of the documents is expected to help finalize their case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/7832537/Crocodile-Dundee-Paul-Hogans-off-shore-tax-accounts-to-be-published.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Crocodile Dundee Paul Hogan's off-shore tax accounts to be published | first=Bonnie | last=Malkin | date=16 June 2010}}</ref>

On 20 August 2010, Hogan flew to Sydney for his mother's funeral. Upon arrival he was issued a Departure Prohibition Order by the Australian Taxation Office, which prevented him leaving the country until his alleged tax debt was paid or settled. The nation's tax office claims he owes taxes on A$37.5&nbsp;million of undeclared income.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1306024/Crocodile-Dundee-star-Paul-Hogan-trapped-Australian-taxman-unpaid-bill.html | location=UK | work=Daily Mail | title=Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan banned from leaving Australia by taxman over unpaid bill on £21.4m of undeclared income | date=25 August 2010}}</ref>  On 3 September, Hogan was granted permission to return to the US through an agreement between his lawyers and Australian tax officials, though the terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. Hogan continues to deny any wrongdoing in the case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38986923/ns/today-entertainment/ | location=US | work=MSNBC | title='Crocodile Dundee' to return to US amid tax fray | date=3 September 2010}}</ref>

In November 2010, the Australian Tax Office dropped its criminal investigation of him and his business manager for tax evasion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/24/us-paulhogan-tax-idUSTRE6AN0TB20101124 | location=Sidney,AU | work=Reuters | title=Crocodile Dundee's Paul Hogan gets early Christmas present | date=24 Nov 2010}}</ref>

In January 2011, it was announced that Hogan is suing the Australian government, his lawyer stating that Hogan's "earning potential and reputation has been decimated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blog/article/112376/crocodile-dundee-star-to-sue-australian-government.html |title=Crocodile Dundee star to sue Australian government |publisher=Uk.movies.yahoo.com |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref> Hogan has since likened the Australian Tax Office to the [[Taliban]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Black |first=Simon |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/man-as-hell-actor-paul-hogan-compares-ato-to-the-taliban/story-fn6bmg6l-1226018135926 |title=Paul Hogan likens the ATO to the Taliban |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref> and referred to staff as 'a-holes'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-17/hogan-says-ato-are-aholes/2844010 |title=Hogan lashes out at tax office 'A-holes' |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref>

In May 2012, it was announced that following mediation before ex-High Court Judge the entities settled with the Commissioner of Taxation in an agreement "without admission". The parties have agreed that the terms of the settlement are to be confidential, but as part of the settlement, the Departure Prohibition Order has been revoked by the Commissioner.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/business/paul-hogan-settles-tax-dispute-20120501-1xvmo.html Paul Hogan Settles Tax Dispute, Sydney Morning Herald]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/05/04/crocodile-tears-for-paul-hogan-tax-travails Crocodile Tears for Paul Hogan Tax Travails, Forbes]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17904063 Actor Paul Hogan's Australia tax battle over, BBC]</ref> As of April 2013, Hogan's financial advisor Stewart remained in a dispute with the Australian Tax Office.<ref name="Kate">{{cite news|title=Hogan chases his financial adviser and stolen millions|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/hogan-chases-his-financial-adviser-and-stolen-millions-20130414-2htu0.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 April 2013|author=Kate McClymont|author2=Francois Pilet}}</ref>

Hogan then reappeared in the media in April 2013 due to an AU$32.3 million issue with a Swiss bank run by the Geneva firm Strachans. Following the placement of the monetary sum in an offshore account for the purpose of tax avoidance, Hogan is unable to access the funds as of April 2013 and a United States court action that sought AU$80 million in damages proved unsuccessful for Hogan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Hogan's battle with Swiss firm for 'stolen' $32m|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/paul-hogans-battle-with-swiss-bank-for-stolen-32m/story-e6frg8zx-1226620346431|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=15 April 2013|author=Susannah Moran}}</ref> Hogan publicly stated that he believes that Philip Egglishaw, the principal of Strachans and a former tax advisor to Hogan, has absconded with the money and Hogan's American legal representative Schuyler "Sky" Moore filed corresponding documents in a Californian Court based on this claim.<ref name="Kate" /> On 18 April 2013, it was reported that Egglishaw denied the allegations of his former client.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philip Egglishaw denies Paul Hogan theft|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/philip-egglishaw-denies-paul-hogan-theft/story-e6frg8zx-1226623051046|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=18 April 2013|author=Susannah Moran}}</ref>
