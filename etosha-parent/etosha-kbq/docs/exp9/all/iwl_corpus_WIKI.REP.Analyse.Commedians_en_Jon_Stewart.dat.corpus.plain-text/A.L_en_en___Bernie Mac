'''Bernard Jeffrey''' "'''Bernie'''" '''McCullough''' (October 5, 1957 – August 9, 2008), better known by his stage name '''Bernie Mac''', was an American stand-up comedian, actor and voice artist. Born and raised on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago, Mac gained popularity as a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. He joined comedians [[Steve Harvey]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], and [[D. L. Hughley]] in ''[[The Original Kings of Comedy]]''.

After briefly hosting the [[HBO]] show ''Midnight Mac'', Mac appeared in several films in smaller roles. His most noted film role was as Frank Catton in the remake ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' and the titular character of ''[[Mr. 3000]]''. He was the star of ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', which ran from 2001 through 2006, earning him two [[Emmy Award]] nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Mac's other films included starring roles in ''[[Booty Call]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', ''[[The Players Club]]'', ''[[Head of State (film)|Head of State]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'', ''[[Bad Santa]]'', ''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who]]'', ''[[Pride (2007 film)|Pride]]'', ''[[Soul Men (film)|Soul Men]]'', ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''.

Mac suffered from [[sarcoidosis]], a disease in which abnormal collections of chronic inflammatory cells ([[granulomas]]) form as nodules in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and lymph nodes. Lung scarring or infection may lead to respiratory failure and death. Mac had mentioned the condition was in remission in 2005.<ref name=Grimes>{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title=Bernie Mac, Acerbic Stand-Up Comedian and Irascible TV Dad, Dies at 50|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/arts/television/10mac.html|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 Aug 2008}}</ref>  His death on August 9, 2008 was caused by complications from [[pneumonia]].

==Early life==
Mac was born Bernard Jeffrey McCullough in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on October 5, 1957. He was raised on the city's South Side by his single mother, Mary, who died of cancer when he was 16 years old in his sophomore year of high school.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005170/bio Bernie Mac - Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

He put on shows for neighborhood kids on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]]. He attended [[Chicago Vocational Career Academy]] where [[Dick Butkus]] also earlier attended. Later, Mac moved to [[Tampa, Florida]].<ref name="Savoy Magazine May 2002">Savoy Magazine May 2002</ref> During his 20s, he worked in a variety of jobs, including furniture mover and a [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] agent<ref name="Savoy Magazine May 2002"/>

==Career==
Bernie Mac's influences were from [[The Three Stooges]] and listening to stand-up comedians [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Redd Foxx]]. Mac started as a stand-up comedian in Chicago's Cotton Club. After he won the [[Miller Lite Comedy Search]] at the age of 32, his popularity as a comedian began to grow. A performance on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Def Comedy Jam]]'' thrust him into the spotlight; after [[Martin Lawrence]] was unable to calm an increasingly hostile crowd, Mac went onstage and famously said, "I ain't scared o' you motherfuckers", telling the audience that he "didn't come here for no foolishness". Mac's comedy and fearlessness onstage cemented his reputation with fans and colleagues.

He opened for [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Natalie Cole]]. He played a small role in 1994's ''[[House Party 3]]'' as Uncle Vester. He also had a short-lived talk show on HBO titled ''Midnight Mac''. Later, Mac also acted in minor roles and got his big break as "Pastor Clever" in [[Ice Cube]]'s 1995 film ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]''. Following that role, Mac had his first starring role as "Dollar Bill", a silly, slick-talking club owner in ''[[The Players Club]]''. Mac was able to break from the traditional "black comedy" genre, having roles in the 2001 remake of ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' and becoming the new Bosley for the ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' sequel, ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]''. In 2003, he gave an impressive performance in a supporting role as the villain "Gin Slagel, The Store Dick" in ''[[Bad Santa]]''. He also starred in ''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who?]]'', a comedic remake of the film ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', and made an appearance in the 2007 film ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' as the car salesman "Bobby Bolivia". In his later years, he hosted the reality television talent show ''Last Comic Standing''. He also served as the voice of Zuba, Alex the Lion's long lost father in ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''. He co-starred with [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the [[2008 in film|2008]] musical comedy ''[[Soul Men (film)|Soul Men]]'' as "Floyd Henderson". His final film role was as "Jimmy Lunchbox," a flamboyant children's entertainer in the [[2009 in film|2009]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney film]] ''[[Old Dogs (film)|Old Dogs]]'' which was released a year after his death. He starred alongside [[John Travolta]] and [[Robin Williams]] in that particular film.

[[File:BernieMacTransformersPremiereJune07.jpg|thumb|200px|Bernie Mac at the ''Transformers'' premiere in 2007]]
In 2001, the Fox network gave Mac his own semi-autobiographical sitcom called ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'' portraying a [[Bernie McCullough|fictional version of himself]]. In the show, he suddenly becomes [[Legal guardian|custodian]] of his sister's three children after she enters [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. It was a success, in part because it allowed Mac to stay true to his stand-up comedy roots, breaking the [[fourth wall]] to communicate his thoughts to the audience. The show contained many parodies of events in Bernie's actual life. Bernie, who grew up on Chicago's South Side, was a die-hard fan of the [[Chicago White Sox]], and would often sneak a reference to his favorite team in his episodes, including enlisting then White Sox pitcher [[Jon Garland]] to make a guest cameo appearance. Bernie Mac's "fourth wall" technique allowed him a moment of heartfelt sincerity during the sitcom's 2005 season when, sitting in his customary easy chair and facing the audience before the start of an episode, Bernie unabashedly donned a White Sox jacket and cap, and congratulated his hometown [[Chicago White Sox]] and their staff members, on their recent World Series championship.

The show was not renewed after the 2005–2006 season. The series finale aired on April 14, 2006. However, the finale barely left a conclusion for the series, and no ending to the storyline of Bernie and Wanda trying to have a baby which had been abandoned a few episodes earlier. Among other awards, the show won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/bernie-mac Bernie Mac Emmy Award Winner]</ref> for "Outstanding Writing", the [[Peabody Award]] for excellence in broadcasting, and the [[Humanitas Prize]] for television writing that promotes human dignity.<ref>[http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/mac/2871519 Bernie Mac obituary]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> His character on ''The Bernie Mac Show'' was ranked #47 in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'s}} list of the "50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time".<ref>June 20, 2004 issue</ref>

In 2004, Bernie Mac starred as a retired [[baseball]] player in the film ''[[Mr. 3000]]''. In the [[2003 National League Championship Series]], Mac sang "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" at [[Wrigley Field]] with the [[Chicago Cubs]] leading the [[Florida Marlins]] in the series 3 games to 2 and in Game 6 by a 2–0 score at the time (it would soon be 3–0 in the bottom of the 7th). Instead of saying "root, root, root for the Cubbies" Mac said, "root, root, root for the champs!, champs!" The Cubs lost the game and the series, with some fans claiming that Mac helped [[jinx]] the Cubs. Mac later admitted that he had hated the North Side's Cubs his whole life, being a die-hard fan of the South Side's [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]], and was seen during the White Sox' [[2005 World Series]] victory at [[U.S. Cellular Field]].

Mac was number 72 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest standups of all time. On March 19, 2007, Mac told [[David Letterman]] on the CBS ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' that he would retire from his 30-year career after he finished shooting the comedy film, ''The Whole Truth, Nothing but the Truth, So Help Me Mac''. "I'm going to still do my producing, my films, but I want to enjoy my life a little bit", Mac told Letterman. "I missed a lot of things, you know. I was a street performer for two years. I went into clubs in 1977 and was on the road 47 weeks out of the year."<ref>[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/21/74332.shtml?s=en Bernie Mac Plans to Retire From Standup]. NewsMax.com</ref>

==Illness and death==
In 2008, Mac was admitted to the [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] in his hometown of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. After a week of unsuccessful medical treatment, Mac went into cardiac arrest and died during the early morning hours of August 9, from [[sarcoidosis]] complicated by pneumonia. In the final three years of his life, Mac publicly disclosed that he had suffered from sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown origin that causes inflammation in tissue. Sarcoidosis frequently attacked Mac's lungs.<ref name=Death>{{cite web | title =Actor and comedian Bernie Mac dies at age 50 | url =http://cbs2chicago.com/local/bernie.mac.dead.2.791473.html| authorlink=Suzanne Le Mignot|last=Le Mignot|first=Suzanne|date=August 9, 2008|publisher=CBS2Chicago|accessdate=2010-03-27}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> Mac's public funeral was held a week after his death at the House of Hope Church with nearly 7,000 people in attendance.<ref name=Funeral>{{cite web|title=Bernie Mac's Funeral: "The Hottest Ticket in Town" |url=http://www.whudat.com/newsblurbs/more/bernie-macs-funeral-the-hottest-ticket-in-town-1680817081|date=August 17, 2008|publisher=WhuDat|accessdate=2013-02-21}}</ref> Notable mourners at Mac's funeral were [[Chris Rock]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard M.

===Tributes===

Mac's third and final posthumous film, ''[[Old Dogs (film)|Old Dogs]]'', was released a year after his death. The 2008 [[Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic|Bud Billiken Parade]], which was held in Chicago at the time of Mac's death, was also dedicated to his memory.<ref name=Death/> On the day of Mac's funeral, his hometown's local television station [[WCIU-TV]] aired an exclusive television special, ''A Tribute to Bernie Mac'', and had interviews with his former colleagues including [[Camille Winbush]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Joe Torry]] and some of his family members and close friends.
