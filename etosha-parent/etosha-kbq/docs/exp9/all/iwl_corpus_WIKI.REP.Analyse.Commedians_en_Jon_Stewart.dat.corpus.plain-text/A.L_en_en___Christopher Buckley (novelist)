==Life==
After a classical education at the [[Portsmouth Abbey School]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/Pop-Culture/Celebrity-Spotlight/Mr.-Right|title=Mr. Righ|publisher=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2010|first=Andrew|last=Goldman}}</ref> Buckley graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1975.<ref>[http://opac.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=6706 "Yale Class Day Speaker: Christopher Buckley"], Yale University, Office of Public Affairs and Communications, May 24, 2009</ref> He was a member of [[Skull and Bones]] like his father, living at [[Jonathan Edwards College]].<ref name="robbins">{{cite book | author=[[Alexandra Robbins|Robbins, Alexandra]] | title=Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power |publisher=[[Little, Brown]] | location=Boston | year=2002 |isbn=0-316-72091-7 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ccoJBdbp558C&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>{{rp|173}} He became managing editor of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.

In 1981, he moved to Washington, D.C., to work as chief [[speechwriter]] for Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]]. This experience led to his novel ''[[The White House Mess]]'', a satire on [[White House]] office politics and political memoirs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDowell|first1=Edwin|title=2 Buckleys Become Best Sellers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/16/specials/buckley-bestsellers.html|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=The New York Times|date=16 April 1986|quote=The author's insights into the corridors of power were acquired during the year and a half he spent as a speech writer for Vice President Bush, starting in 1981.}}</ref> (The title refers to the White House lunchroom, which is known as the "[[mess]]" because the [[United States Navy|Navy]] operates it.)

Buckley's ''[[Thank You for Smoking (novel)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' is another satire, its protagonist a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, [[Nick Naylor]]. He followed that with more humor about Washington in the form of ''[[Little Green Men (novel)|Little Green Men]]'', about the government agency investigating UFO sightings. His ''[[No Way To Treat A First Lady]]'' has the president's wife on trial for assassinating her husband and ''[[Florence of Arabia]]'' is about a do-gooding [[State Department]] bureaucrat in the Middle East. His one serious novel, ''Wet Work'', is about a billionaire businessman avenging his granddaughter's death from drugs.

''Thank You for Smoking'' was adapted into [[Thank You for Smoking (film)|a movie]] written and directed by [[Jason Reitman]], and starring [[Aaron Eckhart]]. It was released on 17 March 2006.

Buckley also wrote the non-fiction ''[[Steaming To Bamboola]]'', about the [[merchant marine]], as well as contributed to an oral history of [[Milford, Connecticut]], and is an editor at ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.  Buckley has written for many national newspapers and magazines, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'', ''[[US News & World Report]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Conde Nast Traveler]]'' and numerous humorous essays in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Obama endorsement==
For a brief time in summer and fall 2008, Christopher Buckley also wrote the back-page column for ''[[National Review]]'', the conservative magazine founded by his father. This came to an end after Buckley endorsed the 2008 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|presidential nominee]] [[Barack Obama]] in October 2008. Buckley's endorsement, entitled "Sorry Dad, I'm Voting for Obama",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-10/the-conservative-case-for-obama|title=Sorry, Dad, I'm Voting for Obama|accessdate=2009-02-04 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref> appeared in ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.
