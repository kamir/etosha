The [[New York City|New York]]-born DeCaro is the author of ''The Dead Celebrity Cookbook: A Resurrection of Recipes From More Than 145 Stars of Stage and Screen'' (HCI Books, 2011), its sequel, "The Dead Celebrity Cookbook Presents Christmas in Tinseltown: Celebrity Recipes and Hollywood Memories from Six Feet Under the Mistletoe" (HCI, 2012), ''Unmistakably Mackie: The Fashion and Fantasy of [[Bob Mackie]]'' (Universe, 1999), and ''A Boy Named Phyllis: A Suburban Memoir'' (Viking 1996).

DeCaro grew up in [[Little Falls, New Jersey]], and graduated in 1980 from [[Passaic Valley Regional High School]] in Little Falls.<ref>[[Joe Sharkey|Sharkey, Joe]].
