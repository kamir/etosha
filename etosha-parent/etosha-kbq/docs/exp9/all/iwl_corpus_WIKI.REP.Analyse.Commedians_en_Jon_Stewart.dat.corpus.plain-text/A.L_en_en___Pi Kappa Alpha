'''Pi Kappa Alpha''' ('''ΠΚΑ''') or '''Pike''' is a [[Fraternities and sororities|college fraternity]] founded at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1868. The fraternity has over 220 chapters and colonies across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] with over 15,500 undergraduate members and 270,000 lifetime initiates. Originally a [[Racial segregation|white-only]] [[Southern United States|southern]] organization, the fraternity became a national fraternity in 1909, and removed its racial restrictions in 1964.<ref name=Hughey /><ref name=AUP />

==History==
Pi Kappa Alpha was founded on Sunday evening March 1, 1868, at 47 West Range ([[The Range]]) at the [[University of Virginia]], by [[Robertson Howard]], [[Julian Edward Wood]], [[James Benjamin Sclater Jr.]], [[Frederick Southgate Taylor]], [[Littleton Waller Tazewell Bradford]] and [[William C. Alexander (1848–1937)|William Alexander]].<ref name="pike.org History">{{cite web|url=http://www.pikes.org/historyA.aspx|title=Founding History|author=Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> On March 1, 1869, exactly one year after the Alpha Chapter at the University of Virginia was formed, the Beta Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was founded at [[Davidson College]].<ref name="Beta Chapter History">{{cite web|url=http://www.davidson.edu/student/organizations/pika/|title=A History of Beta|author=Beta Chapter, Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> Theta Chapter, at Rhodes College, took over the responsibilities of Alpha chapter when the Fraternity was in decline in its infancy. John Shaw Foster, a junior founder from Theta Chapter, helped to reestablish Alpha Chapter at the University of Virginia. Theta Chapter is the longest continual running chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha since its inception in 1878. After almost a decade of decline, Pi Kappa Alpha was "re-founded" as part of the Hampden-Sydney Convention, held in a dorm room at [[Hampden–Sydney College]]. The four delegates to the Hampden-Sydney Convention are referred to as the Junior Founders. Pi Kappa Alpha was not originally organized as a sectional fraternity, however by constitutional provision it became so in 1889.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=2iErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA301 Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, 1920 Edition, page 306]</ref> It remained a southern fraternity until the New Orleans Convention in 1909 when Pi Kappa Alpha officially declared itself a national organization.<ref name=1970PledgeGuide>{{cite book|title=Garnet & Gold Pledge Guide|year=1970|publisher=Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity|edition=15th}}</ref>

Originally, Pi Kappa Alpha's membership was restricted to white men, but the race restriction was removed in 1964.<ref name=Hughey>{{cite journal|last=Hughey|first=Matthew W|title=Black, White, Greek...Like Who?: Howard University Student Perceptions of a White Fraternity on Campus|journal=Educational Foundations|date=Win–Spr 2006|volume=20|issue=1-2|pages=9–35|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/EJ751759.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>
