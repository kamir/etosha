==Mission and purpose==

===Mission===
<blockquote>Thomas Edison State College provides flexible, high-quality, collegiate learning opportunities for self-directed adults.<ref name="Mission and Purpose">{{cite web|title=Mission and Purpose|url=http://www.tesc.edu/about/mission.cfm|publisher=Thomas Edison State College|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

The College was founded for the purpose of providing diverse and alternative methods of achieving a collegiate education of the highest quality for mature adults.<ref name="Mission and Purpose" /></blockquote>

==Campus==
Thomas Edison State College moved into downtown [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] in September 1979, at a time when other institutions were leaving cities. The 7-year-old college, which had spent three years at the Forrestal Center outside of Princeton, needed room for growth. At the same time, the state was looking for an appropriate tenant for the landmark Kelsey Building located adjacent to [[New Jersey State House|New Jersey's State House]] complex and the State House historic district, while the city sought to preserve the building's historic use as a school. Behind the Kelsey Building and Townhouses is Petty's Run (now being excavated as part of a state-funded project), which flows to the Delaware River. In the early 1730s, Petty's Run powered a plating mill, and by midcentury drove a steel furnace.<ref>[http://www.destinationtrenton.com/listings/BENJAMIN-YARD-IRON-WORKS-AND-PETTY-S-RUN/127/ "BENJAMIN YARD IRON WORKS AND PETTYâ€™S RUN"] ''Destination Tenton''. Retrieved 2014-1-13.</ref>

Built in 1911 by A. Henry Cooper Kelsey, the Kelsey Building is one of the architectural landmarks of the city.<ref name="The Kelsey Building, 1911">[http://trentonhistory.org/Kelsey.htm "The Kelsey Building, 1911"] Trenton Historical Society. Retrieved March 7, 2014.</ref> It housed three other schools before serving as the headquarters for Thomas Edison State College. The architecture of the Kelsey Building is modeled after a Florentine palace, the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]. The main structure was designed in 1910 by world-renowned architect Cass Gilbert (designer of New York City's [[Woolworth Building]]).<ref>[http://www.destinationtrenton.com/about-trenton/colleges/thomas-edison-state-college/ "Thomas Edison State College"] ''Destination Trenton''.

The college's campus has expanded over the years and currently includes the Kelsey Building, the Townhouse Complex, the Center for Learning and Technology, and Kuser Mansion, all on West State Street. The Academic Center and Canal Banks Building are located on West Hanover Street.

Thomas Edison State College has been active in restoring several historic buildings of downtown Trenton, preserving the essence of the city's legendary past and stimulating economic development.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/highereducation/IP/IP2012/ThomasEdison/I.pdf "Thomas Edison State College"] NJ Higher Education.

===Obtaining credit at Thomas Edison State College===
*Online courses are delivered via the Internet. Students in online courses communicate with mentors and fellow students using email and submit assignments to mentors through myEdisonÂ®, the College's online course management system.
*E-PackÂ® courses are suitable for independent distance learners who want the structure of a semester-based course, but do not require mentor guidance and do not wish to complete written assignments. Students take a series of quizzes to prepare for a final exam. These courses are "pass" or "fail" only and do not result in a traditional letter grade.
*Examination programs including our TECEPÂ® tests, enable students to demonstrate the college-level knowledge they have gained through work, personal interests or independent study by taking a single examination. Examinations are "pass" or "fail" only and do not result in a traditional letter grade.<ref name="Credit By Exam">{{cite web|title=Credit By Exam|url=http://www.tesc.edu/degree-completion/Testing.cfm|publisher=Thomas Edison State College|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>
*Portfolio Assessment provides students with the opportunity to work with a mentor to demonstrate that they possess college-level knowledge in a subject and earn credit toward their degree. Portfolio Assessment is a rewarding way to earn college credit because it acknowledges and validates the learning a student has acquired outside of a traditional classroom setting.<ref name="Prior Learning Assessment">{{cite web|title=Prior Learning Assessment|url=http://www.tesc.edu/degree-completion/PLA.cfm|publisher=Thomas Edison State College|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>
*Guided Study courses are designed for highly independent learners and are structured around weekly readings, DVD/video and/or audio tapes and written assignments.
