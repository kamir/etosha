'''James Zadroga''' (February 8, 1971<ref>As listed on the memorial stone in Zadroga Field, North Arlington, New Jersey</ref> &ndash; January 5, 2006) was a [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) officer who died of a [[respiratory disease]] that has been attributed to his participation in rescue and recovery operations in the rubble of the [[World Trade Center]] following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Zadroga was the first NYPD officer whose death was attributed to exposure to his contact with toxic chemicals at the attack site.<ref name=CBSNews>Smith, Stephen.

Accessed September 12, 2008.</ref>

Zadroga had joined the New York City Police Department in 1992 and attained the rank of [[Detective]]. He was a healthy non-smoker and had no known history of [[asthma]] or other respiratory conditions before spending 450 hours participating in the recovery efforts at the 9/11 attack site.<ref name=NYT2006/> Weeks after his time at the World Trade Center site, Zadroga developed a persistent [[cough]], and, as the months progressed, he developed shortness of breath and became unable to walk distances more than 100 feet without gasping for air.<ref>Editorial.

The [[September 11th Victim Compensation Fund]] awarded Zadroga a monetary settlement in excess of $1M in 2004, after determining that his exposure to dust at Ground Zero had caused his respiratory illness. The New York City Police Department Medical Board approved his application for permanent disability retirement that same year, after concluding that his illness was related to dust exposure.<ref name=NYT20071026/>

==Cause of death==
The causes of Zadroga's death are under dispute.<ref name=Scienceline2010>Johnson, Madeleine.

Accessed December 8, 2010.</ref> Gerard Breton, a [[pathology|pathologist]] of the [[Ocean County, New Jersey]] [[medical examiner]]'s office, conducted an [[autopsy]] in April 2006, and he reported, "It is felt with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the cause of death in this case was directly related to the 9/11 incident."<ref name=NYT2006>DePalma, Anthony. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/14/nyregion/14dust.html "Debate Revives as 9/11 Dust Is Called Fatal"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 14, 2006. Accessed September 13, 2008.</ref> This attribution made Zadroga, 34-years-old at the time of his death, the first 9/11 responder whose death was directly linked with toxic Ground Zero substances.<ref name=CBSNews/> Breton's autopsy found what he described as "unidentified foreign materials" in Zadroga's lungs,<ref name=NYT20061007/> which were identified by the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as [[talc]], [[cellulose]], [[calcium phosphate]], and [[methacrylate]] plastic;<ref name=NYT20071026>DePalma, Anthony.

Accessed September 13, 2008.</ref> However, the examination did not compare the particles found in his lungs with actual dust from the World Trade Center site.<ref name=NYT20061007/>

The [[New York City Medical Examiners Office]] asserted in October 2007 that Zadroga's death was not related to his time at Ground Zero, with Chief Medical Examiner [[Charles Hirsch]] and another medical examiner signing a statement that "It is our unequivocal opinion, with certainty beyond doubt, that the foreign material in your son’s lungs did not get there as the result of inhaling dust at the World Trade Center or elsewhere".<ref name=NYT20061007>McFadden, Robert D.

Accessed September 13, 2008.</ref> Hirsch concluded that Zadroga died from self-injection of ground drugs, with Hirsch finding severe scarring in his lungs that he determined was caused by cellulose and talc granulomas and stating (through a spokesperson) that "The lung disease he had was a consequence of injecting prescription drugs".<ref name=DailyNews/> Officials from the Chief Medical Examiner's office met with the Zadroga family to present his findings.<ref>DePalma, Anthony.

In response to the City Medical Examiner's autopsy results, [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] stated "We wanted to have a hero, and there are plenty of heroes, it’s just in this case, science says this was not a hero" at remarks made after receiving an award from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], but backed away from his earlier characterization at a news conferences stating that "This was a great N.Y.P.D. officer who dedicated himself — put his life in harm’s way hundreds of times during his career — and you can use your own definition."<ref>Cardwell, Diane.

A third opinion obtained by Zadroga's family later that month from Dr. [[Michael Baden]], chief forensic pathologist of the [[New York State Police]] (and former New York City Medical Examiner), backed the original claim of WTC dust responsibility, citing the presence of glass fibers in Zadroga's lungs that could not be related to injecting drugs. James' father, Joseph, said that the medical examiner reported no "track marks on his arms or body" and that his son had taken anti-[[anxiety]] medications and [[painkiller]]s including [[OxyContin]], but had never ground up and injected the drugs.<ref name=DailyNews>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/10/26/2007-10-26_city_says_drug_use_not_dust_killed_911_h-2.html "City says drug use, not dust killed 9/11 hero James Zadroga."] ''[[Daily News (New York)]]'', October 26, 2007.

Zadroga had been married. His wife, Rhonda, had died in Florida in October 2003, where Sheriff's Deputies noted the presence of needle marks on her body and the coroner's report detailed numerous drugs, including methadone (a drug typically used to ease withdrawal from opiates like heroin) in her blood."<ref>Kahn, Jennifer.
