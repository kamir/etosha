The '''National Broadcasting Company''' ('''NBC''') is an [[United States|American]] [[commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network|television]] and [[radio network]] that is the flagship property of [[NBCUniversal]], a subsidiary of [[Comcast]]. The network is headquartered in the [[Comcast Building]] (formerly known as the [[GE Building]]) at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]], with additional major offices near [[Los Angeles]] (at [[10 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California|Universal City Plaza]]) and in [[Chicago]] (at the [[NBC Tower]]). NBC is sometimes referred to as the "Peacock Network", in reference to its [[NBC logos|stylized peacock logo]], which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979.

Founded in 1926 by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), NBC is the oldest major broadcast network in the United States. In 1986, control of NBC passed to [[General Electric]] (GE) – which previously owned RCA and NBC until 1930, when it was forced to sell the companies as a result of [[antitrust]] charges – through its $6.4 billion purchase of RCA. Following the acquisition by GE (which later sold RCA), [[Bob Wright]] served as [[chief executive officer]] of NBC, remaining in that position until his retirement in 2007, when he was succeeded by [[Jeff Zucker]]. In 2003, French media company [[Vivendi]] merged its entertainment assets with GE, forming NBC Universal. Comcast purchased a controlling interest in the company in 2011, and acquired General Electric's remaining stake in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comcast Completes Acquisition Of GE's 49% Stake In NBCUniversal|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/comcast-completes-acquisition-nbcuniversal/|author=David Lieberman|work=[[Deadline.com]]|date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> Following the Comcast merger, Zucker left NBCUniversal and was replaced as CEO by Comcast executive [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]].

NBC has eleven [[owned-and-operated station]]s and nearly 200 affiliates throughout the United States and its territories, some of which are also available in [[Canada]] via pay television providers or in [[Canada–United States border|border areas]] over-the-air; NBC also maintains brand licensing agreements for international channels in [[South Korea]] and [[Germany]].<ref name="NBCuni.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcuni.com/About_NBC_Universal/Company_Overview/overview02.shtml |publisher=NBC Universal|title=Company Overview|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name="myinfo24.com">{{cite web|title=List of United States over-the-air television networks|url=http://www.myinfo24.com/index.php?vc=2&visilex_key=List_of_United_States_over-the-air_television_networks_0dca.html|publisher=Entomology|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:GE Building Oct 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[GE Building]] in [[New York City]] serves as the headquarters of NBC.]]
===Radio===
====Earliest stations: WEAF and WJZ====
During a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) had acquired [[New York City]] radio station [[WNBC (AM)|WEAF]] from [[American Telephone & Telegraph]] (AT&T). [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in [[Newark, New Jersey]] pioneer station [[WABC (AM)#As WJZ|WJZ]] (no relation to the [[WJZ (AM)|radio]] and [[WJZ-TV|television]] station in [[Baltimore]] currently using those call letters), which also served as the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.<ref name="WABC Great Signal">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradio77.com/transm.html|title=Why Did WABC Have Such a Great Signal? |author=Allan Sniffen|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T's manufacturing and supply outlet [[Western Electric]], whose products included transmitters and antennas. The [[Bell System]], AT&T's telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The 1922 creation of WEAF offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of "chain" or "networking" broadcasting, the station linked with [[The Outlet Company|Outlet Company]]-owned [[WJAR]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; and with AT&T's station in Washington, D.C., [[WCAP (defunct)|WCAP]].

New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station [[WTEM|WRC]] in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality [[telegraph]] lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.

In 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company's primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T's phone lines for network transmission.<ref name=book>{{cite book|title=American Radio Networks: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tpxGeViyuPwC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Blue+Network+becomes+ABC+on+June+15,+1945&source=bl&ots=b2VbqtpFWC&sig=5YRHdEGKUyVjoWI766BZ-Z-XP4M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mBXnUpG-DuiMyAHg6IHICQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Blue%20Network%20becomes%20ABC%20on%20June%2015%2C%201945&f=false|author=Jim Cox|year=2009|pages=14–98|isbn=978-0-7864-4192-1}}</ref>

====Red and Blue Networks====
{{main|NBC Red Network|Blue Network}}
RCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shut down the latter station and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Announcing the National Broadcasting Company, Inc.|url=http://earlyradiohistory.us/1926nbc.htm|publisher=United States Early Radio History|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref> The division's ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent [[General Electric]] (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.

WEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side-by-side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the "[[NBC Red Network|Red Network]]" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the "[[Blue Network]]" mostly carried sustaining – or non-sponsored – broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the [[pushpin]]s NBC engineers used to designate affiliates of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils. A similar two-part/two-color strategy was utilized in the recording industry, dividing the market between [[classical music|classical]] (''cf.'' [[RCA Red Seal]]) and [[popular music|popular]] offerings.

[[File:NBC Hollywood Radio City West.JPG|right|thumb|230px|Radio City West was located at [[Sunset Boulevard]] and [[Vine Street]] in Los Angeles until it was replaced by a bank in the mid-1960s.]]
On April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at [[KNBR|KPO]] in San Francisco. The Orange Network name was removed from use in 1936, and the network's [[network affiliate|affiliate]] stations became part of the Red Network. At the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network. In the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for [[shortwave]] radio stations, called the NBC White Network.

In 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|title=Streetscapes: Where the Peacock Nested and the Mice Presided|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/realestate/21streets.html?8dpc|author=Christopher Gray|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref> The space that NBC occupied was designed by [[Raymond Hood]], who based the appearance of its multiple studio facilities on "a Gothic church, the Roman forum, a [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] room and, in a space devoted to jazz, something 'wildly futuristic, with plenty of color in bizarre designs.'"<ref name="nyt"/> NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.<ref name="nyt"/>

In 1930, General Electric was charged with [[antitrust]] violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new [[Rockefeller Center]] in 1931. [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman [[Owen D. Young]] and RCA president [[David Sarnoff]]. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the "RCA Building" (now the GE Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned [[RKO Pictures]].<ref>RCA Lead Tenant of Rockefeller Center, see: {{cite book|title=The Rockefeller Century|author=John Esnor Harr|author2=Peter J. Johnson|publisher=Scribner's|location=New York City|year=1988|page=326|isbn=0-684-18936-4}}</ref>

====Chimes====
{{Main|NBC chimes}}
[[File:NBC Studios entrance 2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance at the GE Building.]]
The iconic three-note [[NBC chimes]] came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E'-C', was first heard over Red Network affiliate [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] in [[Atlanta]],<ref>WSB was the originating station for a 1930 broadcast of [[Charles Davis Tillman]], which spread the appeal of [[Southern Gospel]] to NBC listeners network-wide.</ref> with a [[Inversion (music)|second inversion]] [[Triad (music)|C Major triad]] as its outline. An executive at NBC's New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech football]] game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first [[sound trademark|audio trademark]] to be accepted by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC Chimes Museum|url=http://www.nbcchimes.info/|work=NBCchimes.info|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Three Famous Notes of Broadcasting History - The NBC Chimes|url=http://www.radioremembered.org/chimes.htm|author=Bill Harris|work=Radio Remembered|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>

A variant sequence with an additional note, G-E'-C'-G, known as "the fourth chime", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during [[World War II]], especially in the wake of the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; on [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder [[Richard H. Ranger]]; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations manned by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference to the General Electric Company (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose [[Schenectady, New York]] radio station, [[WGY (AM)|WGY]], was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network, most notably incorporated into the [[John Williams]]-composed theme music used by NBC News, "[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]" (first composed in 1985 for ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'').

{{Further|Blue Network|American Broadcasting Company}}
In 1934, following the government agency's creation, the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] filed a complaint to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System ([[CBS]]). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the [[monopoly|monopolistic]] effects of network broadcasting. A report published by Commission in 1939 found that NBC's two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the Commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. 

After Mutual's appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942,<ref>{{cite news|title=Red and Blue Networks of NBC To Be Split; WJZ May Be Sold|author=Thomas P. Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either "Blue" or "Blue Network", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply "NBC".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mediahistoryproject.org/2011/09/17/the-end-of-nbc-red-and-blue/|author=David Pierce|title=The End of NBC Red and Blue|date=September 17, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> Investment firm [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president [[David Sarnoff]].

After losing on final appeal before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by [[Life Savers]] magnate [[Edward John Noble|Edward J. Noble]]. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943,<ref>{{cite news|title=Approves Buying of Blue Network|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 13, 1943}}</ref> Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] in [[San Francisco]] and WENR in [[Chicago]], which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]]); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station [[WMCA]]. Noble, who wanted a better name for the network, acquired the branding rights to the "[[American Broadcasting Company]]" name from [[Storer Communications|George B. Storer]] in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed.<ref name=book/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Radio: A Complete Guide to the Industry|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MQTXjvYu8ugC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=Blue+Network+becomes+ABC+on+June+15,+1945&source=bl&ots=SD-Rruv2xI&sig=d-gQuIvlqf8F8w0QpeMYrNcOXHA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mBXnUpG-DuiMyAHg6IHICQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Blue%20Network%20becomes%20ABC%20on%20June%2015%2C%201945&f=false|author=William A.

====Defining radio's golden age====
<!-- This section is linked from [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] -->
{{Main|NBC Radio Network}}
[[File:NBC Tower, Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|215px|The front entrance of the [[NBC Tower]] at 454 N. Columbus Drive in Chicago.]]
NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. [[Al Jolson]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Fred Allen]], and [[Burns and Allen]] called NBC home, as did [[Arturo Toscanini]]'s [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], which the network helped him create. Other programs featured on the network included ''[[Vic and Sade]]'', ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'', ''[[The Great Gildersleeve]]'' (arguably broadcasting's first [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] program, from ''Fibber McGee''), ''[[One Man's Family]]'', ''[[Ma Perkins]]'' and ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. NBC stations were often the most powerful, and some occupied unique [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] national frequencies, reaching hundreds or thousands of miles at night.

In the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation's top radio star, Jack Benny, many NBC performers – including Edgar Bergen and [[Charlie McCarthy]], Burns and Allen and [[Frank Sinatra]] – jumped to CBS.

In addition, NBC stars began migrating to television, including comedian [[Milton Berle]], whose ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' on the network became television's first major hit. Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952. The concerts were broadcast on both television and radio, in what perhaps was the first such instance of [[simulcast]]ing. Two of the concerts were historic firsts – the first complete telecast of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No. 9]], and the first complete telecast of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' (starring [[Herva Nelli]] and [[Richard Tucker]]), performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes.

Aiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured, and to challenge CBS's Sunday night radio lineup, which featured much of the programs and talent that had to moved that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'' in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio's earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend [[Tallulah Bankhead]] as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, [[Groucho Marx]], [[Lauritz Melchior]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Ethel Merman]], Bob Hope, [[Danny Thomas]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. However, ''The Big Show''{{'}}s initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers. The show lasted two years, with NBC losing around $1 million on the project (the network was only able to sell advertising time during the middle half-hour of the program each week).

NBC's last major radio programming push, beginning on June 12, 1955, was ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'', a creation of NBC President [[Sylvester "Pat" Weaver]], who also created the innovative programs ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''Home'' for the companion television network. ''Monitor'' was a continuous all-weekend mixture of music, news, interviews and features, with a variety of hosts including well-known television personalities [[Dave Garroway]], [[Hugh Downs]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] and [[Gene Rayburn]]. The potpourri show tried to keep vintage radio alive by featuring segments from Jim and Marian Jordan (in character as Fibber McGee and Molly); [[Peg Lynch]]'s dialog comedy ''[[Ethel and Albert]]'' (with Alan Bunce); and iconoclastic satirist [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]]. ''Monitor'' was a success for a number of years, but after the mid-1960s, local stations, especially those in larger markets, were reluctant to break from their established formats to run non-conforming network programming. One exception was ''Toscanini: The Man Behind the Legend'', a weekly series commemorating the great conductor's NBC broadcasts and recordings which ran for several years beginning in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|title=Explore Toscanini: The Man Behind the Legend: List View|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/TNMBL/browse/?start=170|work=UNT Digital Library}}</ref> After ''Monitor'' ended its 20-year run on January 26, 1975, little remained of NBC network radio beyond hourly newscasts and news features, and Sunday morning religious program ''[[The Eternal Light]]''.

====Decline====
On June 18, 1975, NBC launched the NBC News and Information Service (NIS), which provided up to 55 minutes of news per hour around the clock to local stations that wanted to adopt an [[all-news radio]] format. NBC carried the service on WRC in Washington, and on its owned-and-operated FM stations in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. NIS attracted several dozen subscribing stations, but by the fall of 1976, NBC determined that it could not project that the service would ever become profitable and gave its affiliates six months' notice that it would be discontinued. NIS ended operations on May 29, 1977. In 1979, NBC launched The Source, a modestly successful secondary network providing news and short features to [[FM broadcasting in the United States|FM]] [[rock music|rock]] stations.<ref name=book/>

The NBC Radio Network also pioneered personal advice call-in national [[talk radio]] with a satellite-distributed evening talk show, TalkNet; the program featured Bruce Williams (providing personal financial advice), Bernard Meltzer (personal and financial advice) and [[Sally Jessy Raphael]] (personal and romantic advice). While never much of a ratings success, TalkNet nonetheless helped further the national talk radio format. For affiliates, many of them struggling AM stations, TalkNet helped fill evening time slots with free programming, allowing the stations to sell local advertising in a dynamic format without the cost associated with producing local programming. Some in the industry feared this trend would lead to increasing control of radio content by networks and syndicators.

General Electric acquired RCA in 1986, and with it NBC, signaling the beginning of the end of NBC Radio. Three factors led to the radio division's demise: GE decided that radio did not fit its strategy, while the radio division had not been profitable for many years. In addition, FCC ownership rules at the time prevented companies acquiring broadcast properties from owning both a radio and television division. In the summer of 1987, GE sold NBC Radio's network operations to [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]], and sold off the NBC-owned stations to various buyers. By 1990, the NBC Radio Network as an independent programming service was pretty much dissolved, becoming a brand name for content produced by Westwood One, and ultimately by, ironically, [[CBS Radio]]. The Mutual Broadcasting System, which Westwood One had acquired two years earlier, met the same fate, and essentially merged with NBC Radio.

GE's divestiture of NBC's entire radio division was the first cannon shot of what would play out in the national broadcast media, as each of the Big Three broadcast networks were soon acquired by other corporate entities. NBC was a particularly noteworthy case in that it was the first to be acquired – and was bought by a conglomerate ''outside'' the broadcast industry as GE otherwise primarily served as a manufacturing company. Prior to the GE acquisition, NBC operated its radio division partly out of tradition, and partly to meet its then-FCC-mandated requirement to distribute programming for the public good (the broadcast airwaves are owned by the public; as that broadcast spectrum is limited and only so many broadcast stations existed, this served as the basis for government regulation requiring broadcasters to provide certain content that meets the needs of the public). Syndicators such as Westwood One were not subject to such rules as they did not own any stations. GE's divestiture of NBC Radio – known as "America's First Network" – in many ways marked the "beginning of the end" of the old era of regulated broadcasting and the ushering in of the new, largely unregulated industry that is present today.

By the late 1990s, Westwood One was producing NBC Radio-branded newscasts on weekday mornings. These were discontinued in 1999, and the few remaining NBC Radio Network affiliates became affiliates of [[CNN|CNN Radio]], carrying the Westwood-owned service's hourly newscasts 24 hours a day. In 2003, Westwood One began distributing NBC News Radio, a new service featuring minute-long news updates read by television anchors and reporters from NBC News and MSNBC, with content written by Westwood One employees.

====Restoration====
On March 1, 2012, [[Dial Global]] announced that it would discontinue CNN Radio, and replace it with an expansion of NBC News Radio on April 1, 2012. This marked the first time since Westwood One's purchase of NBC Radio and its properties that NBC would have a 24-hour presence on radio. A previous program, ''First Light'', placed new emphasis on the NBC brand after diminishing it over the years. With the change, NBC News Radio expanded its offerings from 60-second news updates airing only on weekdays to feature two hourly full-length newscasts 24 hours a day. Subsequently, on September 4, 2012, Dial Global launched a sports-talk radio service, [[NBC Sports Radio]].

===Television===

For many years, NBC was closely identified with David Sarnoff, who used it as a vehicle to sell consumer electronics. RCA and Sarnoff had captured the spotlight by introducing all-electronic television to the public at the 1939–40 [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]], simultaneously initiating a regular schedule of programs on the NBC-RCA television station in New York City. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appeared at the fair, before the NBC cameras, becoming the first U.S. president to appear on television on April 30, 1939 ([http://www.davidsarnoff.org/gallery-tv-bw/FDR_TV-WF_39.html an actual, off-the-monitor photograph] of the FDR telecast is available at the David Sarnoff Library). The broadcast was transmitted by NBC's New York television station [[W2XBS]] [[Channel 1 (NTSC-M)|Channel 1]] (later WNBC-TV; now [[WNBC]], channel 4) and was seen by about 1,000 viewers within the station's roughly {{convert|40|mi|km|sing=on}} coverage area from its transmitter at the [[Empire State Building]].

The following day (May 1), four models of RCA television sets went on sale to the general public in various department stores around New York City, which were promoted in a series of splashy newspaper ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=1939 RCA TV sets|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/1939-RCA-Brochure-1.JPG|work=TVHistory.tv}}</ref> [[DuMont Laboratories]] (and others) had actually offered the first home sets in 1938 in anticipation of NBC's announced April 1939 television launch. Later in 1939, NBC took its cameras to professional football and baseball games in the New York City area, establishing many "firsts" in television broadcasting.

Reportedly, the first NBC Television "network" program was broadcast on January 12, 1940, when a play titled ''Meet The Wife'' was originated at the W2XBS studios at Rockefeller Center and rebroadcast by W2XB/W2XAF (now [[WRGB]]) in Schenectady, which received the New York station directly off-air from a tower atop a mountain and relayed the live signal to the [[Capital District]]. About this time, occasional special events were also broadcast in [[Philadelphia]] (over W3XE, later called WPTZ, now known as [[KYW-TV]]) as well as Schenectady. The most ambitious NBC television "network" program of the pre-war era was the telecast of the [[Republican National Convention]] held in Philadelphia in the summer of 1940, which was fed live to the New York City and Schenectady stations.<ref>{{cite web|title=W3XE Broadcasting the 1940 GOP Convention (KYW-TV)|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/40gop.html|work=[[Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]]|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref> However, despite major promotion by RCA, television sales in New York during 1939 and 1940 were disappointing, primarily due to the high cost of the sets, and the lack of compelling regularly schedule programming. Most sets were sold to bars, hotels and other public places, where the general public viewed special sports and news events.

Television's experimental period ended, as the FCC allowed full-fledged commercial television broadcasts to begin on July 1, 1941. NBC station W2XBS in New York City received the first commercial license, adopting the call letters WNBT. The first official, paid television advertisement broadcast by any U.S. station was for watch manufacturer [[Bulova]], which aired that day, just before the start of a [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] baseball telecast on WNBT. The ad consisted of [[test pattern]], featuring the newly assigned WNBT call letters, which was modified to resemble a clock – complete with functioning hands – with the Bulova logo (featuring the phrase "Bulova Watch Time") in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern (a photograph of the NBC camera filming the test pattern-advertisement for that ad can be seen at [http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg this page]). Among the programs that aired during the first week of WNBT's new, commercial schedule was ''The Sunoco News'', a simulcast of the [[Sun Oil]]-sponsored NBC Radio program anchored by [[Lowell Thomas]]; [[Boxing from Jamaica Arena|amateur boxing at Jamaica Arena]]; the Eastern Clay Courts tennis championships; programming from the [[USO]]; the [[spelling bee]]-type game show ''Words on the Wing''; a few feature films; and a one-time-only, test broadcast of the game show ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'', sponsored by [[Lever Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=June 30 WNBT program schedule|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/1941_June_30_WNBT_Program.jpg|work=TVHistory.tv}}</ref>

Prior to the first commercial television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first [[Major League Baseball]] game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and [[Cincinnati Reds]], on August 26, 1939 over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors at the time to have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for [[Ivory Soap]], he held up a bar of the product; for [[Mobil]]gas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel; and for [[Wheaties]] he poured a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Farther Off The Wall|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/2009/08/26/70-years-ago-to/?doing_wp_cron=1362658507.2421700954437255859375|author=Tom Hoffarth|work=InsideSoCal.com|date=August 26, 2009}}</ref>

Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed in the early years of the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia ([[WPTZ]]) and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show ''The Voice of Firestone Televues'', a television offshoot of ''[[The Voice of Firestone]]'', a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows|author=Tim Brooks|author2=Earle F. Marsh|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City}}</ref> The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program.

On [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], May 8, 1945, WNBT broadcast several hours of news coverage, and remotes from around New York City. This event was promoted in advance by NBC with a direct-mail card sent to television set owners in the New York area.<ref>{{cite web|title=1942–1945 TV Program Guides|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv_program_guides2.htm|work=Television History – The First 75 Years|accessdate=March 18, 2008}} Includes a [http://www.tvhistory.tv/1945-Apr-20-VE-DAY-NBC-WNBT.JPG WNBT card mailed to set owners announcing the impending coverage of V-E Day].</ref> At one point, a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the [[Hotel Astor]] panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in [[Europe]]. The vivid coverage was a prelude to television's rapid growth after the war ended.

The NBC television network grew from its initial post-war lineup of four stations. The [[1947 World Series]] featured two New York City area teams (the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] and the Dodgers), and television sales boomed locally, since the games were being telecast in the New York market. Additional stations along the East Coast and in the Midwest were connected by coaxial cable through the late 1940s, and in September 1951 the first transcontinental telecasts took place.

The post-war 1940s and early 1950s brought success for NBC in the new medium. Television's first major star, Milton Berle, whose ''Texaco Star Theatre'' began in June 1948, drew the first large audiences to NBC Television. Under its innovative president, Sylvester "Pat" Weaver, the network launched ''Today'' and ''The Tonight Show'', which would bookend the broadcast day for over 50 years, and which still lead their competitors. Weaver, who also launched the genre of periodic 90-minute network "spectaculars", [[television film|network-produced motion pictures]] and the live 90-minute Sunday afternoon series ''[[Wide Wide World]]'', left the network in 1955 in a dispute with its chairman David Sarnoff, who subsequently named his son Robert Sarnoff as president.

In 1951, NBC commissioned Italian-American composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] to compose the first opera ever written for television; Menotti came up with ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'', a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the [[Three Wise Men]] and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn [[Jesus Christ|Christ Child]]. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched things up, and an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the [[Middle East]], was telecast that year.

====Color television====
{{Main|Color television}}
[[File:Peacock NBC presentation in RCA color.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Title card used by NBC in the 1950s, promoting their color broadcasts.]]
While rivals CBS and the [[DuMont Television Network]] also had plans to begin offering color television broadcasts, RCA convinced the FCC to approve its color system in December 1953. NBC was ready with color programming within days of the Commission's decision. NBC began the transition with a few shows in 1954, and broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color beginning that summer, ''[[The Marriage (television series)|The Marriage]]''.

In 1955, NBC broadcast a live production in color of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', a new [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical adaptation of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s beloved play, on the ''[[Producers' Showcase]]'' anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by [[Mary Martin]] as Peter and [[Cyril Ritchard]] in a dual role as Mr. Darling and [[Captain Hook]]. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It was so successful that NBC restaged it as a live broadcast a mere ten months later; in 1960, long after ''Producers' Showcase'' had ended its run, ''Peter Pan'', with most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone [[television special|special]], and was videotaped so that it would no longer have to be performed live on television.

During a [[National Association of Broadcasters]] meeting in Chicago in 1956, NBC announced that its owned-and-operated station in that market, WNBQ (now [[WMAQ-TV]]), had become the first television station in the country to broadcast its programming in color (airing at least six hours of color broadcasts each day). In 1959, NBC premiered a televised version of the radio program ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]'', which aired in color from its debut; the program would continue on the NBC television network for nine more years until it ended in 1968.

In 1961, NBC approached Walt Disney about acquiring the rights to his [[Walt Disney anthology television series|anthology series]], offering to produce the program in color. Disney was in the midst of negotiating a new contract to keep the program (then known as ''Walt Disney Presents'') on ABC, however ABC president [[Leonard Goldenson]] said that it could not counter the offer, as the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color. Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color''). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC's telecast of the [[1962 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] became the first [[college football]] game ever to be telecast in color.

By 1963, much of NBC's [[prime time]] schedule was presented in color, although some popular series (such as ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', which premiered in late 1964) were broadcast in black-and-white for their entire first season. In the fall of 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color (with the exceptions of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Convoy (TV series)|Convoy]]''), and began billing itself as "The Full Color Network." Without television sets to sell, rival networks followed more slowly, finally committing to an all-color lineup in prime time in the [[1966–67 United States network television schedule|1966–67 season]]. ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' became the first soap opera to premiere in color, when it debuted in November 1965.

NBC contracted with [[Universal Studios]] in 1964 to produce the first feature-length film produced for television, ''[[See How They Run (1964 film)|See How They Run]]'', which first aired on October 17, 1964; its second television movie, ''[[The Hanged Man (1964 film)|The Hanged Man]]'', aired six weeks later on November 28. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The ABC Movie of the Week: Big Movies for the Small Screen|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IVCFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=ABC+Circle+Films&source=bl&ots=WKTIMLSvBK&sig=tBslJiZ7LNP5fkg9JOE8Qn3VFSQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6ODCUoW1KoXqkQfI84DYBw&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=ABC%20Circle%20Films&f=false|author=Michael McKenna|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=XVIII|date=August 22, 2013|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref>

In 1967, NBC reached a deal with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. ''Oz'' had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised ''The Wizard of Oz'' without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like ''Oz'' go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.

The late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As [[baby boomer]]s reached adulthood, NBC, CBS and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years, but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like ''The Bell Telephone Hour'' and ''[[Sing Along With Mitch]]'', which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall were stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society.

====1970s doldrums====
The 1970s started strongly for NBC thanks to hits like ''[[Adam-12]]'', ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. However, despite of the success of such new shows as the ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'', ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[Chico and the Man]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'' and ''[[Emergency!]]'', as well as continued success from veterans like ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', the network entered a slump in the middle of the decade. ''Disney'', in particular, saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put ''[[60 Minutes]]'' up against the program in the Sunday 7:00 p.m. time slot in the [[1975–76 United States network television schedule|1975–76 season]].

In 1974, under new president Herb Schlosser, the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies, [[miniseries]] and specials. This failed to attract the desirable 18–34 demographic, and simultaneously alienated older viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Struggling to Leave the Cellar|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916805,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=May 14, 1979|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref> None of the new prime-time shows that NBC introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season renewal, all failing in the face of established competition. The network's lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late-night comedy/variety show, ''NBC's Saturday Night'' – which would be renamed ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1976, after the cancellation of a [[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell|Howard Cosell-hosted program of the same title]] on ABC – which replaced reruns of ''The Tonight Show'' that previously aired in its Saturday time slot.

In 1978, Schlosser was promoted to executive vice presidency at RCA,<ref>{{cite web|title=Memories of Videodisc – Who's Who in RCA VideoDisc: Herb Schlosser|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/mem/whos-who/schlosser-herbert.html|work=CED Magic|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref> and a desperate NBC lured [[Fred Silverman]] away from top-rated ABC to turn its fortunes around. With the notable exceptions of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and its spin-off ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', ''[[Real People]]'' and the miniseries ''[[Shōgun (TV miniseries)|Shōgun]]'', Silverman was unable to pull out a hit. Failures accumulated rapidly under his watch (such as ''[[Hello, Larry]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', ''[[Pink Lady and Jeff]]'', ''[[The Krofft Superstar Hour]]'' and ''[[The Waverly Wonders]]''). Ironically, many of them were beaten in the ratings by shows that Silverman had greenlit during his previous tenures at CBS and ABC.

During this time, several longtime affiliates also defected from NBC in markets such as [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] ([[WSB-TV]]), [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] ([[WBAL-TV]]), [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] ([[WBRZ-TV]]), [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] ([[WSOC-TV]]), [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] ([[WDTN]]), [[Indianapolis]] ([[WRTV]]), [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] ([[WTLV]]), [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] ([[KSTP-TV]]), [[San Diego]] ([[KGTV]]), Schenectady (WRGB) and [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] ([[WTRF-TV]]). Most were wooed away by ABC, which had lifted out of last place to become the #1 network during the late 1970s and early 1980s, while WBAL-TV, WRGB and WTRF-TV went to CBS. In the case of WSB-TV and WSOC-TV, which have both since become ABC affiliates, both stations were (and remain) under common ownership with [[Cox Enterprises]], with its other NBC affiliate at the time, WIIC-TV in [[Pittsburgh]] (which would become [[WPXI]] in 1981 and also remains owned by Cox), only staying with the network because WIIC-TV itself was in a distant third to CBS-affiliated powerhouse [[KDKA-TV]] and ABC affiliate [[WTAE-TV]] (KDKA-TV, owned at the time by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] and now [[CBS Television Stations|owned by CBS]], infamously passed up affiliating with NBC after [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] bought the station from DuMont in 1954, leading to an acrimonious relationship between NBC and Westinghouse that lasted for years afterward). In markets such as San Diego, Charlotte and Jacksonville, NBC had little choice but to affiliate with a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] station, with the San Diego station ([[KNSD]]) eventually becoming an NBC O&O. In Wheeling, NBC ultimately upgraded its affiliation when it partnered with [[WTOV-TV]] in nearby [[Steubenville, Ohio]], overtaking former affiliate WTRF-TV in the ratings by a large margin. Other smaller television markets like [[Yuma, Arizona]] waited many years to get another local NBC affiliate (first with [[KIVA (TV)|KIVA]], and later [[KYMA-DT|KYMA]]). The stations in Baltimore, Dayton and Jacksonville, however, have since rejoined the network.

After President [[Jimmy Carter]] pulled the U.S. team out of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], NBC canceled a planned 150 hours of coverage (which had cost $87 million for the broadcast rights), placing the network's future in doubt. It had been counting on the broadcasts to help promote its new fall shows, and had been estimated to pull in $170 million in advertising revenue.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC's Retreat From Moscow|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924130-1,00.html|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=May 19, 1980|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

The press was merciless towards Silverman, but the two most savage attacks on his leadership came from within the network. The company that composed the promotional theme for NBC's "[[Proud as a Peacock]]" image campaign created a parody song called "Loud as a Peacock", which was broadcast on [[Don Imus]]' program on WNBC radio in New York played. An angered Silverman ordered all remaining copies of the spoof destroyed, although some copies remain in circulation. ''Saturday Night Live'' writer and occasional performer [[Al Franken]] satirized Silverman in a sketch on the program titled "Limo for a Lame-O". Silverman later admitted he "never liked Al Franken to begin with," and the sketch ruined Franken's chance of succeeding [[Lorne Michaels]] as executive producer of ''SNL'' following his 1981 departure (with the position going to [[Jean Doumanian]], who was fired after one season following declining ratings and negative critical reviews. Michaels would later return to the show in 1985).<ref name="shales">{{cite book|title=Live From New York: An Uncensored History Of Saturday Night Live|author=[[Tom Shales]]|author2=James Andrew Miller|year=2003|publisher=[[Back Bay Books]]|isbn=0-316-73565-5|pages=191–193}}</ref>

====Tartikoff's turnaround====
Fred Silverman resigned as entertainment president in the summer of 1981. [[Grant Tinker]], a highly regarded producer who co-founded [[MTM Enterprises]] with then-wife [[Mary Tyler Moore]], became president of the network and [[Brandon Tartikoff]] became president of the entertainment division. Tartikoff inherited a schedule full of aging dramas and very few sitcoms, but showed patience with promising programs. One such show was the critically acclaimed ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', which suffered from poor ratings during its first season. Rather than canceling the show, he moved it [[Emmy Award]]-winning police drama from [[Steven Bochco]] to Thursdays, where its ratings improved dramatically. He used the same tactics with ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]''. Shows like these were able to get the same ad revenue as their higher-rated competition because of their desirable demographics, upscale adults ages 18–34.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coming Up From Nowhere|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959821-5,00.html|author=[[Richard Corliss]]|work=Time|date=September 16, 1985|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref> While the network claimed moderate successes with ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'', ''[[Silver Spoons]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Remington Steele]]'', its biggest hit during this period was ''[[The A-Team]]'', which, at 10th place, was the network's only program to rank in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] Top-20 for the [[1982–83 United States network television schedule|1982–83 season]], and ascended to third place the following year. These shows helped NBC through the disastrous [[1983–84 United States network television schedule|1983–84 season]], which saw none of its nine new fall shows gaining a second year.<ref>The nine series that premiered in the 1983–84 season were ''Bay City Blues'', ''Boone'', ''For Love and Honor'', ''[[Jennifer Slept Here]]'', ''[[Manimal]]'', ''The Rousters'', ''Mr. Smith'', ''We Got it Made'' and ''The Yellow Rose''.</ref>

In February 1982, NBC canceled [[Tom Snyder]]'s ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' and gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to 34-year-old comedian [[David Letterman]]. Though Letterman was unsuccessful with his [[The David Letterman Show|weekday morning talk show effort]] for the network (which debuted on June 23, 1980), ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' proved much more successful, lasting for 11 years and serving as the launching pad for another [[Late Night (NBC)|late-night talk franchise]] that continues to this day.

In 1984, the huge success of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' led to a renewed interest in sitcoms, while ''[[Family Ties]]'' and ''Cheers'', both of which premiered in 1982 to mediocre ratings (the latter ranking at near dead last among all network shows during the 1982–83 season), saw their viewership increase from having ''Cosby'' as a lead-in. The network rose from third place to second in the ratings during the [[1984–85 United States network television schedule|1984–85 season]] and reached first place in [[1985–86 United States network television schedule|1985–86]], with hits ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'', ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'' and ''[[Hunter (U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]''. The network's upswing continued late into the decade with ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]'', ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[The Hogan Family]]'', ''[[A Different World]]'', ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'' and ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]''. In 1986, [[Bob Wright]] was appointed as chairman of NBC.

In the fall of 1987, NBC conceived a syndication package for its owned-and-operated stations, under the brand "Prime Time Begins at 7:30", consisting of five sitcoms that each aired once a week, and were produced by various production companies contracted by NBC.

The package was aimed at attracting viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]], 7:00&nbsp;p.m. elsewhere),<ref name="Belkin">{{cite news|title=REDEFINING PRIME TIME: IT'S ALL IN WHO YOU ASK|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/11/arts/redefining-prime-time-it-s-all-in-who-you-ask.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=Lisa Belkin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 11, 1987|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Rosenberg"/> and was conceived as a result of the FCC's loosening of the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules]], which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void.<ref name="Belkin"/> The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. ''Marblehead Manor'', ''We Got It Made'' and ''You Can't Take It With You'' were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with ''She's the Sheriff'' lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. ''Out of This World'' ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.

NBC aired the first of seven consecutive [[Summer Olympic Games]] broadcasts when it covered the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Games]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. The [[1988–89 United States network television schedule|1988–89 season]] saw NBC have an astonishing 18 series in Nielsen's year-end Top 30 most-watched network programs; it also ranked at first place in the weekly ratings for more than 12 months, an unprecedented achievement that has not been duplicated since. The network continued its hot streak into the early 1990s with new hits such as ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'' and ''[[Law & Order]]''.

===="Must See TV"====
{{main|Must See TV}}
In 1991, Tartikoff left his role as NBC's President of Entertainment to take an executive position at [[Paramount Pictures]]. In the course of a decade, he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five. Tartikoff was succeeded by [[Warren Littlefield]], whose first years as entertainment president proved shaky as a result of most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. Some blamed Littlefield for losing [[David Letterman]] to CBS after naming [[Jay Leno]] as the successor to [[Johnny Carson]] on ''The Tonight Show'', following the latter's retirement as host in May 1992. Things turned around with the launches of new hit series such as ''[[Mad About You]]'', ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Sisters (TV series)|Sisters]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[Will & Grace]]''.

One of Tartikoff's late acquisitions, ''[[Seinfeld]]'' initially struggled from its debut in 1989 as a summer series, but grew to become one of NBC's top-rated shows after it was moved to Thursdays in the timeslot following ''Cheers''. ''Seinfeld'' ended its run in 1998, becoming the latest overall television program in the U.S. to end its [[series finale|final season]] at the leading rank in the [[Nielsen ratings]] for a single television season. Consequently, ''Friends'' emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 ''Seinfeld'' final broadcast. It dominated the ratings, never leaving the top five watched shows of the year from its second through tenth seasons and landing on the number-one spot during season eight in the [[2001–02 United States network television schedule|2001–02 season]] as the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings. ''Cheers'' spinoff ''Frasier'' became a critical and commercial success, usually landing in the Nielsen Top 20 – although its ratings were overshadowed to a minor extent by ''Friends'' – and went on to win numerous Emmy Awards (eventually setting a record for a sitcom that lasted until it was overtaken by ''[[Modern Family]]'' in 2014). In 1994, the network began branding its strong Thursday night lineup, mainly in reference to the comedies airing in the first two hours, under the "Must See TV" tagline (which during the mid- and late 1990s, was also applied to NBC's comedy blocks on other nights, particularly on Tuesdays).

By the mid-1990s, [[NBC Sports|NBC's sports division]], headed by [[Dick Ebersol]], had rights to three of the four major professional sports leagues (the [[NFL on NBC|NFL]], [[Major League Baseball on NBC|Major League Baseball]] and the [[NBA on NBC|NBA]]), the Olympics, and the national powerhouse [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football]] team. The ''NBA on NBC'' enjoyed great success in the 1990s due in large part to the [[Chicago Bulls]]' run of six championships at the hands of superstar [[Michael Jordan]]. However, NBC Sports would suffer a major blow in 1998, when it lost the rights to the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) to [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], which itself had lost rights to the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) to [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] four years earlier;<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|author=Milton Kent|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref> the deal stripped NBC of [[National Football League]] (NFL) game telecasts after 59 years and AFC games after 36 years (dating back to its existence as the [[American Football League]] prior to its [[AFL-NFL merger|1970 merger]] with the NFL).

Littlefield left NBC in 1998 to pursue a career as a television and film producer,<ref>{{cite news|title=It's Production for Littlefield|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-10-27/entertainment/18084019_1_warren-littlefield-nbc-west-coast-peacock-network|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=October 27, 1998|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> with the network subsequently going through three entertainment presidents in three years. Littlefield was replaced as president of NBC Entertainment by [[Scott Sassa]], who oversaw the development of such shows as ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' and ''[[Fear Factor]]''. After Sassa was reassigned to NBC's West Coast Division, [[Garth Ancier]] was named as his replacement in 1999.<ref name="Sassa">{{cite news|title=NBC to Make West Coast Executive an Adviser|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/22/business/nbc-to-make-west-coast-executive-an-adviser.html?ref=scottmsassa|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 22, 2002|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Jeff Zucker]] then succeeded Ancier as president of NBC Entertainment in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC: Adios, Ancier.

====New century, new problems====
At the start of the 2000s, NBC's fortunes started to take a rapid turn for the worse. The network had already lost many viewers in the late 1990s who boycotted NBC and its programming after the cancellation of the long-running soap opera ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' in 1999. That year, CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of ''Friends'', ''Will & Grace'', ''ER'' and ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the [[2000–01 United States network television schedule|2000–01 season]]) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Overall, NBC retook its first place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the [[2002–03 United States network television schedule|2002–03 season]], when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.

On the other hand, NBC was stripped of the broadcast rights to two other major sports leagues: it lost Major League Baseball to [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] after the [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000 season]] (by that point, NBC only had alternating rights to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], [[League Championship Series]] and [[World Series]]); and, later, the NBA to [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] after the [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02 season]]. After losing the NBA rights, NBC's major sports offerings were reduced to the Olympics (which in [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], expanded to include rights to the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]], as part of a contract that gave it the U.S. television rights to both the Summer and Winter Olympics through [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]), [[Golf Channel on NBC|PGA Tour]] golf events and a floundering Notre Dame football program.

In October 2001, NBC acquired Spanish-language network [[Telemundo]] from [[Liberty Media]] and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] for $2.7 billion, beating out other bidders including CBS/[[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. The deal was finalized in 2002.<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|title=NBC tacks on Telemundo oversight to Gaspin's tasks|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/business/la-fi-gaspin26jul26,1,4482109.story?coll=la-headlines-business-enter|author=Meg James|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 26, 2007|accessdate=May 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBC pays $2.7bn for Telemundo|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/14751/NBC-pays--27bn-Telemundo/www.nbc.com|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=[[Marketing Magazine]]|date=October 12, 2001}}</ref>

In 2003, French entertainment conglomerate [[Vivendi]] acquired a 49% interest in NBC from General Electric, integrating the company with Vivendi's various film, television and amusement properties (including Universal Pictures), under the integrated NBC Universal. In 2004, Zucker was promoted to the newly created position of president of NBC Universal Television Group. [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]] became the new president of NBC Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox's Kevin Reilly Upped To Chairman of Entertainment|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/foxs-kevin-reilly-upped-to-chairman-of-entertainment/|author=Nellie Andreeva|work=Deadline.com|date=August 20, 2012|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

After ''Friends'' and ''Frasier'' both ended their runs in 2004, NBC was left with several moderately rated shows and few true hits.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Longer 'Must-See TV'|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303864404575572313787373070|author=Sam Schechner|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=October 25, 2010|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> In particular, ''Friends'' spin-off ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', despite a relatively strong start, started to falter in the ratings during its second season. The [[2004–05 United States network television schedule|2004–05 season]] saw NBC become the first major network to air select dramas in [[letterboxing (filming)|letterbox]] over its analog broadcast feed; the move was done in the hopes of attracting new viewers, although the network saw only a slight boost.

In December 2005, NBC began its first week-long primetime game show event, ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'''; the series garnered high ratings, and returning as a weekly series in March 2006. Otherwise, the [[2005–06 United States network television schedule|2005–06]] season was one of the worst for NBC in three decades, with only one fall series, the sitcom ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'', surviving for a second season; the sole remaining anchor of the "Must See TV" lineup, ''Will & Grace'' also saw its ratings decline. That season, NBC's ratings freefalled to fourth place, behind a resurgent ABC, Fox (which would eventually become the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the 2007–08 season) and top-rated CBS (which led for much of the remainder of the decade). During this time, all of the networks faced audience erosion from increased competition by [[cable television]], [[home video]], [[video game]]s and the [[Internet]], with NBC being the hardest hit.

The [[2006–07 United States network television schedule|2006–07 season]] was a mixed bag for the network, with ''Deal or No Deal'' remaining strong and ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights, while the highly touted ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' (from ''West Wing'' creator [[Aaron Sorkin]]) lost a third of its premiere-night viewers by Week 6 and was eventually cancelled; two critically acclaimed sitcoms, ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]'', also pulled in modest successes and went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years. The network also regained the rights to the NFL after eight years that season when it acquired the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' package from [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN]] (as part of a deal that also saw ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' move to ESPN from ABC). However, despite this, NBC remained at a very distant fourth place, barely ranking ahead of [[The CW]].

However, NBC did experience success with its summer schedule, despite its declining ratings during the main broadcast season. ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', a reality talent competition series that premiered in 2006, earned a 4.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, higher than that earned by the 2002 premiere of Fox's ''[[American Idol]]''. ''Got Talent'' (which is the flagship of a [[Got Talent|international talent competition franchise]]) would continue to garner unusually high ratings throughout its summer run. However, NBC decided not to place it in the spring season, and instead use it as a platform to promote their upcoming fall shows. Originally hosted by [[Regis Philbin]], {{as of|2013|lc=y}} the series is currently hosted by [[Nick Cannon]], and continues to garner strong ratings throughout its summer seasons. In March 2007, NBC announced that it would begin offering full-length episodes of its prime time series for [[streaming media|streaming]] on mobile devices, becoming the first U.S. broadcast network to offer on-demand mobile episode content, as the market began shifting away from traditional television.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/155802.shtml|title=NBC to Offer On-Demand Mobile TV Service|publisher=[[NewsMax Media]]|date=March 14, 2007 |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

Following the unexpected termination of Kevin Reilly, in 2007, [[Ben Silverman]] was appoined president of NBC Entertainment,<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC SHAKE-UP UPDATE: Kevin Reilly Officially Out.

The network failed to generate any new primetime hits emerged during the [[2008–09 United States network television schedule|2008–09 season]] (despite the rare good fortune of having the rights to both the [[Super Bowl XLIII|Super Bowl]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in which to promote their new programming slate), while ''Heroes'' and ''Deal or No Deal'' both collapsed in the ratings and were later cancelled (with a revamped ''Deal or No Deal'' being revived for one additional season in syndication). In a March 2009 interview, Zucker had stated that he no longer believed it would be possible for NBC to become #1 in prime time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zucker Weighs In On Leno, NBC's Future|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=102392|author=David Goetzl|work=Media Daily News|date=March 18, 2009|accessdate=April 19, 2009}}</ref> Ben Silverman left the network in 2009, with [[Jeff Gaspin]] replacing him as president of NBC Entertainment.

The network's planned late night realignment led a disgruntled O'Brien, who gained tremendous support from viewers and entertainers as a result of the implications, to [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|enter negotiations to terminate his contract with NBC]]. Leno, Zucker and NBC as a whole experienced considerable public backlash against them for their involvement. Leno would end up returning as host of ''The Tonight Show'' on March 1, 2010, while O'Brien accepted a buyout from his contract. O'Brien later signed a deal with cable network [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] to host a new talk show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', which debuted in November 2010.

The removal of ''The Jay Leno Show'' from its prime time schedule had almost no impact on the network's ratings. The increases NBC experienced in the [[2010–11 United States network television schedule|2010–11 season]] compared to [[2009–10 United States network television schedule|2009–10]] were almost entirely attributable to the rising viewership of ''NBC Sunday Night Football''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thanks To The Football Gods, NBC Is Ahead Of Last Season's Ratings|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/01/05/thanks-to-the-football-gods-nbc-is-ahead-of-last-seasons-ratings/77351|author=Bill Gorman|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=January 5, 2011}}</ref> By 2012, the shows that occupied the 10:00 p.m. time slot drew lower numbers than ''The Jay Leno Show'' did when it aired in that hour two years before.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ouch!

Otherwise, NBC had another tough season, with the midseason legal drama ''[[Harry's Law]]'' being its only freshman scripted series to be renewed for the [[2011–12 United States network television schedule|2011–12 season]]. The network nearly completed its full conversion to an all-HD schedule (outside of the Saturday morning timeslot leased by the [[Qubo]] consortium, which NBCUniversal would rescind its stake in the following year) on September 20, 2011, when ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' converted to the format with the premiere of its 11th season.

Buoyed by its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVI]] (which became the most-watched program in U.S. television history at the time) and the success of its Monday night midseason lineup of ''The Voice'' and musical-drama ''[[Smash (TV series)|Smash]]'', the network managed to lift itself into third place in the 18-49 demographic in the 2011–12 season, breaking the network's eight-year streak in fourth place. NBC experienced better fortunes overall with that season's schedule, as several shows survived for a second season, although none were unqualified ratings successes. The network completed its conversion to high definition in September 2012, with the launch of [[NBC Kids]], a new Saturday morning children's block programmed by new partial sister network [[Sprout (TV network)|PBS Kids Sprout]], which also became the second Saturday morning children's block with an entirely HD schedule (after the ABC-syndicated ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]'').

In the fall of 2012, NBC greatly expanded its sitcom roster, with eight comedy series airing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. NBC bounced back to first place network in adults 18-49 that fall, boosted by the new season of ''The Voice'', the initial success of freshman drama ''[[Revolution (TV series)|Revolution]]'' and sitcom ''[[Go On (TV series)|Go On]]'', and the continued strength of ''Sunday Night Football''. However, withholding the new season of ''The Voice'' and benching ''Revolution'' until late March, the network's midseason ratings suffered, falling to fifth place behind Spanish-language network [[Univision]] during the February [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps period]].<ref>{{cite web|title=In Turnabout, NBC Prime Time Lands in the Cellar|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/nbcs-ratings-plummet-from-first-to-worst.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0&smid=tw-share|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> The [[2012–13 United States network television schedule|2012–13 season]] ended with NBC finishing in third place overall,<ref>{{cite news|title=2012-2013 Season: NBC Leads Among Adults 18-49, While CBS is Number 1 with Total Viewers Through Week 16 Ending January 13, 2013|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/01/15/2012-2013-season-nbc-leads-among-adults-18-49-while-cbs-is-number-1-with-total-viewers-through-week-15-ending-january-13-2013/165327/|author=Amanda Kondolojy|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2012-2013 Season Network Rankings: CBS Sweeps In Final Numbers; ABC, CBS & Fox Tie In May Sweep|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/network-tv-final-rankings-2012-2013-season-full-list/|author=Dominic Patten|work=Deadline.com|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> albeit by a narrow margin, with only three new shows, all dramas, surviving for a second season (''Revolution'', ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' and ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'').

In 2013, NBC Sports migrated its business and production operations (including [[NBCSN]]) to new facilities in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC to air MLS marathon in new digs|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2013/03/12/nbc-nhl-olympics-major-league-soccer/1983139/|author=Michael Heistand|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=March 12, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> Production of the network's NFL [[pre-game show]] ''[[Football Night in America]]'' remained at the [[NBC Studios (New York)#NBC Studio productions|NBC Studios]] at Rockefeller Center (with production operations based in Studio 8G, while the program itself was broadcast in Studio 8H, the longtime home of ''Saturday Night Live''), until it migrated to the Stamford facility in September 2014.

Despite the failure of another highly-advertised game show event, ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14 season]] was mostly successful for NBC due to the continued success of ''The Voice'', ''Chicago Fire'', ''Revolution'', ''Sunday Night Football'' and ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]''. Along with new hits including ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' and ''[[Chicago PD (TV series)|Chicago PD]]'' and a significant ratings boost from its broadcast of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], NBC became the #1 network in the coveted 18-49 demographic that season for the first time since 2003–04. NBC also improved considerably in total viewership, finishing behind CBS in second place for the season.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC Tops Week 3 of 2013-14 Primetime Season for 18-49|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2014/05/20/nbc-wins-the-2013-14-september-to-may-primetime-television-season-702212/20140520nbc04/|work=The Futon Critic|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by NBC|List of programs previously broadcast by NBC}}
{{As of|2013}}, NBC provides 87 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturdays from 8:00–11:00&nbsp;p.m. (7:00–10:00&nbsp;p.m. in all other U.S. time zones) and Sundays from 7:00–11:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (6:00–10:00&nbsp;p.m. in all other time zones).

Daytime programming is also provided weekdays between 12:00 and 3:00&nbsp;p.m. in the form of the one-hour weekday soap opera ''Days of Our Lives'' (the scheduling of the program varies depending on the station, although it is initially fed to affiliates at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern). [[NBC News]] programming includes the morning news/interview program ''Today'' from 7:00–11:00 a.m. weekdays, 7:00–9:00 on Saturdays and 7:00–8:00 on Sundays; nightly editions of ''NBC Nightly News'' (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday political talk show]] ''[[Meet the Press]]'', weekday early-morning news program ''[[Early Today]]'' and newsmagazine ''[[Dateline NBC]]''. Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'' and ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', weeknight replays of the fourth hour of ''Today'' and [[CNBC]] program ''[[Mad Money]]'', and the sketch comedy show ''Saturday Night Live'', and the [[LXTV]]-produced ''1st Look'' and ''Open House NYC'' on Saturdays (replays of the previous week's ''1st Look'' also air on Friday late nights on most stations).

The network's Saturday morning children's programming timeslot is programmed by sister cable channel [[Sprout (TV network)|Sprout]], which produces the three-hour live-action/animation block for preschoolers, [[NBC Kids]], under a time-lease agreement.

Sports programming is also provided weekend afternoons at any time between 12:00 and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. (9:00&nbsp;a.m.-3:00&nbsp;p.m., or [[Broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] in the Pacific Time Zone). Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, NBC will occasionally pre-empt scheduled programs (more common with the weekend editions of ''NBC Nightly News'', and local and syndicated programs carried by its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates).

===NBC News===
[[File:NBC News Washington.jpg|thumb|NBC News Washington Bureau.]]
{{Main|NBC News}}
News coverage has long been an important part of NBC's operations and public image, dating to the network's radio days. Notable NBC News productions past and present include ''Today'', ''NBC Nightly News'' (and its immediate predecessor, the ''[[Huntley-Brinkley Report]]''), ''Meet the Press'' (which has the distinction of the longest continuously running program in the history of American television), ''Dateline NBC'', ''Early Today'', ''[[NBC News at Sunrise]]'', ''[[NBC Nightside]]'' and ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams]]''.

In 1989, the news division began its expansion to cable with the launch of business news channel CNBC. The company eventually formed other [[United States cable news|cable news]] services including MSNBC (created in 1996 originally as a joint venture with [[Microsoft]], which now features a mix of general news and political discussion programs with a liberal stance),<ref name="Auto8E-8">{{cite news|title=Study: NBC News Doesn't Follow MSNBC's Partisan Drift|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/30/study-nbc-news-doesnt-fol_n_139162.html|author=David Bauder|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Auto8E-9">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39507182/ns/business-media_biz/|title=MSNBC to 'lean forward' in a two year brand campaign|publisher=NBC|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}</ref> and the 2008 acquisition of the [[The Weather Channel]] in conjunction with [[Blackstone Group]] and [[Bain Capital]]. In addition, [[NBCSN]] (operated as part of the NBC Sports Group, and which became an NBC property through Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal) carries sports news content alongside sports event telecasts. Key anchors from NBC News are also used during NBC Sports coverage of the Olympic Games.

===Daytime programming===
{{main|NBC Daytime}}
NBC is currently the home to only one daytime program, the hour-long soap opera ''Days of Our Lives'', which has been broadcast on the network since 1965. Since NBC turned over an hour of its then two-hour daytime schedule back to its affiliates as a result of the September 2007 expansion of ''Today'' to four hours, the network currently ties with The CW for the fewest daytime programming hours of any major broadcast television network.

Long-running daytime dramas seen on NBC in the past include ''[[The Doctors (1963 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' (1963–1982), ''Another World'' (1964–1999), ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' (1984–1993), and ''[[Passions]]'' (1999–2007, later moving to [[Audience Network|The 101]]). NBC also aired the final 4½ years of ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' (1982–1986) after that series was initially cancelled by CBS, although many NBC affiliates did not clear the show during its tenure on the network. NBC has also aired numerous short-lived soaps, including ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' (1989–1991), ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]'' (1997–1999), and the two ''Another World'' spin-offs, ''[[Somerset (TV series)|Somerset]]'' (1970–1976) and ''[[Texas (TV series)|Texas]]'' (1980–1982).

Notable daytime game shows that once aired on NBC include ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' (1956–1963), ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]'' (1958–1973 and 1987–1991 as ''Classic Concentration''), ''[[Match Game|The Match Game]]'' (1962–1969), ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' (1963–1968 and 1990–1991, as well as a short-lived primetime revival in 2002), ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' (1964–1975 and 1978–1979), ''The Hollywood Squares'' (1966–1980), ''Wheel of Fortune'' (1975–1989 and 1991), ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Password Plus/Super Password]]'' (1979–1982 and 1984–1989), ''[[Sale of the Century (US game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1969–1973 and 1983–1989) and ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]'' (1984–1990 and 1993). The last game show ever to air as part of NBC's daytime schedule was the short-lived ''[[Caesars Challenge]]'', which ended in January 1994.

Notable past daytime talk shows that have aired on NBC have included ''[[Home (1954 TV series)|Home]]'' (1954–1957), ''[[The Ernie Kovacs Show]]'' (1955–1956), ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' (1962–1963), ''[[Leeza]]'' (1994–1999) and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)#Later Today|Later Today]]'' (1999–2000).

===Children's programming===
{{Main|Children's programming on NBC|TNBC|Discovery Kids on NBC|qubo|NBC Kids}}
Children's programming has played a part in NBC's programming since its initial roots in television. NBC's first major children's series, ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', which debuted in 1947 and was one of the era's first breakthrough television shows. Running for 13 years and hosted by [[Buffalo Bob Smith|"Buffalo" Bob Smith]], the series featured a freckle-faced [[marionette]] and a myriad of other characters. ''Howdy Doody'' spent most of its run on weekday afternoons until 1956, when NBC relegated its children's programming exclusively to Saturday mornings with ''Howdy Doody'' serving as its marquee franchise for the series' remaining four years.

From the mid-1960s until 1992, the bulk of NBC's children's programming was derived of mainly animated programming including classic ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'' shorts; reruns of primetime animated sitcoms such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]''; foreign acquisitions like ''[[Astro Boy]]'' and ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''; animated adaptions of ''[[Punky Brewster]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' and ''[[Star Trek]]'' as well as animated vehicles for [[Gary Coleman]] and [[Mr. T]]; live-action programs like ''[[The Banana Splits]]'', ''[[The Bugaloos]]'' and ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]''; and the original broadcasts of ''[[Gumby]]'', ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'' and ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]''. From 1984 to 1989, the network aired a series of [[public service announcement]]s called ''[[One to Grow On]]'', which aired after the end credits of every program or every other children's program.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1986 Saturday Morning Lineup on NBC|url=http://www.retroist.com/2009/03/20/the-1986-saturday-morning-lineup-on-nbc/|work=[[The Retroist]]|date=March 20, 2009|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

In 1989, NBC premiered ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', a live-action [[teen sitcom]] which originated on [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] the previous year as ''[[Good Morning, Miss Bliss]]'' (which served as a starring vehicle for [[Hayley Mills]]; [[Mark-Paul Gosselaar|four]] [[Dennis Haskins|cast members]] [[Lark Voorhies|from]] [[Dustin Diamond|that show]] were cast in the NBC series as the characters they originally played on ''Miss Bliss''). ''Saved by the Bell'', despite being given bad reviews from television critics, would become one of the most popular teen series in television history as well as the top-rated series on Saturday mornings, dethroning ABC's ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]'' in its first season.

The success of ''Saved by the Bell'' led NBC to remove animated series from its Saturday morning lineup in August 1992 in favor of additional live-action series as part of a new block called [[TNBC]], along with the debut of a Saturday edition of ''[[Weekend Today|Today]]''. Most of the series featured on the TNBC lineup were executive produced by [[Peter Engel (TV producer)|Peter Engel]] (such as ''[[City Guys]]'', ''[[Hang Time (TV series)|Hang Time]]'', ''[[California Dreams]]'', ''[[One World (TV series)|One World]]'' and the ''Saved by the Bell'' spinoff, ''[[Saved by the Bell: The New Class]]''), with the lineup being designed from the start to meet the earliest form of the FCC's [[E/I|educational programming guidelines]] under the [[Children's Television Act]].<ref name="DiscoveryKids">{{cite news|title=Discovery set to kid around with Peacock|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117856766.html?categoryid=1201&cs=1&query=|author=Paula Bernstein|work=Variety|date=December 4, 2001|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> ''NBA Inside Stuff'', an analysis and interview program aimed at teens that was hosted for most of its run by [[Ahmad Rashad]], was also a part of the TNBC lineup during the NBA season until 2002 (when the program moved to ABC as a result of that network taking the NBA rights from NBC).

In 2002, NBC entered into an agreement with [[Discovery Communications]] to carry educational children's programs from the [[Discovery Kids]] cable channel.<ref name="DiscoveryKids"/> Debuting that September, the [[Discovery Kids on NBC]] block originally consisted exclusively of live-action series, including reality series ''Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls'' (a kid-themed version of the [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] series ''[[Trading Spaces]]''); the Emmy-nominated reality game show ''[[Endurance (TV series)|Endurance]]'', hosted and produced by [[J. D. Roth]] (whose production company, 3-Ball Productions, would also produce reality series ''[[The Biggest Loser (U.S. TV series)|The Biggest Loser]]'' for NBC beginning in 2003); and scripted series such as ''[[Strange Days at Blake Holsey High]]'' and ''[[Scout's Safari]]''. The block later expanded to include some animated series such as ''[[Kenny the Shark]]'', ''[[Tutenstein]]'' and ''[[Time Warp Trio]]''.

In May 2006, NBC announced plans to launch a new Saturday morning children's block under the [[Qubo]] brand in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Discovery, NBC to End Sat.

Qubo launched on NBC on September 9, 2006 with six programs (''[[VeggieTales]]'', ''[[Dragon (TV series)|Dragon]]'', ''VeggieTales Presents: [[3-2-1 Penguins!]]'', ''[[Babar (TV series)|Babar]]'', ''[[Jane and the Dragon (TV series)|Jane and the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Jacob Two-Two (TV series)|Jacob Two-Two]]'').

On March 28, 2012, it was announced that NBC would launch a new Saturday morning preschool block programmed by PBS Kids Sprout (originally jointly owned by NBCUniversal, [[PBS]], [[Sesame Workshop]] and [[Apax Partners]], with the former acquiring the other's interests later that year). The block, [[NBC Kids]], premiered on July 7, 2012, replacing the "Qubo on NBC" block.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NBC Will Launch NBC Kids, a New Saturday Morning Preschool Block Programmed by Sprout®, Saturday, July 7|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nbc-will-launch-nbc-kids-a-new-saturday-morning-preschool-block-programmed-by-sprout-saturday-july-7-2012-03-28|newspaper=[[MarketWatch]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBC to launch Saturday kids block|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052022?refCatId=14|author=Jon Weisman|newspaper=Variety|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBC, With Assist From Sprout, to Launch Saturday Morning Preschool Block|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/482478-NBC_With_Assist_From_Sprout_to_Launch_Saturday_Morning_Preschool_Block.php|author=Lindsay Rubino|newspaper=Multichannel News|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Launches Preschool Saturday Block Programmed By Sprout|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/nbc-launches-preschool-saturday-block-programmed-by-sprout/|author=Nellie Andreeva|work=Deadline.com|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Specials===
NBC holds the broadcast rights to several annual specials and award show telecasts including the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, the [[Emmy Award]]s (which is rotated across all four major networks each year), and two of the three pageants organized by the [[Miss Universe Organization]]: the [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss USA]] pageants (NBC also held rights to the [[Miss Teen USA]] pageant from 2003, when NBC also assumed rights to the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants as part of a deal brokered by Miss Universe Organization owner [[Donald Trump]] that gave the network half-ownership of the pageants,<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump moves pageants from CBS to NBC|publisher=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|page=2B|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> until 2007, when NBC declined to renew its contract to carry Miss Teen USA, effectively discontinuing televised broadcasts of that event).

Since 1952, NBC has served as the official U.S. broadcaster of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. CBS also carries unauthorized coverage of the Macy's parade as part of ''The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS''; However as NBC holds rights to the parade, it has exclusivity over the broadcast of Broadway and music performances appearing in the parade (CBS airs pre-recorded performances separate from those seen in the parade as a result), and Macy's chose to reroute the parade in 2012 out of the view of CBS' cameras, although it continues to cover the parade. NBC began airing a same-day rebroadcast of the parade telecast in 2009 (replacing its annual Thanksgiving afternoon airing of ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]''). In 2007, NBC acquired the rights to the [[National Dog Show]], which airs following the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade each year.

The network also broadcasts several live-action and animated specials during the [[Christmas holiday season]], including the 2014 debuts ''[[How Murray Saved Christmas]]'' (an animated musical adaptation of the children's book of the same name) and ''[[Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas]]'' (a stop-motion animated specials based on the 2003 live-action film ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]''.

===Programming library===
Through the years, NBC has produced many in-house programs, in addition to airing content from other producers such as Revue Studios and its successor Universal Television. Notable in-house productions by NBC have included ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''Little House on the Prairie'', ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'' and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]''.

NBC sold the distribution rights to programs it produced prior up to that year to [[National Telefilm Associates]] in 1973; those rights are currently owned by [[CBS Television Distribution]], although NBC still owns the copyrights to the episodes. As a result, NBC, in a way, now owns several other series aired on the network prior to 1973, such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. NBC continues to own its entire library of programs produced after 1973, through corporate sister [[NBCUniversal Television Group]] (the successor to Universal Television).

==Stations==
{{Main|List of NBC television affiliates (by U.S. state)|List of NBC television affiliates (table)|NBC Owned Television Stations}}
{{As of|March 2015}}, NBC has eleven owned-and-operated stations and current and pending affiliation agreements with 221 additional television stations encompassing 48 states, the District of Columbia, six U.S. possessions and two non-U.S. territories ([[Aruba]] and [[Greenland]]).<ref name=re>{{cite web|title=Stations for Network - NBC|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=NBC|work=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name="StationIndex">{{cite web|title=Network Profile: NBC|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/nbc|publisher=Station Index}}</ref> The network has a national reach of 95.92% of all households in the United States (or 299,732,600 Americans with at least one television set).

Currently, [[New Hampshire]] and [[New Jersey]] are the only U.S. states where NBC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Hampshire is served by [[Boston]] affiliate [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] and [[Hartford, Vermont]] affiliate [[WNNE]], while New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WNBC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WCAU; New Jersey formerly had an in-state affiliate in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]-based [[WMGM-TV]], which was affiliated with the network from 1955 to 2014). NBC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few smaller markets, such as [[Binghamton, New York]] ([[WBGH-CA]]), [[Jackson, Tennessee]] ([[WNBJ-LD]]) and [[Juneau, Alaska]] ([[KATH-LD]]), that do not have enough full-power stations to support a standalone affiliate. In some markets, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.

Currently outside of the [[NBC Owned Television Stations]]-operated O&O group, the [[Gannett Company]] is the largest operator of NBC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning or providing services to 20 NBC affiliates (including those in larger markets such as [[KUSA (TV)|Denver]], [[KSDK|St. Louis]], [[KING-TV|Seattle]] and [[WKYC-TV|Cleveland]]); [[Gray Television]] is the largest operator of NBC stations by numerical total, owning 23 NBC-affiliated stations.

==NBCi==
[[File:NBCi.jpeg|thumb|right|600px|NBCi header used from 1999 to 2007.]]
In 1999, NBC launched NBCi (briefly changing its web address to "www.nbci.com"), a heavily advertised online venture serving as an attempt to launch an [[Internet portal]] and [[homepage]]. This move saw NBC partner with [[Xoom (web hosting)|XOOM.com]], e-mail.com, [[AllBusiness.com]],<ref>{{cite news|title=NBCi agrees to acquire AllBusiness.com|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1017-236384.html|work=[[CNET Networks|CNET News]]|date=February 1, 2000|accessdate=March 25, 2008|archiveurl=http://archive.is/IcHQ|archivedate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> and Snap.com (eventually acquiring all four companies outright) to launch a multi-faceted internet portal with e-mail, webhosting, community, chat and personalization capabilities, and news content. Subsequently in April 2000, NBC purchased GlobalBrain, a company specializing in [[search engine]]s that learned from searches initiated by its users, for $32 million.

The experiment lasted roughly one season; after its failure, NBCi's operations were folded back into NBC.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC to take NBCi back in-house|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1017-236384.html|work=[[CNET Networks|CNET News]]|date=April 9, 2001|accessdate=March 25, 2008|archiveurl=http://archive.is/IcHQ|archivedate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> The NBC Television portion of the website reverted to NBC.com. However, the NBCi website continued in operation as a portal for NBC-branded content (NBCi.com would be redirected to NBCi.msnbc.com), using a co-branded version of [[InfoSpace]] to deliver minimal portal content. In mid-2007, NBCi.com began to mirror the main NBC.com website;<ref>{{cite web|title=Archives of http://NBCi.com|url=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://NBCi.com|work=Wayback Machine |publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=March 15, 2008}}</ref> NBCi.com was eventually redirected to the NBC.com domain in 2010.

==Evolution of the NBC logo==
{{Main|Logo of NBC}}
NBC has used a number of logos throughout its history; early logos used by the television and radio networks were similar to the logo of its then parent company, RCA. Logos used later in NBC's existence incorporated stylized [[Peafowl|peacock]] designs, including the current version that has been in use since 1986.

==International broadcasts==
===Canada===
NBC network programs can be received throughout most of [[Canada]] on cable, satellite and [[IPTV]] providers through certain U.S.-based affiliates of the network (such as WHDH/Boston, [[KING-TV]]/Seattle, [[KBJR-TV]]/[[Duluth, Minnesota]], [[WGRZ]]/[[Buffalo, New York]] and [[WDIV-TV]]/[[Detroit]]). Some programs carried on these stations are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]]s, a practice imposed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue. Some of these affiliates are also receivable over-the-air in southern areas of the country located near the [[Canada–United States border]] (signal coverage was somewhat reduced after the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition in 2009]] due to the lower radiated power required to transmit digital signals).

===Europe and the Middle East===
{{update|section|date=April 2010}}
NBC no longer exists outside the Americas as a channel in its own right. However, NBC News and MSNBC programs are broadcast for a few hours a day on [[Orbit News]] in Europe, [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. Sister network [[CNBC Europe]] also broadcasts occasional breaking news coverage from MSNBC as well as ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' (until 2010, the channel formerly broadcast daily airings of ''NBC Nightly News'').<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC Now airing 1 hr episodes of Tonight|url=http://www.lateshowuk.com/shows/tonight-show/6323/cnbc-now-airing-1-hr-episodes-of-tonight|publisher=Late Show UK|date=April 24, 2010|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

====NBC Super Channel becomes NBC Europe====
In 1993, then-NBC parent General Electric acquired Super Channel, relaunching the Pan-European cable network as NBC Super Channel.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Buys Into Pan-European Super Channel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-02/business/fi-41359_1_super-channel|author=John Lippman|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 2, 1993|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> In 1996, the channel was renamed [[NBC Europe]], but was, from then on, almost always referred to on-air as simply "NBC".

Most of NBC Europe's prime time programming was produced in Europe due to rights restrictions associated with U.S. primetime shows; the channel's weekday late night schedule after 11:00 p.m. [[Central European Time]], however, featured ''The Tonight Show'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]'', which the channel's slogan "Where the Stars Come Out at Night" was based around. Many NBC News programs were broadcast on NBC Europe, including ''Dateline NBC'', ''Meet the Press'' and ''NBC Nightly News'', the latter of which was broadcast simultaneously with the initial U.S. telecast. ''Today'' was also initially aired live in the afternoons, but was later broadcast instead the following morning on a more than half-day delay.

In 1999, NBC Europe ceased broadcasting in most of Europe outside of Germany; the network was concurrently relaunched as a German-language technology channel aimed at a younger demographic, with the new series ''NBC GIGA'' as its flagship program. In 2005, the channel was relaunched again as the [[free-to-air]] movie channel [[Das Vierte]]. [[GIGA Television]] was subsequently spun off as a separate digital channel, available on satellite and cable providers in Germany, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
====Mexico====
NBC programming is available in [[Mexico]] through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the [[Mexico–United States border]] (such as [[KYMA-DT]]/[[Yuma, Arizona]]; [[KGNS-TV]]/[[Laredo, Texas]]; [[KTSM-TV|KTSM]]/[[El Paso, Texas]]; [[KVEO]]/[[Brownsville, Texas]]; and [[KNSD]]/[[San Diego]]), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico. Some U.S.-based border affiliates are also available on domestic cable and satellite providers throughout the country, including in the [[Mexico City]] area.

====Canal de Noticias====
In 1993, NBC launched a 24-hour Spanish language news channel serving [[Latin America]] (the second news channel serving that region overall, after [[Noticias ECO]], and the first to broadcast 24 hours a day), Canal de Noticias NBC, which based its news schedule around the "wheel" format conceived at CNN.<ref>{{cite book|title=Latinos and American Popular Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nW6jAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Launching+of+Canal+de+Noticias+of+NBC+in+1993&source=bl&ots=lVjFhpWdFv&sig=mdo5LQM6B1USj5KdMkPAzGqDI48&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2jnnUvrgHOGW2QX1uoCgDQ&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Launching%20of%20Canal%20de%20Noticias%20of%20NBC%20in%201993&f=false|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|page=54|year=2013}}</ref> The channel, which was headquartered out of the offices of the NBC News Channel affiliate news service in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], employed over 50 journalists to produce, write, anchor and provide technical services. Canal de Noticias NBC shut down in 1997 due to the channel's inability to generate substainable advertising revenue.

====Caribbean====
In the [[Caribbean]], many cable and satellite providers carry either select U.S.-based NBC affiliated stations or the main network feed from NBC O&Os WNBC in New York City or [[WTVJ]] in Miami. In addition, the network's programming has been available in the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] since 2004 on [[WVGN-LD]] in [[Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]] (owned by LKK Group), while Telemundo owned-and-operated station [[WKAQ-TV]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] carries the WNBC feed on a digital subchannel. In these areas, NBC programs are available in English and in Spanish via [[second audio program]].

=====Bahamas=====
In the [[Bahamas]], NBC programming is available via U.S.-based affiliate stations on domestic cable providers.

=====Bermuda=====
NBC's entire program lineup is carried by local affiliate [[VSB-TV]] via from the network's East Coast satellite feed and carried one-hour [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] due to the island nation residing in the [[Atlantic Time Zone]] (one hour behind the Eastern Time Zone).

=====Netherlands Antilles=====
In [[Aruba]], NBC maintains an affiliation with [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]] station [[PJA-TV]] (which brands on-air as "ATV").

===Asia Pacific===
====Guam====
In [[Guam]], the entire NBC programming lineup is carried by [[Hagåtña, Guam|Hagåtña]] affiliate [[KUAM-TV]] (which has been an NBC affiliate since 1956) via the network's East Coast satellite feed. Entertainment and news programming is broadcast day and date on a one-day tape delay as Guam is on the west side of the [[International Date Line]] (for example, the network's Thursday prime time lineup airs Friday evenings on KUAM, and is advertised by the station as airing on the latter night in on-air promotions). Live programming, including breaking news and sporting events, airs as scheduled; because of the time difference with the six U.S. time zones, live sports coverage often airs on the station early in the morning. KUAM's programming is relayed to the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] via [[broadcast relay station#satellite stations|satellite station]] [[WSZE]] in [[Saipan]].

====American Samoa====
In [[American Samoa]], NBC has been affiliated with [[KKHJ-LP]] in [[Pago Pago]]<ref>{{cite web|title=US TV and Radio Overseas|url=http://www.astra2.org/ustv.html|publisher=Astra2|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> since 2005. Cable television providers on the islands also carry the network's programming via Seattle affiliate KING-TV.

====Federated States of Micronesia====
In the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], NBC programming is available on domestic cable providers via [[Honolulu]] affiliate [[KHNL]].

====NBC Asia and CNBC Asia====
NBC Asia launched in 1994, distributed to [[Nepal]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]], [[Republic of China]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]] and the [[Philippines|Republic of the Philippines]]. Like with NBC Europe, NBC Asia featured most of NBC's news programs as well as ''The Tonight Show'' and ''Late Night''. Like its European counterpart, it was not allowed to broadcast American-produced primetime shows due to existing broadcast agreements with other domestic broadcasters. NBC Asia produced a regional evening news program that aired each weeknight, and occasionally simulcast some programs from [[CNBC Asia]] and MSNBC. NBC also operated NBC Super Sports, a 24-hour channel devoted to televising sporting events.

In July 1998, NBC Asia was replaced by a regional version of the [[National Geographic Channel (Asia)|National Geographic Channel]]. As is the case with NBC Europe, CNBC Asia broadcasts select episodes of ''The Tonight Show'' and ''Late Night'' as well as ''Meet the Press'' are as part of its weekend schedule, and airs NFL games under the ''Sunday Night Football'' brand.

====Regional partners====
Through regional partners, NBC-produced programs are seen in some countries in the continent. In the [[Philippines]], [[Jack TV]] (owned by Solar Entertainment) airs ''Will & Grace'' and ''Saturday Night Live'', while [[Talktv (Philippines)|TalkTV]] airs ''The Tonight Show'' and NBC News programs including the weekday and [[Weekend Today|weekend]] editions of ''Today'', ''Early Today'', ''Dateline NBC'' and ''NBC Nightly News''. [[Solar TV]] formerly broadcast ''The Jay Leno Show'' from 2009 to 2010. In [[Hong Kong]], English language free-to-air channel TVB Pearl (operated by [[TVB]]) airs live broadcasts of ''NBC Nightly News'', as well as other select NBC programs.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the [[Seven Network]] has maintained close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the U.S. network's image campaigns and slogans since the 1970s (conversely, in 2009, NBC and Seven both used the [[Guy Sebastian]] single "[[Like It like That (Guy Sebastian song)|Like it Like That]]" in image promos for their respective summer schedules). The network's ''[[Seven News]]'' division has used John Williams-composed "The Mission" (the proprietary theme music for NBC News' flagship programs since 1985) as the theme music for its local and national news programs since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were also titled ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until c. 2000. NBC News and Seven News often share news resources, with the former division using Seven's reporters for breaking news coverage and select taped story packages relating to Australian stories and the latter sometimes incorporating NBC News reports into its national bulletins.

Seven also rebroadcasts some of NBC's news and current affairs programming during the early morning hours (usually from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m. local time), including the weekday and weekend editions of ''Today'' (which it brands as ''NBC Today'' to differentiate it from the unrelated [[Today (Australian TV program)|morning program]] on the [[Nine Network]]), ''Dateline NBC'' and ''Meet the Press''.

==Criticism and controversies==
{{See also|Today (U.S. TV program)#Controversies and transitions|MSNBC controversies}}

===Selective editing of George Zimmerman 911 call===
In February 2012, ''Today'' aired a story package that included an edited version of a [[9-1-1]] call made by [[George Zimmerman]] minutes prior to his confrontation with [[Trayvon Martin]] that resulted in [[shooting of Trayvon Martin|the unarmed Florida teenager being shot and killed]], which (as described in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article criticizing the editing of the tape) had the effect of "readily paint[ing] Zimmerman as a [[racial profiling|racial profiler]]". In the edited recording, Zimmerman (who claimed he shot Martin in [[self defense]]; a grand jury later acquitted him on murder charges while on trial in August 2013) is heard saying, "This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black." A portion of the tape in which Zimmerman was describing Martin to the 911 operator was removed in its broadcast version; in the unedited version, Zimmerman said, "This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about." The operator then asked, "OK, and this guy – is he black, white or Hispanic?," to which Zimmerman answered, "He looks black."<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC to do 'internal investigation' on Zimmerman segment|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/nbc-to-do-internal-investigation-on-zimmerman-segment/2012/03/31/gIQAc4HhnS_blog.html?hpid=z6|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=March 31, 2012}}</ref>

|-
| [[Sylvester Weaver (executive)|Sylvester Weaver]] || 1953–1955 || Weaver was hired by NBC in 1949, to help challenge CBS's ratings lead. While at NBC, Weaver established many operating practices that became standard for network television; he introduced the practice of networks producing their own television programs and selling advertising time during the broadcasts. Prior to this, advertising agencies usually developed each show for a particular client. Because commercial slots could now more easily be sold to more than one corporate sponsor for each program, a single advertiser pulling out of a program would not necessarily threaten it. Weaver also created several series for the network, ''Today'' (in 1952), ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]'' (in 1954, the first program in the ''Tonight Show'' franchise), ''Home'' (1954) and ''Wide Wide World'' (1955). Weaver strongly believed that broadcasting should educate as well as entertain and required NBC shows to typically include at least one sophisticated cultural reference or performance per installment – including a segment of a Giuseppe Verdi opera adapted to the comedic style of [[Sid Caesar]] and [[Imogene Coca]]'s groundbreaking ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''. Weaver did not ignore NBC Radio and gave it a shot in the arm in 1955, at a time when network radio was dying and giving way to television, when he developed ''NBC Monitor'', a weekend-long magazine-style block featuring an array of news, music, comedy, drama and sports, with rotating advertisers and some of the most memorable names in broadcast journalism, entertainment and sports that ran until 1975 (20 years after Weaver's departure). Weaver departed shortly afterward, following disputes with NBC chairman David Sarnoff, who believed that his ideas were either too expensive or too [[highbrow]] for company tastes. His respective successors, Robert Sarnoff and Robert Kintner, standardized the network's programming practices with far less of the ambitiousness that characterized the Weaver years.
|-
| [[Robert E. Kintner]] || 1958–1965 || Kitner was appointed President in 1958; his tenure at NBC was marked by his aggressive effort to push the network's news division past CBS News in ratings and prestige. The news division was given more money, leading it to gain additional resources to provide coverage, notably of the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 Presidential election campaign]], and led the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'' to prominence among the network news programs.
|-
| [[Julian Goodman]] || 1966–1977 || Goodman, who joined NBC in 1966, helped establish [[Chet Huntley]] and [[David Brinkley]] as a well-known anchor team. While working at NBC, he negotiated a $1 million deal to retain Johnny Carson as host of ''The Tonight Show''. Goomen led the network until 1974.
|-
| Herb Schlosser || 1974–1978 ||
|-
| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1978–1981 || Although Silverman developed many successful shows during his tenure at ABC, he left that network to become President and CEO of NBC in 1978. His three-year tenure at the network proved to be a difficult period for the network, marked by several high-profile failures such as ''Hello, Larry'', ''Pink Lady and Jeff'', ''Supertrain'' and the [[Jean Doumanian]] era of ''Saturday Night Live'' (Silverman hired Doumanian after Al Franken, the planned successor for outgoing creator/executive producer Lorne Michaels, castigated Silverman's failures in a sketch on the program<ref name="shales"/>). Despite these failures, high points during Silverman's tenure included the launch of ''Hill Street Blues'' and the miniseries ''Shōgun''. He also brought David Letterman to the network to host daytime talker ''[[The David Letterman Show]]'', two years before the debut of Letterman's successful [[Late Night with David Letterman|late night program]] in 1982, after Silverman negotiated a holding deal after the former's cancellation to keep Letterman from going to another network. However, Silverman nearly lost late night leader Johnny Carson, who filed a lawsuit against NBC during a contract dispute with network; the case was settled out of court and Carson remained with NBC in exchange for acquiring the rights to his show and permission to reduce his time on-air (leading to the use of guest hosts on ''The Tonight Show'' such as [[Joan Rivers]] and his immediate successor, Jay Leno).<ref>{{cite news|title=Rent-a-Judge|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952989,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date=April 20, 1981|accessdate=August 7, 2007}}</ref> Silverman also developed successful sitcom such as ''Diff'rent Strokes'', ''The Facts of Life'' and ''Gimme a Break!'', and made the series commitments that led to ''Cheers'' and ''St. Elsewhere''. Silverman also pioneered the reality television genre with the 1979 debut of ''Real People''. His contributions to the network's game show output included the [[Mark Goodson Productions|Goodson-Todman]]-produced ''[[Card Sharks]]'' and a revival of ''Password'', both of which enjoyed great success as part of the morning schedule, although he also canceled several other relatively popular series, including ''The Hollywood Squares'' and ''[[High Rollers]]'', to make way for ''The David Letterman Show'' (those cancellations also threatened ''Wheel of Fortune'', whose host, [[Chuck Woolery]], left in a payment dispute during Silverman's tenure, although the show survived). Silverman also oversaw, while simultaneously objecting to, the hiring of [[Pat Sajak]] as the new host of ''Wheel'' (Sajak remains as host to this day in its syndicated incarnation).<ref>{{cite book|title=Merv: Making the Good Life Last|author=[[Merv Griffin]]|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York City|page=101|year=2003}}</ref> On Saturday mornings, at a time when there was much similarity in animated content on the major networks, Silverman oversaw the development of an [[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|animated series]] based on [[The Smurfs]] (which ran from 1981 to 1989, well after Silverman's departure, making it one of his longest-lasting contributions to the network) as well as [[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980)|a revival of ''The Flintstones'']]. In addition, Silverman revitalized the NBC News division, helping ''Today'' and ''NBC Nightly News'' achieve parity with their competition for the first time in years; and created a new FM radio division with competitive stations in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. During his NBC tenure, Silverman also brought in an entirely new divisional and corporate management team, which remained in place long after Silverman's departure (among this group was Brandon Tartikoff, who as President of Entertainment, would help get NBC back on top by 1985). Silverman also reintroduced the peacock as NBC's corporate logo in 1979.
|-
| [[Brandon Tartikoff]] || 1981–1991 || Tartikoff was hired as a program executive at ABC in 1976. He joined NBC the following year, after being hired by Dick Ebersol to direct comedy programs for the network. Tartikoff took over as president of NBC's entertainment division in 1981,<ref name="BarberaAutoBio">{{cite book|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|pages=188–189}}</ref> becoming the youngest person ever to hold the position, at age 32. At the time Tartikoff took over, NBC was mired in last place behind ABC and CBS, and faced a looming writers' strike and affiliates defecting to other networks (mostly to ABC); ''Little House on the Prairie'', ''Diff'rent Strokes'' and ''Real People'' were the only prime time shows the network had in the Nielsen Top 20. Also of issue, Johnny Carson was reportedly in talks to move his landmark late-night talk show to ABC; while the original cast and writing staff of ''Saturday Night Live'' had left the show, and their replacements had earned ''SNL'' some of its worst reviews. By 1982, Tartikoff and network president Grant Tinker gradually turned the network's fortunes around.<ref name="BrandonAutoBio">{{cite book|title=The Last Great Ride|author=[[Brandon Tartikoff]]|publisher=[[Hyperion Books]]|location=New York City|year=1992|isbn=0-394-58709-X}}</ref> Tartikoff's successes as President of Entertainment included ''The Cosby Show'' (Tartikoff had pursued actor-comedian [[Bill Cosby]] to create a comedy [[pilot episode|pilot]] after having been impressed by the comedian's stories when Cosby was a guest host on ''The Tonight Show''), the iconic 1980s drama ''Miami Vice'' (Tartikoff wrote a [[brainstorming]] [[memorandum|memo]] that simply read "[[MTV]] [[police|cops]]," and later presented it to former ''Hill Street Blues'' writer/producer [[Anthony Yerkovich]], who turned into the concept behind ''Miami Vice'').<ref name=makingofvice>{{cite book|title=The Making of Miami Vice|author=[[Trish Janeshutz]]|publisher=Ballatine Books|location=New York City|year=1986|pages=12|isbn=0-345-33669-0}}</ref><ref name=coolcops>{{cite journal|title=Cool Cops, Hot Show|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959822,00.html|author=[[Richard Zoglin]]|journal=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=September 16, 1985|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name=memo>{{cite news|title=Guiding No. 1: The Man Who Programs NBC|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D91438F93AA25757C0A96E948260|author=Peter J.

Keaton,<ref name="BrandonAutoBio"/> however, creator/executive producer [[Gary David Goldberg]] insisted on having Fox in the role until Tartikoff relented, saying, "Go ahead if you insist. But I'm telling you, this is not the kind of face you'll ever see on a [[lunch box]]". After Fox's stardom was cemented by ''[[Back to the Future]]'', he good-naturedly sent Tartikoff a lunch box with Fox's picture that contained a note reading: "To Brandon: This is for you to put your [[Eat crow|crow]] in. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox," which Tartikoff kept in his office for the rest of his career. Johnny Carson broke the news of his retirement in February 1991 to Tartikoff during a lunch meeting at the Grille in Beverly Hills. Tartikoff and chairman Bob Wright were the only ones who knew of the planned retirement before it was made public days later.<ref name="BrandonAutoBio"/> Tartikoff wrote in his memoirs that his biggest professional regret was cancelling the series ''[[Buffalo Bill (TV series)|Buffalo Bill]]'', which he later went on to include in a fantasy "dream schedule" created for a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article that detailed his idea of "The Greatest Network Ever."

Other critical and/or commercial successes greenlit under Zucker included ''Las Vegas'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. He originated the concept of airing "Supersized" episodes (running longer than the standard 30-minute slot) of NBC sitcoms during sweeps and making aggressive programming efforts during the summer to compete with cable networks that began to draw viewers to their original programming content while the networks ran mostly reruns. Zucker also oversaw the successful transition of [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] (which NBC acquired from [[Rainbow Media]] in 2002) from an film and arts-focused network to a network primarily reliant on reality series, and the repositioning of Telemundo to become more competitive with leading Spanish language network Univision. In May 2004, following NBC's merger with [[Vivendi Universal]], Zucker was promoted to president of the NBC Universal Television Group. Zucker's responsibilities, which already included NBC's cable channels, were expanded to include oversight of television production as well as [[USA Network]], [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] and [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]]. Following his promotion, NBC slid from first place to fourth in the ratings. Shows that Zucker championed such as animated series ''[[Father of the Pride]]'' and the ''Friends'' spinoff ''Joey'' floundered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Now Jeff Zucker Must Prove Himself Yet Again|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_08/b4022042.htm |publisher=[[Businessweek]]|date=February 19, 2007|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>
