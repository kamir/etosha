He is the host and executive producer of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', a [[late-night talk show]] that premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2003.

==Career==

===Radio career===
Kimmel began working in the radio industry while in high school, hosting a Sunday night interview show on [[UNLV]]'s college station, [[KUNV]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} While attending [[Arizona State University]], he became a popular caller to the KZZP-FM afternoon show hosted by radio personalities Mike Elliott and [[Kent Voss]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. In 1989, Kimmel landed his first paying job alongside Voss as morning drive co-host of ''The Me and Him Show'' at [[KZOK-FM]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Ten months later, Kimmel and Voss were fired by KZOK and were fired again a year later at [[WRBQ-FM]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Kimmel went on to host his own show at [[KCMJ]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], where he persuaded a young [[Carson Daly]] to drop out of college and become his intern. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After a morning stint at [[KRQQ]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], Kimmel landed at [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles. He spent five years as "Jimmy The Sports Guy" for the [[Kevin and Bean]] morning show. During this time he met and befriended a struggling comedian named [[Adam Carolla]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Carolla|first=Adam|title=In 50 Years We'll All Be Chicks|year=2010|publisher=Crown Archetype|isbn=0307717372}}<!-- page(s)?? --></ref>

===Comedy Central===
Kimmel began his television career as the comedic counterpart to [[Ben Stein]] on the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', which began airing on [[Comedy Central]] in 1997. His quick wit and "[[everyman]]" personality were counterpoints to Stein's monotonous vocal style and faux-[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] demeanor. The combination earned the pair an [[Emmy]] award for Best Game Show Host.<ref>{{cite web|title=Awards for "Win Ben Stein's Money"|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118515/awards|accessdate=September 14, 2012}}</ref>

In 1999, during his time with ''Win Ben Stein's Money'', Kimmel co-hosted (with Carolla) and co-produced (with [[Daniel Kellison]]), Comedy Central's ''[[The Man Show]]''.<ref name="imdb"/> Kimmel left ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' in 2001 and was replaced by comedian [[Nancy Pimental]], who was eventually replaced by Kimmel's cousin [[Sal Iacono]]. ''[[The Man Show]]'''s success allowed Kimmel, Carolla, and Kellison to create and produce, under the banner [[Jackhole Productions]], ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for [[Comedy Central]] (on which Kimmel plays the characters "Elmer Higgins", "Terrence Catheter", "The Nudge", "[[Karl Malone]]" and himself) and later ''[[The Andy Milonakis Show]]'' for MTV2. Kimmel also produced and co-wrote the feature film ''[[Windy City Heat]]'', which won the Comedia Award for Best Film at the [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Awards for "Windy City Heat"|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383053/awards|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=September 14, 2012}}</ref>

===''Jimmy Kimmel Live!''===
[[File:JimmyKimmelHWOFSept2012.jpg|thumb|right|Kimmel in September 2012]]
{{main|Jimmy Kimmel Live!}}
In January 2003, Jimmy Kimmel permanently left ''The Man Show'' to host his own late-night talk show, ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. ''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' was briefly also broadcast on Irish digital TV channel 3e. In the April 2007 issue of Stuffmagazine.com, Kimmel was named the "biggest badass on TV". Kimmel said it was an honor but clearly a mistake. Since the show's second season, it has not actually been broadcast live. The incident that led ABC to force the show to tape early was when [[Thomas Jane]] cursed repeatedly and the censors were unable to properly [[bleep censor]] it.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} With the increasing popularity and people searching for him online made his name as bait for the cyber attackers. As a result of this, McAfee placed him in the first place in the list of most dangerous celebrities to search online.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top 10 list of Dangerous Celebrities To Search Online|url=http://www.filmental.net/10-dangerous-celebrities-search-browser-2014|date= October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

During an incident during the [[2004 NBA Finals]] in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC's halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show. He suggested that if the [[Detroit Pistons]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], "they're gonna burn the city of Detroit down ... and it's not worth it." Officials with Detroit's ABC affiliate, [[WXYZ-TV]], immediately announced that that night's show would not air on the station. Hours later, ABC officials pulled that night's show from the entire network. Kimmel later apologized.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Susman|title=The Ban Show|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,650146,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2004|accessdate=January 2, 2009}}</ref>

Kimmel usually ends his show with "My apologies to [[Matt Damon]], we ran out of time." When Matt Damon did actually appear on the show to be interviewed, he walked in and sat down only to be told just a few seconds later by Kimmel, "Sorry, but once again we are completely out of time." Damon seemed to become angry. In the December 17, 2006, issue of ''USA Weekend'', Kimmel himself acknowledged that the Damon incident was a joke. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In February 2008, Kimmel showed a mock music video with a panoply of stars called "[[I'm fucking matt damon|I'm Fucking Ben Affleck]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20180150,00.html|title=So Long, Sarah! Jimmy Kimmel Is, Well, 'Dating' Ben Affleck|first=Stephen M.|last=Silverman|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=February 25, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2008}}</ref> as "revenge" after his then-girlfriend [[Sarah Silverman]] and Damon recorded a similar video titled, "[[I'm Fucking Matt Damon]]". Silverman's video originally aired on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' and became an "instant YouTube sensation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20175789,00.html|title=Behind Matt Damon's Raunchy Payback to Jimmy Kimmel|first=Julie|last=Jordan|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=February 2, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2008}}</ref> Kimmel's "revenge" video featured himself, [[Ben Affleck]], and a large lineup of stars, particularly in scenes spoofing the 1985 "[[We Are the World]]" video: [[Brad Pitt]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Benji Madden]] and [[Joel Madden]] from [[Good Charlotte]], [[Lance Bass]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Huey Lewis]], [[Perry Farrell]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[Pete Wentz]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Christina Applegate]], [[Dom Joly]], [[Mike Shinoda]], [[Lauren Conrad]], and [[Joan Jett]], among others.

After this, Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, appeared in a spoof of ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon on the red carpet one time and before he could finish the interview he said, "Sorry, we are out of time." The most recent encounter was titled "The Handsome Men's Club" which featured Kimmel, along with the "Handsome Men", who were: [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Keith Urban]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Tony Romo]], [[Ted Danson]], [[Taye Diggs]], [[Gilles Marini]], and [[Ben Affleck]], speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by none other than [[Matt Damon]], stating that they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh. [[Jennifer Garner]] also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' appear on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', causing Kimmel to describe himself as "the [[Cerberus|three-headed dog]] the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell".<ref name="imdb"/>

In October 2013, a new segment of the show, "Kids Table", showcased five and six-year olds discussing the U.S. government shutdown and U.S. debts. When one of the children suggested "killing all the people in China", as a way of resolving the U.S. debt, Kimmel responded that that was "an interesting idea" and soon jokingly asked a follow up: “Should we allow the Chinese to live?”.<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/10/28/jimmy-kimmel-live-china-joke-apology|title=ABC apologizes for child's China joke on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live''|date=October 28, 2013|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref> The incident triggered discussions and protests on Internet, even from [[Mainland China]]. In an October 25 letter to a group called the [[80-20 Initiative]], which identifies itself as a pan-Asian-American political organization, ABC apologized for the segment, saying "We would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the Chinese community, Asian community, anyone of Chinese descent or any community at large."<ref name=ew/><ref name="time">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/28/kids-say-the-most-divisive-things-asian-americans-protest-jimmy-kimmel|title=Asian Americans Protest Jimmy Kimmel|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|date=October 28, 2013|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

More than 100 people took to the streets in San Francisco on October 28 to protest the show and demand "a more elaborate apology" and that Kimmel to be fired.<ref name=time/> On that day's broadcast, Kimmel addressed the controversy personally, saying: "I thought it was obvious that I didn't agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn't ... So I just wanted to say, I'm sorry, I apologize.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/29/abc-apologizes-for-kill-everyone-in-china-line-on-jimmy-kimmel-live|title=ABC Apologizes for "Kill Everyone in China" Line on Jimmy Kimmel Live|last=Little|first=Lyneka|date=October 29, 2013|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref> Despite the apologies from ABC and Kimmel, protests continued.
