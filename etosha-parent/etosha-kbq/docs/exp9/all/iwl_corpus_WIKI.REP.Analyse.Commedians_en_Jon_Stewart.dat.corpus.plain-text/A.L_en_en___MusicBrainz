'''MusicBrainz''' is a project that aims to create an [[open content]] [[music]] database. Similar to the [[freedb]] project, it was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the [[CDDB]]. However, MusicBrainz has expanded its goals to reach beyond a [[compact disc]] [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] storehouse to become a structured open online database for music.<ref>Highfield, Ashley. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/highfield_iea.shtml Keynote speech given at IEA Future Of Broadcasting Conference]", [[BBC]] [[News release|Press Office]], 2007-06-27. Retrieved on 2008-02-11.</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1109/5254.988466}}</ref>

MusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title, track titles, and the length of each track. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written [[MusicBrainz:Style Guideline|style guidelines]]. Recorded works can additionally store information about the release date and country, the CD ID, [[cover art]], [[acoustic fingerprint]], free-form annotation text and other metadata. {{As of|2015|5|12}}, MusicBrainz contained information about roughly 950,000 artists, 1.5 million releases, and 14.8 million recordings.<ref name=statistics>{{cite web | title = Database Statistics | publisher = MusicBrainz | url = http://musicbrainz.org/statistics | accessdate = 2015-05-12 }}</ref>

End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add [[ID3 tag|metadata tag]]s to their digital media files, such as [[MP3]], [[Ogg Vorbis]] or [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]].

== Cover Art Archive ==
MusicBrainz allows contributors to upload [[cover art]] images of releases to the database; these images are hosted by Cover Art Archive (CAA), a joint project between [[Internet Archive]] and MusicBrainz started in 2012. Internet Archive provides the bandwidth, storage and legal protection for hosting the images, while MusicBrainz stores metadata and provides public access through the web and via an [[Application programming interface|API]] for third parties to use.

As with other contributions, the MusicBrainz community is in charge for maintaining and reviewing the data.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fabian Scherschel |title=MusicBrainz and Internet Archive create cover art database |date={{date|2012-10-10}} |publisher=The H |url=http://h-online.com/-1727322 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131207234912/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/MusicBrainz-and-Internet-Archive-create-cover-art-database-1727322.html|archivedate=7 December 2013}}</ref>

Cover art is also provided for items on sale at [[Amazon.com]] and some other online resources, but CAA is now preferred because it gives the community more control and flexibility for managing the images.

== Fingerprinting ==
Besides collecting metadata about music, MusicBrainz also allows looking up recordings by their [[acoustic fingerprint]].
A separate application, such as [[MusicBrainz Picard]], must be used for this.

=== Proprietary services ===
In the year 2000, MusicBrainz started using Relatable's [[patent]]ed TRM (a [[recursive acronym]] for TRM Recognizes Music) for fingerprint matching. This feature attracted many users and allowed the database to grow quickly.
However, by 2005 TRM was showing scalability issues as the number of tracks in the database had reached into the millions.
This issue was resolved in May 2006 when MusicBrainz partnered with MusicIP (now [[AmpliFIND]]) replacing TRM with MusicDNS.<ref name="musicdns_announcement">{{cite press release | title=New fingerprinting technology available now! | date=2006-03-12|publisher=MusicBrainz community blog | url=http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/03/new_fingerprint.html | accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> TRMs were phased out and fully replaced by MusicDNS in November 2008.

=== AcoustID and Chromaprint ===
In October 2009 MusicIP was acquired by [[AmpliFIND]].<ref>[http://www.amplifindmusicservices.com/news/press/amplified-music-aims-to-liberate-your-music.php AmpliFIND Music Services: News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Some time after the acquisition, the MusicDNS service began having intermittent problems.
Since the future of the free identification service was uncertain, a replacement for it was sought.

The Chromaprint acoustic fingerprinting algorithm, the basis for AcoustID identification service, was started in February 2010 by a long-time MusicBrainz contributor Lukáš Lalinský.<ref>[http://oxygene.sk/2010/07/introducing-chromaprint/ Introducing Chromaprint - Lukáš Lalinský<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While AcoustID and Chromaprint are not officially MusicBrainz projects, they are closely tied with each other and both are open source.

Chromaprint works by analyzing the first two minutes of a track, detecting the strength in each of 12 [[pitch class]]es, storing these 8 times per second. Additional post-processing is then applied to compress this fingerprint while retaining patterns.<ref>[http://oxygene.sk/2011/01/how-does-chromaprint-work/ How does Chromaprint work? - Lukáš Lalinský<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The AcoustID search server then searches from the database of fingerprints by similarity and returns the AcoustID identifier along with MusicBrainz recording identifiers if known.

== Licensing ==
Since 2003,<ref>{{Wayback |date=20030413174459 |url=http://musicbrainz.org/news/licenses.html |title=MusicBrainz Licenses<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> MusicBrainz's core data (artists, recordings, releases, and so on) are in the [[public domain]], and additional content, including moderation data (essentially every [[Threshold of originality|original content]] contributed by users and its elaborations), is placed under the [[Creative Commons]] [[CC-BY-NC-SA]]-2.0 license.<ref>[http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_License?oldid=33484 MusicBrainz License] as of 13-11-2010.</ref>  The [[relational database management system]] is [[PostgreSQL]]. The server software is covered by the [[GNU General Public License]].
The MusicBrainz client [[software library]], ''libmusicbrainz'', is licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], which allows use of the code by proprietary software products.

In December 2004, the MusicBrainz project was turned over to the [[MetaBrainz Foundation]], a [[non-profit]] group, by its creator Robert Kaye.<ref name="metabrainz_announcement">{{cite press release | first=Robert | last=Kaye | title=The MetaBrainz Foundation launches! | date=2006-03-12 | publisher=MusicBrainz community blog | url=http://blog.musicbrainz.org/?p=102 | accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref>

On 20 January 2006, it was announced that the first commercial venture to use MusicBrainz data is the [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], [[Spain]] based [[Linkara (Social networking service)|Linkara]] in their [[Linkara Música]] service.<ref>{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Kaye | url=http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/01/introducing_lin_1.html | title=Introducing: Linkara Musica | publisher=MusicBrainz | date=2006-01-20 | accessdate=2006-08-12}}</ref>

On 28 June 2007 [[BBC]] announced that it has licensed MusicBrainz's live data feed to augment their music Web pages.

The BBC online music editors will also join the MusicBrainz community to contribute their knowledge to the database.<ref>{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Kaye | url=http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2007/06/the_bbc_partner.html | title=The BBC partners with MusicBrainz for Music Metadata | publisher=MusicBrainz | date=2007-06-28 | accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref>

On 28 July 2008, the beta of the new BBC Music site was launched, which publishes a page for each MusicBrainz artist.<ref>{{cite news | first=Matthew | last=Shorter | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/07/bbc_music_artist_pages_beta.html | title=BBC Music Artist Pages Beta | publisher=BBC | date=2008-07-28 | accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/brainz/  MusicBrainz and the BBC] as of 2013-03-16</ref>
