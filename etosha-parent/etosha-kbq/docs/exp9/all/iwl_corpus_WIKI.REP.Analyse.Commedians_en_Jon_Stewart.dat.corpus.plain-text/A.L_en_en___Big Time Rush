It is the main setting for the series and plenty of the scenes are taking place in the Palm Woods '''''lobby''''', '''''park''''' or '''''pool''''' as well as in the apartments and even the air ducts. It's commonly described as the home for the future famous since its residents are mostly aspiring actors/actresses, singers, models or performers such as Camille, Jo, The Jennifers, Lucy, Guitar Dude, Tyler and many others. It is run by the strict manager Mr. Bitters while Buddha Bob works as the janitor.

Names that worked with Rocque Records include ''Jordin Sparks'' while its rival company is named Hawk Records.

=== Apartment 2J ===
The apartment 2J is the Big Time Rush's apartment of the Palm Woods Hotel. It got its current form in [[List of Big Time Rush episodes|Big Time Crib]] as it used to be simplistic, dirty and messy before. It features a swirly slide and latest home electronics and arcade games. It is claimed that ''Lindsay Lohan'', ''Shia LeBeouf'' and ''Kanye West'', all stayed in that room in the past. Its interior altered once more when James left Big Time Rush in [[Big Time Concert]] and removed into 2J, but it came back to normal soon.

The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' stated the show was "Nick's attempt at building a [[Jonas Brothers]]-style pop band. It's Nick's answer to Disney Channel's '[[JONAS (TV series)|JONAS]],' albeit slightly less organic since 'Rush' doesn't feature siblings."<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10018/1029034-67.stm#ixzz0dZRVWAux Owen, Rob. "Producer of FX's 'Justified' Recalls 'Boom' Times Here."] ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]].''

"Also On Tonight: 'Buried Life,' 'American Pickers'."] ''[[Hartford Courant]].'' January 18, 2010.</ref> The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' stated the show as "one example in a growing list of kid shows selling showbiz fantasies to children. The genre is stronger than ever now and more fixated on the perks of the glamorous Hollywood lifestyle ... wish fulfillment at a time when tabloid dreams are ubiquitous."<ref name="Boston"/> [[DVD Talk]] had the following review of the Big Time Rush: Season 1, Volume 1 DVD. "It would be hard to craft a description engineered to be less interesting to me, and yet, as I plowed through this collection from the series' beginnings, I frequently found myself amended and entertained. Say what you will about Nickelodeon's teen programming, but they've got the art of making a solid sitcom down to a science."<ref>[http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/50001/big-time-rush/ Rizzzo III, Francis.
