The '''World Trade Center''' is a partially completed complex of buildings, under construction, in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[United States]], replacing an earlier complex of seven buildings with the same name on the same site. The original World Trade Center featured landmark twin towers, which opened on April 4, 1973, and were destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, along with [[7 World Trade Center]]. The other buildings in the complex were severely damaged by the collapse of the twin towers, and their ruins were eventually demolished. The site is being rebuilt with six new skyscrapers, a [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|memorial]] to those killed in the attacks, and a [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|transportation hub]]. [[One World Trade Center]], the tallest building in the [[United States]], is the lead building for the new complex, reaching more than 100 stories<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/new-world-trade-center-climbs-to-100-stories-1.3637907 |title = New World Trade Center climbs to 100 stories |agency = [[Associated Press]] |date = April 2, 2012 }}</ref> upon its completion in November 2014.<ref name="yahoo"/>

At the time of their completion, the "Twin Towers" — the original [[One_World_Trade_Center#Original_building|1 World Trade Center]], at {{convert|1368|ft|m}}; and [[Two_World_Trade_Center#Original_building|2 World Trade Center]] — were the [[History of the tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings (from 1901)|tallest buildings]] in the world.

All these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985, with a construction cost of $400&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400000000|1971|2014|r=-8}}}} in 2014 dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US}} The complex was located in New York City's [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and contained {{convert|13400000|sqft|m2}} of office space.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E4D81030F935A35752C0A9649C8B63 |title = Commercial Property; In Office Market, a Time of Uncertainty |work = The New York Times |author = Holusha, John |date = January 6, 2002 |accessdate = November 21, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_30_48/ai_83762552 |title = Ford recounts details of Sept. 11 |work = Real Estate Weekly |date = February 27, 2002 |publisher = BNET |accessdate = January 3, 2009 }}</ref>

On the morning of [[September 11, 2001]], [[Al-Qaeda]]-affiliated hijackers flew two [[Boeing 767]] jets into the complex, beginning with the North Tower at 8:46 AM then the South Tower at 9:03 AM, in a coordinated act of [[terrorism]]. After burning for 56&nbsp;minutes, the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 AM. 29 minutes later, the North Tower collapsed.

==Original buildings==

===Before the World Trade Center===
[[File:Radio Row-Berenice Abbott.jpg|225px|left|thumb|The [[Radio Row]] in 1936, with the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Ninth Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station in the background, as seen in a photograph by [[Berenice Abbott]]]]
The western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the [[Hudson River]], with the shoreline in the vicinity of Greenwich Street. It was on this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich and the former Dey Street that Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]]'s ship, the ''[[Tyger (ship)|Tyger]]'', burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in [[Manhattan]]. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of a second ship from the eighteenth century were discovered in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River [[sloop]], was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about 20 feet below the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-15/us/new.york.ground.zero.ship_1_ship-archaeologist-ground-zero?_s=PM:US|title=CNN: Pieces of ship made in 1700s found at ground zero building site|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>

Later, the area became [[Radio Row]]. New York City's Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966, was a warehouse district on the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|Lower West Side]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. Harry Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921, and eventually the area held several blocks of electronics stores, with Cortlandt Street as its central axis. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., [[ARC-5]] radios), junk, and parts often piled so high they would spill out onto the street, attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was the origin of the electronic component distribution business.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ruthless Execution: What Business Leaders Do When Their Companies Hit the Wall|first=Amir|last=Hartman|publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall|year=2004|isbn=0-13-101884-1}}, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0131018841&id=hlmssVxlUUgC&pg=RA63-PA167&lpg=RA63-PA167&sig=Ggo8KPh1PnE9-5UuWOpDfAGMAwQ p. 167] "The electronic component distribution business started in the 1920s and 1930s, selling radio tubes on lower Manhattan's Cortland{{sic}} St...."</ref>

The idea of establishing a World Trade Center in New York City was first proposed in 1943. The [[New York State Legislature]] passed a bill authorizing New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] to begin developing plans for the project<ref name="nyt-07061946">{{Cite news |title=Dewey Picks Board for Trade Center |work=The New York Times |date=July 6, 1946}}</ref> but the plans were put on hold in 1949.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lets Port Group Disband, State Senate for Dissolution of World Trade Corporation |work=The New York Times |date=March 11, 1949}}</ref> During the late 1940s and 1950s, economic growth in New York City was concentrated in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. To help stimulate [[urban renewal]] in Lower Manhattan, [[David Rockefeller]] suggested that the Port Authority build a World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.<ref>Gillespie (1999), pp. 32–33</ref>

Plans for the use of [[eminent domain]] to remove the shops in Radio Row bounded by [[Vesey Street (Manhattan)|Vesey]], [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church]], [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty]], and [[West Street (Manhattan)|West]] Streets began in 1961 when the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] was deciding to build the world's first [[List of World Trade Centers|world trade center]]. They had two choices: the east side of [[Lower Manhattan]], near the [[South Street Seaport]]; and the west side, near the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad|H&M]] station, [[Hudson Terminal]].<ref name="glanz">{{cite book|title=City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center|first= James|last=Glanz|author2=Eric Lipton |year=2003|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8050-7428-7 | url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0805074287&id=yE1Pyui4GpkC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62}}</ref>{{rp|page=56}} Initial plans, made public in 1961, identified a site along the [[East River]] for the World Trade Center.<ref>Gillespie (1999), pp. 34–35</ref> As a bi-state agency, the Port Authority required approval for new projects from the governors of both [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]].

====Architectural design====
[[File:World Trade Center Building Design with Floor and Elevator Arrangement.svg|thumb|225px|left|A typical floor layout and elevator arrangement of the WTC towers.]]

On {{Nowrap|September 20}}, 1962, the Port Authority announced the selection of [[Minoru Yamasaki]] as lead architect and [[Emery Roth|Emery Roth & Sons]] as associate architects.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Architect Named for Trade Center |author=Esterow, Milton |date=September 21, 1962 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Yamasaki devised the plan to incorporate twin towers; Yamasaki's original plan called for the towers to be 80 stories tall,<ref name="nyt-1964jan19a">{{Cite news|title=A New Era Heralded |author=Huxtable, Ada Louise |work=The New York Times |date=January 19, 1964}}</ref> but to meet the Port Authority's requirement for {{convert|10000000|sqft|m2}} of office space, the buildings would each have to be 110 stories tall.<ref name="huxtable">{{Cite news |title=Biggest Buildings Herald New Era |author=Huxtable, Ada Louise |date=January 26, 1964 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

A major limiting factor in building height is the issue of elevators; the taller the building, the more elevators are needed to service the building, requiring more space-consuming elevator banks.<ref name="huxtable" /> Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system with two "[[sky lobby|sky lobbies]]"—floors where people could switch from a large-capacity express elevator to a local elevator that goes to each floor in a section. This system, inspired by the local-express train operation that the [[New York City Subway]] system used,<ref name="gillespie-p76">Gillespie (1999), p. 76</ref> allowed the design to stack local elevators within the same elevator shaft. Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently, increasing the amount of usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of elevator shafts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/NISTNCSTAR1-1.pdf |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |page=9 |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

Yamasaki's design for the World Trade Center, unveiled to the public on {{Nowrap|January 18}}, 1964, called for a square plan approximately {{convert|208|ft|m}} in dimension on each side.<ref name="nyt-1964jan19a" /><ref>NIST NCSTAR 1-1 (2005), p. 7</ref> The buildings were designed with narrow office windows {{convert|18|in|cm}} wide, which reflected Yamasaki's [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]] as well as his desire to make building occupants feel secure.<ref name="pekala">{{Cite news|title=Profile of a lost landmark; World Trade Center |publisher=Journal of Property Management |date=November 1, 2001 |author=Pekala, Nancy}}</ref> Yamasaki's design included building facades sheathed in aluminum-alloy.<ref name="nyt-1966may29">{{Cite news|title=Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Buildings |author=Huxtable, Ada Louise |date=May 29, 1966 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The World Trade Center was one of the most-striking American implementations of the architectural ethic of [[Le Corbusier]], and it was the seminal expression of Yamasaki's gothic modernist tendencies.<ref>Darton (1999), pp. 32–34</ref>

In addition to the twin towers, the plan for the World Trade Center complex included four other low-rise buildings, which were built in the early 1970s. The 47-story 7&nbsp;World Trade Center building was added in the 1980s, to the north of the main complex. Altogether, the main World Trade Center complex occupied a {{convert|16|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[City block#Superblock|superblock]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Nobel, Philip |title=Sixteen Acres: Architecture and the Outrageous Struggle for the Future of Ground Zero |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |page=54 |isbn=0-8050-8002-3}}</ref>

====Structural design====
[[File:Twin Towers under construction.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Construction underway in late 1969]]
[[File:WTC-1971-under-construction.jpg|thumb|left|200px|World Trade Center under construction in 1970]]

The structural engineering firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the [[tube (structure)|tube-frame structural system]] used in the twin towers. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as [[geotechnical engineering|foundation engineers]], Joseph R. Loring & Associates as [[electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], and Jaros, Baum & Bolles as [[mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]]. [[Tishman Realty & Construction|Tishman Realty & Construction Company]] was the [[general contractor]] on the World Trade Center project. [[Guy F. Tozzoli]], director of the World Trade Department at the Port Authority, and Rino M. Monti, the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, oversaw the project.<ref>NIST NCSTAR 1 (2005), p. 1</ref> As an interstate agency, the Port Authority was not subject to local laws and regulations of the City of New York, including [[building code]]s. Nonetheless, the structural engineers of the World Trade Center ended up following draft versions of the new 1968 building codes.<ref name="ncstar1-1-p10">NIST NCSTAR 1-1 (2005), pp. 40–42</ref>

The tube-frame design, earlier introduced by [[Fazlur Khan]], was a new approach that allowed more open floor plans than the traditional design that distributed columns throughout the interior to support building loads. The World Trade Center towers used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] that were spaced closely together to form a strong, rigid wall structure, supporting virtually all lateral loads such as wind loads, and sharing the gravity load with the core columns. The perimeter structure containing 59 columns per side was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, each consisting of three columns, three stories tall, connected by [[wikt:spandrel|spandrel]] plates.<ref name="ncstar1-1-p10">NIST NCSTAR 1-1 (2005), p. 10</ref> The spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop.<ref>NIST NCSTAR 1 (2005), p. 8</ref> Adjacent modules were bolted together with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting [[shear stress]] between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so that the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.<ref name="ncstar1-1-p10" />

The core of the towers housed the elevator and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135&nbsp;feet (27 by 41&nbsp;m) and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower. The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight as well as [[live loads]], providing lateral stability to the exterior walls and distributing wind loads among the exterior walls.<ref>NIST NCSTAR 1 (2005), pp. 8–9</ref> The floors consisted of {{convert|4|in|cm}} thick lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors.<ref name="NIST NCSTAR 1 2005, p. 10">NIST NCSTAR 1 (2005), p. 10</ref> The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns and were on 6&nbsp;foot 8&nbsp;inch (2.03&nbsp;m) centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] dampers that helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.

Hat [[truss]]es (or "outrigger truss") located from the 107th floor to the top of the buildings were designed to support a tall communication antenna on top of each building.<ref name="NIST NCSTAR 1 2005, p. 10" /> Only 1&nbsp;WTC (north tower) actually had an antenna fitted; it was added in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/newyork/sfeature/sf_building_pop_01_qt.html |title=New York: A Documentary Film – The Center of the World (Construction Footage) |publisher=Port Authority / PBS |accessdate=May 16, 2007}}</ref> The truss system consisted of six trusses along the long axis of the core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower.<ref name="NIST NCSTAR 1 2005, p. 10" />

[[File:Twin Towers-NYC.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[World Financial Center]] and [[Battery Park City]], next to the World Trade Center, were built on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]].]]

The tube frame design, using steel core and perimeter columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material, created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more in response to the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the [[Empire State Building]] that have thick, heavy masonry for [[fireproofing]] of steel structural elements.<ref name="glanz"/>{{rp|page=138}} During the design process, [[wind tunnel]] tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces.<ref>NIST NCSTAR 1-1A (2005), p. 65</ref> Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects.<ref name="glanz"/>{{rp|page=139–144}} One of the chief engineers [[Leslie Robertson]] worked with Canadian engineer [[Alan Garnett Davenport|Alan G. Davenport]] to develop viscoelastic [[damping|dampers]] to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.<ref name="glanz"/>{{rp|page=160–167}}

Plans to build the World Trade Center were controversial.

====Other buildings====

[[File:WTC-looking north.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The World Trade Center from the then newly completed [[West Side Highway]] in {{Nowrap|July 2001}}.]]

Five smaller buildings stood around the {{convert|16|acre|m2}} block. One was the 22-floor hotel, which opened in 1981 as the Vista Hotel, and in 1995 became the [[Marriott World Trade Center]] (3&nbsp;WTC) at the southwest corner of the site. Three low-rise buildings (4&nbsp;WTC, 5&nbsp;WTC, and 6&nbsp;WTC) in the same hollow tube design as the towers also stood around the plaza. [[6&nbsp;World Trade Center]], at the northwest corner, housed the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|United States Customs Service]] and the [[Commodities exchange|U.S. Commodities Exchange]]. [[5&nbsp;World Trade Center]] was located at the northeast corner above the [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|PATH station]] and [[4 World Trade Center (1975-2001)|4&nbsp;World Trade Center]] was at the southeast corner. In 1987, a 47-floor office building called 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was built north of the block. Beneath the World Trade Center complex was an [[The Mall at the World Trade Center|underground shopping mall]], which in turn had connections to various mass transit facilities including the [[New York City Subway]] system and the Port Authority's own [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] trains connecting Manhattan to [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labelscar.com/new-york/mall-at-world-trade-center|title=The Mall at the World Trade Center; New York, New York - Labelscar|work=Labelscar: The Retail History Blog|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>

====February 13, 1975 fire====
On February 13, 1975, a [[three-alarm fire]] broke out on the 11th floor of the North Tower. Fire spread through the tower to the 9th and 14th floors by igniting the insulation of telephone cables in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors. Areas at the furthest extent of the fire were extinguished almost immediately and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was concentrated on the 11th floor, fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. [[Fireproofing]] protected the steel and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to damage caused by the fire on the 9th - 14th floors, water from the extinguishing of the fires damaged a few floors below. At that time, the World Trade Center had no [[fire sprinkler system]]s.<ref name="nyt 19750214">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/14/nyregion/14WTC.html |title=Trade Center Hit by 6-Floor Fire |work=The New York Times |date=February 14, 1975 |accessdate=September 11, 2008}}</ref>

With the main World Trade Center site, numerous stakeholders were involved including Silverstein and the Port Authority, which in turn meant that [[George Pataki]], the then-[[Governor of New York]], had some authority. In addition, the victims' families, people in the surrounding neighborhoods, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], and others wanted input. Governor Pataki established the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC) in {{Nowrap|November 2001}} as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD81639F930A35752C1A9679C8B63 |author=Pérez-Peña, Richard |title=State Plans Rebuilding Agency, Perhaps Led by Giuliani |work=The New York Times |date=November 3, 2001 |accessdate=November 19, 2008}}</ref> The LMDC held a competition to solicit possible designs for the site.

Days before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair [[John C.

As the Twin Towers' insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built.

Rafael Viñoly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the THINK design. Earlier the same day, however, [[Roland Betts]], a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC's decision.<ref name=breakingground /> On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.

Libeskind's original proposal, which is titled [[Memory Foundations]], underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein, and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whom Silverstein hired.<ref>http://www.renewnyc.com/plan_des_dev/wtc_site/new_design_plans/Sept_2003_refined_design.asp</ref> Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes.  As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding.<ref>http://www.wtc.com/news/Silversteins-Army</ref>  The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the "swap" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial.<ref>http://www.americanlawyer-digital.com/americanlawyer/tal200709/?pg=5</ref>  The "swap" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Raab|title=Construction of World Trade Center|publisher=Esquire|date=May 24, 2007}}</ref>

A report in September 2013 revealed that, at the time of the report, the World Trade Center Association (WTCA) continues to negotiate with the One World Trade Center in regard to the title "World Trade Center", as the WTCA purchased the rights to the name in 1986.

===2014 logo===
[[File:World trade center 2014 logo detail.png|150px|frameless|right]]
The World Trade Center's new logo, revealed in August 2014, was designed by the firm [[Landor Associates]] and shaped like a "W". All the black bars, the empty spaces, and the "W" itself symbolize something, giving the logo at least six meanings:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-15/the-world-trade-centers-new-logo-has-at-least-six-meanings|title=Six Meanings Behind the World Trade Center’s New Logo|author=Belinda Lanks|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>

*The top half of the logo features bars cut off at a 17.76-degree angle, evoking One World Trade Center's 1,776-foot height.<ref name=Wilson-logo/><ref name=Dunlap-Logo/>

*The two black bars at the bottom also stand for the twin pools of the [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|9/11 Memorial]].<ref name=Wilson-logo/><ref name=Dunlap-Logo/>
*The logo, as a whole, is in the shape of a "W", which stands for "World Trade Center" and "[[Westfield World Trade Center]]".<ref name=Wilson-logo>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Mark|title=The World Trade Center Has A New, Very Confusing Logo|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034384/the-world-trade-center-has-a-new-very-confusing-logo|accessdate=August 14, 2014|publisher=Fast Company|date=August 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Dunlap-Logo/>

Landor Associates was awarded a $3.57 million contract in 2013 to design the logo. Douglas Riccardi, the principal in the design firm Memo, stated, "Its strength is its ability to be seen in many ways. You could never get more meaning in five little bars. The problem is that people may not bother to find out what the meanings are."<ref name=Dunlap-Logo>{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=David|title=World Trade Center Logo Captures Site’s Destruction and Rebirth|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/nyregion/world-trade-center-logo-captures-sites-destruction-and-rebirth.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 14, 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

==={{anchor|Controversy and criticism}} Early controversy and criticism===

There was much debate regarding the future of [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] following the destruction of the World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property and what would be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but stronger and taller. This movement was led by an informal organization called the ''Twin Towers Alliance''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twintowersalliance.com/|title=The Twin Towers Alliance|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref> Others did not want anything built there at all or wanted the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Handwerker |first=Haim |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/925885.html |title=The politics of remembering Ground Zero – Haaretz – Israel News |work=Haaretz |date=November 20, 2007 }}</ref>

The social center of the old World Trade Center included a restaurant on the 107th floor, called [[Windows on the World]], and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/09/wotw.php|title=Windows on the World, New York's Sky-High Restaurant - Eater NY|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/world-trade-center-observatory-views-photos_n_3001052.html | work=Huffington Post | title=PHOTOS: The Stunning Views Atop One World Trade Center | date=April 2, 2013}}</ref> This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called "Windows on the World Wine School", run by wine personality [[Kevin Zraly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/windows-on-the-world-september-11|title=Windows on the World September 11 - A 9/11 Story About Wine and Wisdom - Esquire|work=Esquire|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref> Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20010917/SUB/109170715#|title=Owner vows to reopen Windows On The World|date=September 17, 2001|work=Crain's New York Business|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref> the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.<ref>{{cite news|journal=Gothamist|date=March 8, 2011|title=WTC Scraps Windows on the World Plan|url=http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/wtc_scraps_windows_on_the_world_pla.php}}</ref>

An episode of [[CBS]]'s ''60 Minutes'' in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center's having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved.  Investor [[Larry Silverstein]] said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero "is still a hole in the ground". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: "I am the most frustrated person in the world.&hellip;I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6220282.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody|title=Developer: Ground Zero a National Disgrace - 60 Minutes: Eight Years and Billions of Dollars Later, Part of 9/11 Site is Still Just a Big Hole|publisher=CBS News|date=February 18, 2010|page=1}}</ref>

[[One World Trade Center]] itself was met with criticism early in its planning and construction stages.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/18/wtc.trump/ |publisher=CNN | title=Trump pushes own Ground Zero plan | date=May 19, 2005}}</ref> The original design, which was asymmetrical, significantly shorter, and called for an off-center spire, was met with much disapproval, causing a new one to be devised. A key feature of the final design, the fortified, windowless base, was also denounced as looking dreary and unwelcoming.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/world-trade-center-update_n_860992.html "Prismatic glass façade for WTC tower scrapped"]. ''Huffington Post''. May 12, 2011. Retrieved June 19, 2011.</ref> To alleviate this problem, the designers decided to clad it with prismatic glass panels. Since the failure of that plan, it is now unclear what the base will be covered with. The name change from ''Freedom Tower'' to ''One World Trade Center'' was met with some criticism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,511278,00.html|title=Freedom Tower Name Change Slammed as Unpatriotic|date=March 28, 2009 |work=Fox News.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The then-[[Governor of New York]], [[George Pataki]], stated in 2003 that "[t]he Freedom Tower isn't going to be One World Trade Center, it's going to be the Freedom Tower."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/14660/ |title=Freedom Tower Renaming Draws Criticism |date=April 2, 2009 |first=Charlotte |last=Cuthbertson |publisher=The Epoch Times |accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref>
