{{main|Grammy Award}}
The Grammy Awards have been held in many prestigious locations. In 1971 the Grammy Awards had its first live telecast and therefore had its own sole venue each year for the telecast. From 1963 to 1970 the Academy aired a TV special annually called "The Best On Record" which highlighted the awards dinners. Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have been held in the [[Staples Center]] located in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].

==Non-televised era==
From 1959 to 1970 Awards dinners were held in the following locations simultaneously on the same day:
*1959–1961: [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]]
*1962–1964: [[Chicago]], Los Angeles and New York
*1965–1970: Chicago, Los Angeles, [[Nashville]] and New York

It was the primary [[Los Angeles]] venue for the Grammy Awards from 1978 until the completion of the [[Staples Center]], which is where the Grammy Awards now take place. Los Angeles has held a total of 31 Grammy telecasts. The last time the Grammy Awards took place outside of Los Angeles was in 2003.
