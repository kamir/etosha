==History==
The university was founded as ''Lynchburg Baptist College'' in 1971 by [[Jerry Falwell]], who was also Senior Pastor of [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]]. The name was changed to ''Liberty Baptist College'' in 1976 before settling on its current name, ''Liberty University'', in 1984, when it obtained [[university]] status.

Liberty University describes itself as a Christian academic community. Its stated mission and aims emphasize both the intellectual and spiritual development of the institution's students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=6899|title=About Liberty - Purpose/Mission|accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> Students are held to ''The Liberty Way'', a code of conduct.

===Main, East and North campuses===
Liberty University's Campus East housing complex consists of 30 multi-story apartment style [[dormitories]], the last six of which were completed in 2007. Rooms in these dormitories have their own kitchens, [[living room]] and private baths. A [[Community centre|clubhouse]] offers a [[swimming pool]], [[billiards]] room, and a private theater. A tunnel connecting the east and west ends of the campus was completed in 2004. A second tunnel was completed in May 2014, and provides pedestrian passage under the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and access to nearby shopping opportunities. In addition, a campus bus/shuttle system was added in the fall of 2006, providing transportation both on and off campus until midnight most evenings.

The {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} LaHaye Student Center, has a lounge, basketball courts, cardio and weight rooms, cafe, multi-purpose rooms, aerobic rooms and other amenities.<ref>[http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=7014 LaHaye Student Center - Official Page - Liberty University]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> The adjacent Tilley Center has TV lounges, game tables, pool room, and social areas, as well as a stage for student performances, bands and small concerts. Other projects include a {{convert|60|mi|adj=on}} [[mountain bike]] trail system, a [[motorcross]] facility, [[paintball]] fields, 3D [[archery]] range, intramural sports program and club sports, including lacrosse and [[ice hockey]], which plays in an ice rink donated by Drs. [[Tim LaHaye|Tim]] and [[Beverly LaHaye]], and a new indoor soccer facility.

During the spring of 2007, a secondary practice facility for the Liberty volleyball program was opened as part of a new, on-campus training complex. The existing $750,000 facility on Campus East houses the volleyball coaches’ offices and a team room, and serves as the team’s practice facility whenever the Vines Center and Schilling Center are unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertyflames.com/index.cfm?PID=21864 |title=Volleyball - Campus East Volleyball Facility |publisher=Liberty Flames |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref>

On September 24, 2010, Liberty opened the new Tower Theater, with seating for up to 640 people.  For the 2010-11 theater season, the Theater Department opened with ''Hairspray,'' and closed in Spring 2011 with ''The Phantom of the Opera.'' The theatre includes balcony seating, an orchestra pit, catwalks, a fly tower, a box office and {{convert|12000|sqft}} of support area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=19836 |title=BUILDING UP: Construction projects keep campus abuzz this summer &#124; Liberty University |publisher=Liberty.edu |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref> The tower was originally part of a cell phone plant.

In August 2011, Liberty announced a 120 million dollar campus expansion. The expansion includes more dorms, greener space, and more academic buildings allowing the campus to hold 20,000 resident students.<ref name="liberty1">{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=37241 |title=Campus transformation planned &#124; Liberty University |publisher=Liberty.edu |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref>

In January 2012, Liberty University's Department of Theatre Arts announced the formation of a professional theater company to occupy the Tower Theater. The Alluvion Stage Company will hire professional actors to perform alongside the students, and the sets and costumes will meet professional standards. Department Chair Linda Nell Cooper said about the new company: "Alluvion, meaning overflow, will aim to enrich, educate and entertain the community by providing a superior theater experience in a wholesome family environment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=45653 |title=Theatre Arts Department launches professional stage company &#124; Liberty University |publisher=Liberty.edu |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref>

Liberty University is scheduled to open a new Observatory Center in the Spring of 2013 next to Liberty's Equestrian Center.  Lee Beaumont, Vice President of Auxiliary Services, says this dome will be a classroom that can fit up to 20 people.

====National Civil War Chaplains Museum====
The National Civil War Chaplains Museum contains exhibits of clergy members and religious activity during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era.  It is the only [[museum]] in the nation devoted to this purpose.  The mission of the museum is to “educate the public about the role of [[chaplains]], [[priests]], and [[rabbis]] and religious organizations in the Civil War; to promote the continuing study of the many methods of dissemination of religious doctrine and moral teachings during the War; to preserve religious [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and to present interpretive programs that show the influence of religion on the lives of political and military personnel.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaplainsmuseum.org/i/?page_id=166 |title=We'll Be Back! |publisher=Chaplainsmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref> A 501(c)(3) organization, the museum rents space from Liberty University’s DeMoss Center. It has 10,000 square feet, with a 50-seat video theatre, archive displays, a research library, and book store.

The museum features [[Catholic]], [[Protestant]], [[Jewish]] chaplains (including [[African American]] chaplains), publications, and artifacts from both the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] militaries. There are several areas in the museum that are given special attention including:
*The role of the [[United States Christian Commission]], which is the forerunner to today’s [[USO]] and [[Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverlynchburg.org/220_attractions_national-civil-war-chaplains-museum |title=Local Attractions, National Civil War Chaplains Museum |publisher=Discover Lynchburg |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref>

Two new exhibits have been added to the museum as of 2012: "a “mourning room” with period furniture and decorations (including a cross formed from the woven hair of dead Confederate soldiers), and an exhibit on Civil War sharpshooters featuring Rev. Lorenzo Barbour, chaplain to the Confederate Berdan’s Sharpshooters."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2012/may/23/darrell-laurant-civil-war-chaplain-museum-feature--ar-1938538/ |title=Darrell Laurant: Civil War chaplain museum to feature two new exhibits &#124; The News & Advance |publisher=.newsadvance.com |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref>

In September 2012, Liberty University hosted the 16th annual Civil War Seminar. Titled "1862-The Rise of Lee and Grant", the seminar featured presentations on many different Civil War issues, highlighted by lectures on Grant's Mississippi and Vicksburg Campaigns and Lee's Seven Days' Campaign. The event also featured an online simulation of the Battle of Antietam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=64555 |title=Liberty to host 2012 Civil War Seminar &#124; Liberty University |publisher=Liberty.edu |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref>

====Carter Glass Mansion====
The Carter Glass Mansion is a historic home originally built in 1923 by U.S. Senator [[Carter Glass]] a newspaper publisher, politician and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Woodrow Wilson as well as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and President Pro Tempore of the Senate during President Roosevelt's era.<ref name="dhr.virginia.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Lynchburg/118-0210_Montview_1987_Final_Nomination.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Register of Historic Place : Inventory - Nomination Form |publisher=Dhr.virginia.gov |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref> Also known as Montview, the mansion is part of the National Register of Historic Places and is a state landmark. The {{convert|1.7|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate consists of a {{frac|1|1|2}}-story main building flanked by slightly smaller ells. The {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} walls are constructed of quartz fieldstone quarried from the property and the mansion is covered with a grey gambrel roof.<ref name="dhr.virginia.gov"/> The estate was purchased by Liberty University in the late 1970s as the headquarters of the university administration, including the main office of university founder Jerry Falwell. One of the many reasons for the estate’s continued fame is that Falwell died at his desk at the Carter Glass Mansion on May 15, 2007, and his office has been preserved in the same condition ever since. Falwell was buried on the lawn of the mansion and a memorial to Falwell was placed there, overlooking the rest of the campus. The estate now serves mostly as a tourist site for the historically restored mansion as well as the Falwell office, while the upstairs portion of the mansion has been converted to a bed and breakfast for Liberty University guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2008/may/15/falwells_family_preserving_his_office_at_carter_gl-ar-224228/ |title=Falwell's family preserving his office at Carter Glass mansion &#124; The News & Advance |publisher=.newsadvance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref>

===School of Music===
In September 2012, Liberty University announced that it will be combining the Department of Music and Humanities with the Department of Worship and Music Studies to form a new School of Music. The school of music will have 32 full-time and 24 adjunct faculty members separated into two distinct centers. The Center for Music and Performing Arts will focus on music education and performance technique, while the Center for Music and Worship will seek to train skilled musicians as worship leaders and specialists within the Christian music industry. The School of Music will be located in a new building being constructed across from the Arthur S. DeMoss Learning Center.

===Liberty University Online===
Liberty University has an internet education component which is called LU Online, previously the Distance Learning Program (DLP). Prior to the launch of its online education component in 2009, Liberty University provided adult learning courses through the LU School of Lifelong Learning (LUSLLL) by way of its External Degree Program. The LUSLLL was Liberty University's fastest growing school at the time with Jerry Falwell forecasting in his 1997 autobiography an enrollment of 40,000 students in the early 21st Century with the expectation of an addition 10,000 students studying on campus at the same time. Both expectations have been surpassed by current enrollment figures. Liberty's online component currently provides degrees from Associates level to Doctorate. The online school runs unilaterally with the semester program offered at Liberty University's campus. One difference with LU Online is that students take 16-week (full semester) classes for a few of their cataloged courses while the remainder are taken in 8-week subterms which are titled B, C, and D. These subterms provide the student with scheduling flexibility through shorter, slightly overlapping sessions. There is a separation at the 600-level and above at which courses are only offered in the B and D terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luonline.com/index.cfm?PID=14238 |title=Academic Calendar &#124; Liberty University Online|publisher=Luonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref> LU Online promotes teacher/student discourse through interactive online discussions and class size limits (capped at 25 students).<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/virginias-liberty-transforms-into-evangelical-mega-university/2013/03/04/931cb116-7d09-11e2-9a75-dab0201670da_story_2.html |title=Virginia’s Liberty transforms into evangelical mega-university |publisher=The Washington Post |date= 2013-03-05|accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref> Liberty University reports that enrollment for their online program is six times greater than their residential enrollment, with about 80,000 of their 92,500 total students enrolled online.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liberty University Quick Facts|url=http://www.liberty.edu/aboutliberty/index.cfm?PID=6925|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

==Finances==
In May 2012, Liberty University Chancellor and President Jerry Falwell Jr announced that the school's net assets are worth $1 billion, in part from the success of its online learning program and from accelerated facility expansion.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/><ref name="www2.newsadvance.com"/> This valuation is a 10-fold increase since 2006 and underscores the rapid expansion the university has recently experienced.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>

==Controversy==

===1989 bond issue===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
In 1989, Liberty University applied for $60 million in low interest bonds through the Lynchburg Industrial Development Authority. After the required public hearing period the bond issue was voted upon by the IDA and approved. Shortly thereafter litigation was brought against the IDA and Liberty University by [[Americans United]] (AU) and a decision (Habel vs. Lynchburg Industrial Development Authority) was handed down in 1991 denying Liberty the bond issuance. It was ruled that Liberty was too pervasively religious and therefore was not eligible for the bonds.

This case dealt a severe financial blow to the university which was unable to fund its construction projects needed to sustain its rapid growth. A subsequent case a few years later involving [[Regent University]] was decided in a similar manner, but was later overturned. The Virginia Supreme Court reviewed the case and based its decision on a more recent US Supreme Court ruling concerning issues of Separation and Sectarianism. Since then, Regent has received approval for bond funding with the stipulation that it may not fund the Divinity School.

===1994 debt buy-out===
[[Sun Myung Moon]], [[cult]] founder of the [[Unification Church]] and the ''[[Washington Times]]'', and his wife [[Hak Ja Han]] helped to financially stabilize the university through two of his organizations: [[News World Communications]] (an international media firm which publishes the ''Washington Times'' and other news media), which provided a $400,000 loan to the university at 6% interest; and the [[Women's Federation for World Peace]], which indirectly contributed $3.5 million toward the school's debt.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/main.htm|title=A Church in Flux Is Flush With Cash|publisher=Washington Post|date=November 23, 1997|first= Marc|last= Fisher|accessdate = 2007-11-14}} "Also in 1995, the Women's Federation made another donation that illustrates how Moon supports fellow conservatives. It gave a $3.5 million grant to the Christian Heritage Foundation, which later bought a large portion of Liberty University's debt, rescuing the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Lynchburg, Va., religious school from the brink of bankruptcy."</ref> Liberty University spokesman Mark DeMoss said the school was not aware of News World's connection to Moon when it obtained the loan through a broker. "I'm not going to be pious and tell you we would have turned it down," DeMoss said. "Because it was a business transaction, we probably would have moved forward even if Falwell or somebody in the organization knew who News World Communications was."<ref name="Washington Post"/> Liberty University founder Jerry Falwell stated that the source of the funds does not influence his ministry: "If the [[American Atheists|American Atheists Society]] or [[Saddam Hussein]] himself ever sent an unrestricted gift to any of my ministries, be assured I will operate on [[Billy Sunday]]'s philosophy: The Devil's had it long enough, and quickly cash the check."<ref name="Christian Today">{{cite news|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/1998/february9/8t2082.html|title=Finance: Moon-Related Funds Filter to Evangelicals|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|date=February 9, 1998|first=John|last=Kennedy|accessdate=2007-10-30}} "$3.5 MILLION GIFT: In November, the Los Angeles Times reported that the [[Women's Federation for World Peace]] (WFWP), which is headed by Moon's wife, contributed $3.5 million to Christian Heritage Foundation (CHF) of Virginia for "educational purposes" in 1995."</ref>

===Biology===
Liberty University teaches [[young Earth creationism]] as an explanation for the appearance of life on earth. The university works with young Earth creationist organizations including [[Answers in Genesis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2007/07/31/liberty-university-scholarship-awarded-to-aig-research-paper-winner|title=Liberty University scholarship awarded to AiG research paper winner|accessdate=7 January 2009|last=Ham|first=Ken|date=31 July 2007|publisher=Answers in Genesis}}/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2006/05/14/graduation-day-at-liberty-university/|title=Graduation day at Liberty University|accessdate=7 January 2009|last=Ham|first=Ken|date=14 May 2006|publisher=Answers in Genesis}}</ref> In biology classes students are taught both [[creationism]] and [[evolution]] and that [[creationism]] offers a better explanation of biological diversity than [[biological evolution|evolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/article_6ac02b19-bedc-5184-8097-32c25dc66aa5.html|title=Liberty University disputing evolution|accessdate=10 June 2009|last=Desrets |first=Christa|date=14 February 2009|publisher=The News & Advance}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/AR2009031003690.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Creationist Students Take Trip to Evolution Headquarters: The Smithsonian|first=Steve|last=Hendrix|date=2009-03-11|accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> In October, 2006 the university published an advertisement in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] in an attempt to recruit staff to its biology department. The advertisement stated that the university was "seeking faculty who can demonstrate a personal faith commitment to its evangelical Christian purpose" and specified that "compatibility with a young-earth creationist philosophy [is] required."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/290-liberty-university-is-looking-for-biology-professors|title=Liberty University is looking for Biology Professors|accessdate=17 March 2014|date=6 November 2006|publisher=Richarddawkins.net}}</ref>

In the same month, prominent biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] was quoted saying the following about Liberty University: "If it's really true that the museum at Liberty University has dinosaur fossils which are labeled as being 3,000 years old, then that is an educational disgrace. It is debauching the whole idea of a university, and I would strongly encourage any members of Liberty University who may be here, to leave and go to a proper university."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL4qEtTu2Yk|title=Richard Dawkins Slams Liberty University|accessdate=2014-11-09}}</ref> In December, 1991 ''Creation'' reported, Arlton C.

===Political clubs===
On May 15, 2009, vice president of student affairs Mark Hine sent an e-mail to the president of LU's [[College Democrats]], Brian Diaz, revoking the university's recognition of the club. "The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] platform is contrary to the mission of Liberty University and to [[Christian]] doctrine", Hine's e-mail stated, citing the party's positions on [[abortion]] and federal funding thereof, [[same-sex marriage]], [[hate crimes]], [[LGBT]] rights, and [[socialism]] as justification for the dissolution. While the club can still meet on campus, it cannot use the university's name or reserve university facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/lna/news/local/article/lu_pulls_plug_on_democratic_club/16172/ |title=LU pulls plug on Democratic club|last=Reed|first=Ray|date=2009-05-21|publisher=www.newsadvance.com/ |accessdate =2009-05-21}}</ref>

At a meeting with administration officials, the group was asked to apologize publicly for statements they had made to the media about this controversy. Diaz said he was baffled by the administration's decision, saying, "I want to be able to share the love of Christ, but I guess I can't do that on campus because I'm a Democrat as well."<ref>[http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2009/05/mcauliffe_jumps.php] {{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

Chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]] and Democratic ex-governor [[Tim Kaine]] and [[Virginia gubernatorial election, 2009|2009 Democratic gubernatorial candidates]] [[Terry McAuliffe]], [[Brian Moran]] and [[Creigh Deeds]] called on the college to rescind the ban.<ref name=wp>{{cite news |title=Liberty U.

Liberty's decision led some to question the university's tax-exempt status, and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] filed a complaint with the [[Internal Revenue Service]], asking for a review of the university's tax status. Liberty University in turn filed a complaint with the IRS regarding the tax-exempt status of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2009/06/questioning-liberty-universitys-taxexempt-status.html|title=Questioning Liberty University's Tax-Exempt Status}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ombwatch.org/node/10060|title=Liberty U Drops Recognition of Democratic Club; Falwell Files Complaint Against AU|date=2009-06-01|publisher=OMB Watch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lc.org/media/9980/attachments/ltr_au_%20irs_w_media_exhibits.pdf |format=PDF |title=Liberty Counsel |publisher=Lc.org|accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

In late June 2009, Liberty University announced a new policy dealing with all political clubs on campus. The new policy removed official recognition from all political clubs on campus, relegating them to unofficial status. President Falwell said the previously suspended College Democrats "wouldn’t have to do anything" to be recognized under the new policy. Along with other stipulations, the policy allows unofficial clubs to use the university's name, but they will not receive any funding from the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsls.com/sls/news/local/lynchburg/article/liberty_university_implements_new_political_club_policy/39575/ |title=Liberty U. implements new club policy June 22, 2009 |publisher=Wsls.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref> In response, Kaine said Liberty University solved the controversy "perfectly".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/lna/news/local/article/kaine_liberty_solved_club_controversy_perfectly/17247/ |title=Kaine: Liberty solved club controversy 'perfectly' |publisher=The News & Advance |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-12-17}} {{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>
