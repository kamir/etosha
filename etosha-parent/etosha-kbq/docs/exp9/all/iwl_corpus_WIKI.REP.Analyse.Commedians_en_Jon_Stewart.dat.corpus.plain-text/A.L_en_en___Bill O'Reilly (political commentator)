==Broadcasting career==
===Early career===
O'Reilly's early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at [[WNEP-TV]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], Pennsylvania, where he also reported the weather. At [[WFAA-TV]] in [[Dallas]], O'Reilly was awarded the Dallas Press Club Award for excellence in [[investigative journalism|investigative reporting]]. He then moved to [[KMGH-TV]] in [[Denver]], where he won a local [[Emmy Award]] for his coverage of a [[skyjacking]].<ref name=FoxBio1>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155,00.html Bill O'Reilly's Bio] ''Accessed August 2006''</ref> O'Reilly also worked for [[KATU]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, [[WFSB]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut, and WNEV-TV (now [[WHDH-TV]]) in Boston.

In 1980 O'Reilly anchored the local news-feature program ''7:30 Magazine'' at [[WCBS-TV]] in New York. Soon after, as a WCBS News anchor and correspondent, he won his second local Emmy, for an investigation of corrupt city marshals. In 1982 he was promoted to the network as a [[CBS News]] correspondent.

For CBS, O'Reilly covered the wars in [[El Salvador]] on location,  and in the [[Falkland Islands]] from his base in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. O'Reilly left CBS over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by [[Bob Schieffer]] of footage of a riot in response to the military junta's surrender, shot by O'Reilly's crew in Buenos Aires shortly after the conclusion of the war.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/27/060327fa_fact "Fear Factor – Bill O'Reilly's baroque period"], Nicholas Lemann, ''The New Yorker'', March 20, 2006</ref><ref name="motherjones1">[http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/david-corn-response-oreilly-falklands "How Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has mischaracterized his wartime reporting experience."], David Corn, ''Mother Jones'', February 20, 2015</ref>

In 1986, O'Reilly joined [[ABC News]] as a correspondent. He had delivered a eulogy for his friend Joe Spencer, an ABC News correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on January 22, 1986, en route to covering the [[Hormel]] meatpacker strike.  ABC News president [[Roone Arledge]], who attended Spencer's funeral, decided to hire O'Reilly after hearing the eulogy.<ref>Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', pp. 123–124.</ref> At ABC, O'Reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day's ''[[World News with Diane Sawyer|World News Tonight]]'' and worked as a general assignment reporter for ABC News programs, including ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'', and ''World News Tonight''.<ref>Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', pp. 127.</ref>

O'Reilly has said that his interest and style in media came from several CBS and ABC personalities, including [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Dick Snyder]] and [[Peter Jennings]].{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===''Inside Edition''===
{{main|Inside Edition}}
In 1989 O'Reilly joined the nationally [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[King World]] (now [[CBS Television Distribution]])-produced ''[[Inside Edition]]'', a tabloid/gossip television program in competition with ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]''.<ref name="Fox News Bio"/> He became the program's anchor three weeks into its run, after the termination of original anchor [[David Frost]].<ref>Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', p. 137.</ref> In addition to being one of the first American broadcasters to cover the dismantling of the [[Berlin Wall]], O'Reilly also obtained the first exclusive interview with murderer [[Joel Steinberg]] and was the first television host from a national current affairs program on the scene of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].

Former [[NBC News]] and [[CBS News]] anchor [[Deborah Norville]] replaced O'Reilly on ''Inside Edition'' in 1995; O'Reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in July 1994.<ref>Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', p. 148.</ref> He then enrolled in September 1995 at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard University,<ref>Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', p. 150.</ref> where he received a master's degree in public administration.<ref name="Fox News Bio"/> His graduate thesis, which he researched in Singapore, was titled ''Theory of Coerced Drug Rehabilitation''. In his thesis, O'Reilly asserted that supervised mandatory drug rehabilitation would reduce crime, based on the rate of prison return for criminals in [[Alabama]] who enrolled in such a program.<ref>Kitman, ''The Man Who Would Not Shut Up'', pp. 154–155.</ref>

===''The O'Reilly Factor''===
{{Main|The O'Reilly Factor}}

O'Reilly's life and career have not been without controversy. [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] media watchdog organizations such as [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] and [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] have criticized O'Reilly's reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics.<ref name="fair.org">{{cite web|last=Hart |first=Peter |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1108 |title=Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting, "The "Oh Really?"

After the [[September 11 attacks]], O'Reilly accused the [[United Way of America]] and [[American Red Cross]] of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks.<ref>[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25667 "Fight the power"], Bill O'Reilly, WorldNetDaily, December 13, 2001</ref> O'Reilly reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims.

In early 2007, researchers from the [[Indiana University]] School of Journalism published a report that analyzed O'Reilly's "Talking Points Memo" segment.

On May 10, 2008, O'Reilly was presented with the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] Governors' Award at an [[Emmy]] awards show dinner.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horton|first=Scott|title=How Bill O'Reilly Got a Critic Fired|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/08/hbc-90007521|newspaper=Harper's Magazine|date=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Disputed claims===
====George de Mohrenschildt claim====
In his bestselling 2013 book ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'' and on ''Fox and Friends'', O'Reilly claimed he was knocking at the front door of [[George de Mohrenschildt]]'s daughter's home at the moment Mohrenschildt committed suicide and that he heard the shotgun blast:

<blockquote>In March of 1977, a young television reporter at WFAA in Dallas began looking in to the Kennedy assassination. As part of his reporting, he sought an interview with the shadowy Russian professor who had befriended the Oswalds upon their arrival in Dallas in 1962. The reporter traced George de Mohrenschildt to Palm Beach, Florida and travelled there to confront him. At the time de Mohrenschildt had been called to testify before a congressional committee looking into the events of November, 1963. As the reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt’s daughter’s home, he heard the shotgun blast [Emphasis added] that marked the suicide of the Russian, assuring that his relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald would never be fully understood.

By the way, that reporter’s name is Bill O’Reilly.</blockquote>

This claim has been disputed by former ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor Jefferson Morley, who cites audio recordings made by [[Gaeton Fonzi]] indicating O'Reilly was not present in Florida on the day of Mohrenschildt's suicide.<ref name="jfkf_JFKf">{{Cite web | title = JFKfacts » Investigator’s tape exposes Bill O’Reilly’s JFK fib | author = Jeff Morley | work = JFK Facts | date = January 30, 2013 | accessdate = 2015-03-10 | url = http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/news/reporters-tape-exposes-bill-oreillys-jfk-fib/ | quote =  }}</ref><ref name="mone_Bill">{{Cite web | title = Bill O'Reilly faces new questions: His JFK story | last = Kludt | first = Tom | work = CNNMoney | date = 25 February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-10 | url = http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/25/media/bill-oreilly-jfk-george-de-mohrenschildt/ | language =   | quote =  }}</ref>

On February 20, 2015, O'Reilly said on his show "David Corn, a liar, says that I exaggerated situations in the Falklands War" and that he never said he was on the Falkland Islands.

Covered from Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Then I went to Israel and covered that. And then I went to Northern Island and covered that. So I've seen the best and the worst and I know the worst. LEMMA: At times dangerous situations. O'REILLY: Yes, it was dangerous. I almost got killed a couple of times. LEMMA: Is there one situation in particular.. O'REILLY: When the Argentines surrendered to the British, there were riots in the streets of Buenos Aires. I wrote about this in my novel ''Those who Trespass''. And I was out there, pretty much by myself because the other CBS News Correspondents were hiding in the Hotel. And I said "why you guys.. you gotta get out and cover the story"..which I did. But, when the riots broke out, in the Casa Rosada, that's where the presidential palace is, people were kind of storming the presidential palace because they were so angry that they have lost face, that they have lost to the British. So there must have been 5,000 or 6,000 people. And the army was standing between the people and the presidential palace. Here in United States we would do tear gas and rubber bullets. They were doing real bullets. They were just gunning these people down. Shoot them down on the streets. LEMMA: So you could have gotten killed. O'REILLY: I was there watching this from about 15 feet away from where the army was shooting. And you got to understand it. When you are in El Salvador, or Argentina or even Northern Island you are on your own. There is no Americans. So when I went to Afghanistan and Iraq, with The Factor, we had guys. We had American guys with us, wherever we were. We were in some dangerous places but we had American soldiers around us. When I was down there, you are by yourself. Nobody is gonna help you. So anyway, when the riots broke out, my shooter, my photographer, got run over by the crowd. Got trampled by the crowd and the camera went flying. I saved the tape, because it was unbelievable tape. But I dragged him off the street. Because he was bleeding from the ear and had hit his head on the concrete. So I dragged him off the street with one hand, and I got the tape with the other hand. The soundman is trying to save the camera, because CBS would not gonna be happy to loose a camera, they are expensive. And then the army comes running down and the guy points the M-16 at our..

I wasn't begging, you beg and you are in trouble.(...)"}}</ref> This is consistent with ''Mother Jones'' report claiming that he was in Buenos Aires but not in the Falkland Islands, but not with his own 2013 claim that he was "in the Falklands".

During an interview with [[The Blaze]], O'Reilly said "And if that moron [Corn] doesn’t think it was a war zone in Buenos Aires, then he’s even dumber than I think he is."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/20/bill-oreilly-falkland-islands-war-exaggeration-accusations-mother-jones |title=Bill O'Reilly calls accusations of exaggerated war reporting 'total bullshit'  |first=Tom |last=McCarthy |publisher=The Guardian |date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> This characterization by O'Reilly was disputed by former CBS colleague [[Eric Engberg]] who was in Buenos Aires at the time and challenged his (O'Reilly) description of the riot as a "combat situation".

The video appears to show riot police firing tear gas and plastic bullets toward the crowd, additionally former NBC bureau chief [[Don Browne]] referred to the riot as an “intense situation”, with many people hurt and [[tank]]s in the streets of Buenos Aires.<ref> {{cite web|url= http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/02/24/cbs-news-releases-video-falklands-war-riots/ |title= CBS News releases video of the Falklands War riots |publisher= foxnews.com |date=|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>

The fallout from the coverage generated by the questioning of O'Reilly's Falklands War coverage saw claims made by O'Reilly made regarding his reporting in El Salvador and Northern Ireland questioned.  Writing in his 2013 book ''Keep it Pithy'', O'Reilly stated: "I've seen soldiers gun down unarmed civilians in Latin America, Irish terrorists kill and maim their fellow citizens in Belfast with bombs." In 2005 O'Reilly claimed to have "seen guys gun down nuns in El Salvador" and in 2012 said "I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head". O'Reilly and Fox News clarified that he had been shown images of the murdered nuns and Irish bombings but was not an eyewitness in either case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Buzz/2015/0302/Bill-O-Reilly-lied-says-Fox-News-Why-that-won-t-hurt-him-at-Fox|title= Bill O'Reilly lied, says Fox News: Why that won't hurt him at Fox|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/is-bill-oreilly-making-things-up-or-just-bloviating/2015/02/27/bd5e7f66-bea4-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html|title= Bill O’Reilly cites conflicts that he witnessed.

=== Sexual harassment lawsuit ===
On October 13, 2004, O'Reilly sued Andrea Mackris, a former producer for ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', with extortion charges, alleging that she had threatened a lawsuit unless he paid her more than $60&nbsp;million. Subsequently that day, Mackris sued O'Reilly for [[sexual harassment]], seeking $60&nbsp;million in damages. Her lawsuit alleged two types of legally-cognizable sexual harassment claims that are not based upon physical contact: ''[[quid pro quo]]'' and ''[[hostile work environment]]''. In her lawsuit, she filed a 22-page complaint with the Supreme Court of the State of New York,<ref name=Mackris_complaint>{{cite web  |url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/oreilly-hit-sex-harass-suit |title = O'Reilly Sex Harassment Suit: Andrea Mackris 22 page complaint filed with the New York Supreme Court.

The person gets what's coming to them but never sees it coming." On October 15, 2004, Fox sought judicial permission to fire Mackris, but she was never dismissed. On October 19, 2004, Mackris filed an amended complaint seeking further damages for illegal retaliatory actions by O'Reilly, Fox News, and the [[News Corporation]]-owned newspaper the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref name=TSG>{{cite web  |url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/funny/oreilly-hit-sex-harass-suit |title = O'Reilly Hit With Sex Harass Suit: Female coworker details lewd behavior of Fox News star |publisher = [[Courtroom Television Network]] LLC |work = [[The Smoking Gun]]|date = October 13, 2004 |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref> On October 28, 2004, O'Reilly and Mackris reached an [[out-of-court settlement]] and dropped all charges against each other. According to several published reports, as part of the settlement O'Reilly likely paid Mackris millions of dollars, but the terms of the agreement are confidential.<ref name="settleoct28">{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7578-2004Oct28.html |title = Bill O'Reilly, Producer Settle Harassment Suit |accessdate = February 12, 2011 |author = Howard Kurtz |authorlink = Howard Kurtz |date = October 29, 2004 |work = The Washington Post}}</ref>

==Public disputes==

===Ludacris===
On August 27, 2002, O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott [[Pepsi]] products,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Noah |first=Timothy |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2078577/ |title=Whopper of the Week: Bill O'Reilly. – By Timothy Noah – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=February 14, 2003 |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> saying that [[Ludacris]]' lyrics glamorize a "life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28916 |title=Singing a different tune |publisher=Worldnetdaily.com |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Three years later, Ludacris referenced O'Reilly in the song "[[Number One Spot]]" with the lyrics  "Respected highly, hi, Mr. O'Reilly/Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey.", which alludes to his well publicized sexual harassment suit while married. In an interview with [[RadarOnline.com]] in 2010, Ludacris stated that the two had made amends after a conversation at a charity event.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harling |first=Danielle |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10814/title.ludacris-and-bill-oreilly-make-amends |title=Ludacris And Bill O'Reilly Make Amends |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Joy Behar/Whoopi Goldberg===
On October 14, 2010, [[Joy Behar]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]] walked off the set of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' after they both disagreed with statements made by O'Reilly, specifically O'Reilly's statement "Muslims killed us on 9/11."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25uyFwWPOZg |title=YouTube – Bill O'Reilly Gets Whoopi Goldberg & Joy Behar to Walk Off The View |publisher=YouTube |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110728155856/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25uyFwWPOZg| archivedate= July 28, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Goldberg stated O'Reilly should be more specific than just labeling Muslims. O'Reilly defended his statement citing the lack of specificity when describing attacks by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]] in [[World War II]]. O'Reilly later explained on his show that the statement was valid when he said "Of course, what I said is absolutely true, but is insensitive to some. In a perfect world you always say Muslim terrorists killed us, but at this point I thought that was common knowledge. I guess I was wrong."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/transcript/muslim-dilemma | title=The Muslim Dilemma – Talking Points – The O'Reilly Factor | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> [[Barbara Walters]] disagreed with O'Reilly's defense of the World War II comparison stating that describing a religion is not the same as describing a country. Walters would go on to say, "We should be able to have discussion without&nbsp;... walking off stage."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hammel |first=Sara |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20434198,00.html |title=VIDEO: Whoopi Goldberg & Joy Behar Storm Off The View – The View, Bill O'Reilly, Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg |work=People |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> Former host and progressive commentator [[Rosie O'Donnell]] stated on her radio program that the incident was an example of what she viewed as regular hateful statements. O'Reilly responded by citing O'Donnell's earlier statement about claiming the threat from radical Christianity is similar to that of radical Islam.

===Anti-Defamation League===
On December 8, 2004, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) sent O'Reilly a letter criticizing him for making remarks offensive towards Jews on his radio talk show ''The Radio Factor''.<ref name="2004 ADF letter to Bill O'Reilly">{{cite web|last=Foxman|first=Abraham|title=ADL Letter to The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly|url=http://archive.adl.org/media_watch/radio/radiofactor_120804.html#.U0NLt_ldX_E|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The group found issue with his response to the call of a Jewish listener named "Joel", who complained of Christian proselytizing through the celebration of Christmas in public schools, which included O'Reilly stating that:<blockquote>Overwhelmingly, America is Christian. And the holiday is a federal holiday honoring the philosopher Jesus. So you don't wanna hear about it?  Impossible … if you are really offended you gotta go to Israel, then.<ref name="SunTimes">{{cite web|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne|title=Christian Might Doesn't Make Right|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-12-23/lifestyle/0412210486_1_television-and-religion-bill-o-reilly-parents-television-council|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> </blockquote>

The ADL responded in their 2004 letter, stating that:<blockquote>American Jews are Americans. Jews and other religious minorities are part of America's great tradition of religious freedom. The discomfort with proselytizing, or the intrusion of Christian teachings in public schools, is a very legitimate concern.</blockquote>
