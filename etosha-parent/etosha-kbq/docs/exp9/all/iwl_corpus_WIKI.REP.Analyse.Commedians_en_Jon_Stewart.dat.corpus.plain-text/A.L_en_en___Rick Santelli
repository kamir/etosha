==="Chicago Tea Party" remarks===
Santelli drew attention for his remarks made on February 19, 2009, about the [[Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan]], which was announced on February 18. While broadcasting from the floor of the [[CME Group|Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], Santelli accused the government of "promoting bad behavior", and raised the possibility of a "Chicago Tea Party". He suggested that individuals who knowingly obtained high-risk mortgages (and faced impending foreclosure as a consequence) were "losers".<ref>{{cite news|last=Etheridge|first=Eric|title=Rick Santelli: Tea Party Time|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/rick-santelli-tea-party-time/|newspaper=New York Times: Opinionator|date=February 20, 2009}}</ref> The [[Boston Tea Party|Tea Party]] remark was credited by some as launching the [[Tea Party movement]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pallasch|first=Abdon M.|title='Best 5 minutes of my life'; His '09 CNBC rant against mortgage bailouts for 'losers' ignited the Tea Party movement|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=September 19, 2010|page=A4}}</ref><ref name=Krugman />

Santelli later clarified his comments and addressed concerns that the event was staged.<ref name="santelliarticle">{{cite web|last=Santelli |first=Rick |url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/29471026 |title=Rick Santelli: I Want to Set the Record Straight |publisher=cnbc.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref><ref name="ap_santelli">{{cite web|last=Bauder |first=David |url=http://bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/2009_03_02_CNBC:_Rick_Santelli_not_tied_to_political_Web_site |title=CNBC: Santelli not tied to political Web site |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref>

{{quote|I think that this tea party phenomenon is steeped in American culture and steeped in the American notion to get involved with what's going on with our government. I haven't organized. I'm going to have to work to pay my taxes, so I'm not going to be able to get away today.

Santelli's comments also garnered praise from [[Libertarianism|libertarians]]. Mark R. Crovelli wrote:

{{quote|In the world of financial "journalism," CNBC's Rick Santelli stands out as a refreshing and intelligent antidote to the hordes of perma-bulls, fed apologists, and chart sorcerers that otherwise pollute the financial airwaves. ... The trouble with Santelli, however, is that his political and economic philosophy is inconsistent and incomplete, and does not offer a viable alternative to that being peddled by his Keynesian opponents.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crovelli|first=Mark R.|title=The Trouble With Rick Santelli|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/2011/03/mark-r-crovelli/the-trouble-with-rick-santelli/|publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]]}}</ref>}}

Santelli has also been criticized by the left; for example, [[George Monbiot]] said "it is the most alarming example of cheap demagoguery you are likely to have seen."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2010/06/14/bogus-misdirected-and-effective/ |title=Bogus, Misdirected and Effective|last1=Monbiot|first1=George |accessdate=2013-12-12|date=2012-06-14}}</ref> [[Paul Krugman]] said:
{{quote|...Somehow, [the Republican Party] has become infected by an almost pathological meanspiritedness, a contempt for what CNBC's Rick Santelli, in the famous rant that launched the Tea Party, called "losers." If you're an American, and you're down on your luck, these people don't want to help; they want to give you an extra kick....<ref name=Krugman>{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Hunger Games, USA|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/opinion/krugman-hunger-games-usa.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 14, 2013}}</ref>}}
