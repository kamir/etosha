'''Bassem Raafat Muhammad Youssef''' ({{lang-ar|باسم رأفت محمد يوسف}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈbæːsem ˈɾɑʔfɑt mæˈħæmmæd ˈjuːsef|IPA}}; born 22 March 1974) is an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] [[satirist]] and [[columnist]] and former [[cardiac surgeon]], who hosted ''[[Al Bernameg|Al-Bernameg]]'' (''The Program''), a satirical news program from 2011 to 2014. The press has compared Youssef with American comedian [[Jon Stewart]], whose satire program ''[[The Daily Show]]'' inspired Youssef to begin his career.<ref>{{cite news|last=El-Wakil|first=Mai|title=Drawing inspiration from the revolution |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egyptians-find-their-voice-after-years-repression|newspaper=Al Masry Al Youm|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Marx|first=Willem|title=Bassem Youssef: Egypt's Jon Stewart|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-29/bassem-youssef-egypts-jon-stewart#p1|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hassan|first=Abdalla|title=Surgeon Using Parody to Dissect the News in Egypt|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/middleeast/28iht-M28C-EGYPT-SHOW.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref> In 2013, he was named one of the "[[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]]" by ''Time'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassem Youssef|url=http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/bassem-youssef/|newspaper=Time|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Bassem Youssef graduated from Cairo University’s Faculty of Medicine, majoring in [[cardiothoracic surgery]], in 1998. He passed the United States Medical License Exam ([[USMLE]]) and has been a member of the Royal College of Surgeons ([[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]]) since February 2007.<ref>http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/patients/the-surgical-team/finding-a-surgeon?searchableText=Bassem+Youssef&membership_type=&name_type=</ref> He also received training in cardiac and lung transplantation in Germany, after which he spent a year and a half in the US working for a company that produces medical equipment related to cardiothoracic surgery.
In January 2011, Youssef assisted the wounded in [[Tahrir Square]] during the Egyptian Revolution.<ref>http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/35/19963/Arts--Culture/Stage--Street/Revolutionary-satire-Bassem-Youssef-speaks-to-Ahra.aspx</ref>

==Media career==
Following the 18-day-protests of the Jan 25th revolution, Youssef teamed up with [[Tarek ElKazzaz]], Amr Ismail, Mohamed Khalifa, and Mostafa Al-Halawany, to create a political satire show commenting on the political events and how the mainstream media presented them. Influenced by Jon Stewart, the host of the Daily Show in the US, Youssef showcased his talent with just a table, a chair, one camera, and a mural of amateur photos from Tahrir Square in Bassem’s laundry room. Starting with only 5 minutes per episode, the B+ show was uploaded for the first time on YouTube in May 2011.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/user/bassemyoussefshow/about</ref> The show gained five million views in only three months.<ref name="cairo360.com">http://www.cairo360.com/article/tvanddvd/1619/cairo-360-presents-the-bassem-youssef-show-b</ref> Nine webisodes later, Egyptian channel [http://ontveg.com/ ONTV] offered Youssef to create a weekly political satire TV show "Al-Bernameg", literally translating to "the show", making him the first internet to TV conversion in the [[Middle East]]. Youssef had to make a choice between Al Bernameg and the Paediatric Cardiology Fellowship at Cleveland Clinic in the United States. The show premiered in [[Ramadan]] 2011, and became the platform for many writers, artists, and politicians to speak freely about the social and political scene. Al-Bernameg’s success inspired a number of amateur initiatives on various social media channels, who credit the B+ show as their inspiration.<ref name="cairo360.com"/>
In June 2012, Jon Stewart invited Youssef to ''The Daily Show'' for an extended interview, “...I do know a little something about the humour business; your show is sharp, you're really good on it, it's smart, it's well executed, I think the world of what you're doing down there,” Stewart said to Youssef. The segment was one of the highest in viewership on the Daily Show’s website.<ref>http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/okmooj/exclusive---bassem-youssef-extended-interview-pt--2</ref>

In November 2012 [http://www.albernameg.com/ , Al-Bernameg] moved from [http://ontveg.com/ ONTV]'s smallest studio to [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Radio-TheaterDown-Town-Cairo/173511029436584 Radio Theatre] in Cairo’s downtown. Following the move, Youssef succeeded in increasing the show’s worth by eight times in one year.<ref>http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/profile-bassem-youssef-professionalizes-satire</ref><ref>[[ONTV (Egypt)]]</ref> The second season, which premiered in November 2012 on [http://www.cbc-eg.com/ CBC] network, was the first real live audience show in the Middle East. The show gained tremendous success through its humorous yet bold criticism of former Egyptian President [[Mohammed Morsi|Mohamed Morsi]], representing the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Soon after the show started airing, complaints were filed against Youssef, accusing him of insulting [[Islam]], Morsi and disrupting public order and peace.

In March 2013, Bassem Youssef started writing a weekly column expressing his views for Al-Shorouk; one of Egypt’s most prominent and independent daily newspapers.<ref>http://www.shorouknews.com/columns/Basem-youssef</ref> One month later, he was recognized among the 100 most influential people in the world by ''TIME'' magazine.<ref>http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/bassem-youssef/</ref> After that, he appeared for the second time on ''The Daily Show ''with Jon Stewart.<ref>http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/hiwtrs/bassem-youssef</ref>

As Al-Bernameg continued with its growing success, Jon Stewart appeared as a guest on the show in June 2013, marking one of the all-time highlights of Al-Bernameg episodes.<ref>http://www.upworthy.com/jon-stewart-of-america-meets-the-jon-stewart-of-egypt-and-hilarity-ensues</ref>

After a four-month break, Youssef appeared on air in October 2013, with a show that stirred a lot of controversy and criticism. In response to the popular criticism and discontent the show has caused, CBC, the show’s broadcaster, distanced itself from the show and its creators, and decided to stop airing it on its channels. Meanwhile, more than 30 complaints against Youssef and the show were filed at the General Prosecutor’s office, accusing him of insulting the Armed Forces, President Adly Mansour and describing the June 30 revolution as a military coup, in addition to disrupting public order and peace. The General prosecutor has transferred some of the complaints for investigation, which remain subject to the prosecutor’s decision and judgment till this moment.<ref>http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2012/12/02/bassem-youssefs-el-bernameg-in-trouble-on-cbc/</ref>

In November 2013, Youssef’s role in the media was recognized by the Committee to Protect Journalists which awarded him with the International Press Freedom Award, among with three other world renowned journalists.<ref>http://www.cpj.org/awards/2013/bassem-youssef-egypt.php</ref><ref>http://www.cpj.org/awards/2013/bassem-youssef-acceptance-speech.php</ref>

Al-Bernameg reappeared on [http://www.mbc.net/ar/mbc-maser.html MBC Masr] satellite channel on February 7, 2014, achieving unprecedented weekly viewership ratings for 11 consecutive weeks. In June 2014, and after a six-week break, Al-Bernameg team held a press conference where Youssef announced the termination of the show due to pressure on both the show and the airing channel.<ref>http://english.alarabiya.net/en/media/television-and-radio/2014/02/08/Egypt-s-Bassem-Youssef-returns-to-the-air-on-MBC.html</ref><ref>http://deadline.com/2014/06/jon-stewart-farewell-to-egyptian-satire-bassem-youssef-show-cancelled-pressure-video-739390/</ref><ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jon-stewart-of-egypt-bassem-youssef/</ref>

===The B+ Show===
Inspired by the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], Youssef created his first satirical show in March 2011. Entitled ''The B+ Show'' after his blood type,<ref>{{cite episode |last=Gladstone |first=Brooke |title=Egypt Finds Its Own 'Jon Stewart' |work=NPR|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=9 January 2014|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=135444956 |quote= By the way, the YouTube title of the "Bassem Youssef Show" is "B+," after Bassem's blood type.

The show was shot in Youssef's laundry room using a table, a chair, one camera, and a mural of amateur photos from Tahrir Square that cost $100. Youssef used social media to showcase his talent and his show gave a voice to the millions of Egyptians who were seething with anger from the traditional media's coverage of the Egyptian Revolution.

===Al Bernameg Season 1===
After the success of ''The B+ Show'', Egyptian channel [[ONTV (Egypt)|ONTV]], owned by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris]], offered Youssef a deal for ''Al Bernameg'' (literally, "The Program"). With a budget of roughly half a million dollars, the series made him the first internet to TV conversion in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite news|last=Montasser|first=Farah|title=Revolutionary Satire|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/09/02/165062.html|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=Al Arabiya|author2=Deena Adel}}</ref> The show, which consisted of 104 episodes, premiered during [[Ramadan]] 1432 (2011) with Egyptian-American engineer [[Muhammad Radwan]] as its first guest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Mohamed Radwan|url=http://www.syrianrevolution2011.com/videos/player/tabid/68/videoid/2857/---------interview-with-mohamed-radwan-the-program-with-basem-yousef-20110731.aspx|date=31 July 2011|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref> In his show, Youssef has parodied such Egyptian celebrities as show host [[Tawfik Okasha]], composer [[Amr Mostafa]], [[Salafi movement|Salafist]] presidential candidate [[Hazem Salah Abu Ismail]], and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and onetime presidential candidate. In June 2012, Jon Stewart invited Youssef to ''The Daily Show'' for an extended interview, “...I do know a little something about the humor business; your show is sharp, you're really good on it, it's smart, it's well executed, I think the world of what you're doing down there." The segment was one of the highest in viewership on Jon Stewart’s site.

===Al Bernameg Season 2===
The show ''Al Bernameg'' was renewed for a second season after a contract with a second channel, CBC ([[Capital Broadcast Center]]), which premiered on November 23, 2012. The second season consisted of 29 episodes and has recorded one of the highest viewership ratings on both TV and internet with 40 million viewers on TV and more than 184 million combined views for his show on YouTube alone. Just three episodes into the show, several lawsuits were filed against Bassem Youssef and his show, mainly for "insult and defamation". On the season's premiere, Youssef made the owner and coworkers of his channel the subject of his show, as an assurance that he is granted full freedom of expression, and that no topic was off limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/08/254037.html|title=Egyptian comedy show takes on 'merchants of religion'|publisher=AlArabiya|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Un7YwQtQ1M|title=Egypt satire show sparks media clash |publisher=Al Arabiya|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref> CBC did not, however, air his second episode, which also featured further criticism of a TV show host who filed a lawsuit against Youssef. The show returned to its regular schedule for the third episode.

The program, which began with a small group working at home with Youssef, moved from ONTV's smallest studio to Radio theater in downtown Cairo, a theatre redesigned in the likeness of [[NBC Radio City Studios|New York's Radio City]], making it the first live audience show in the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The contents of a typical show's broadcast have evolved, which began with a sarcastic take on current political events, and eventually incorporating the hosting of public figures and stars from various fields, as well as various artists' performances.

After a four month break, ''Al Bernameg'' returned to air for its third series on 25 October 2013. The season premiere marked the first broadcast for the show since the [[2013 Egyptian protests]] had deposed Mohamed Morsi from the Egyptian presidency. Youssef criticised both the Morsi administration and the people's idolization of the Egyptian Defense Minister [[Abdul Fatah al-Sisi]]. The following day the CBC network issued a statement distancing the channel from the political stance taken by Youssef. The CBC network issued another statement, and decided to stop broadcasting ''Al Bernameg'' because of violations in the contract signed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/28/egyptian-satirist-bassem-youssef-returns|title=Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef upsets all sides on return to TV |last1=Kingsley|first1=Patrick|agency=The Guardian|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref>

===Al Bernameg Season 3===
After terminating the contract with CBC, the production company behind ''Al Bernameg'' received offers from different TV channels. The third season was scheduled to air during the first quarter of 2014. In February 2014 it was announced that Youssef had signed a deal with the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]] and that they would start broadcasting ''Al Bernameg'' from 7 February on [[MBC MASR]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/egyptian-satirist-signs-contract-network-185153886.html |title=Egyptian satirist signs contract with new network |last1=Hyde |first1=Maggie |date=1 February 2014 |website=[[Yahoo!

===Post-Al Bernameg===
In January 2015, Harvard’s Institute of Politics (IOP), at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, announced that Youssef will be a Resident Fellow for the spring semester.<ref>http://www.iop.harvard.edu/blog/spring-2015-resident-and-visiting-fellows</ref> <ref>http://www.iop.harvard.edu/current-fellows</ref>

In February 2015, it has been announced that Youssef is collaborating with ''The Daily Show'' Producer [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1582846/ Sara Taksler] to launch a crowd-funding campaign for her documentary about his experience, ''Tickling Giants''.<ref>[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/122699/Arts--Culture/Film/Tickling-Giants,-a-documentary-on-satirist-Bassem-.aspx]</ref>

==Legal issues==
On 1 January 2013, the daily ''[[Al-masry Al-youm]]'' reported that an Egyptian prosecutor was investigating Bassem Youssef on charges of maligning [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Mohammed Morsi]], whose office claimed that Youssef's show was "circulating false news likely to disturb public peace and public security and affect the administration."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/01/01/host-of-egyptian-daily-show-investigated-after-being-accused-of-insulting-president-morsi/|title=Host of Egyptian ‘Daily Show’ investigated after being accused of insulting President Morsi|agency=Associated Press|date=1 January 2013|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref>

On 30 March 2013, an arrest warrant was issued for Youssef for allegedly insulting [[Islam]] and Morsi.
