Oliver's status as an [[Alien (law)|alien]] placed certain constraints on what he could do in his adopted country, but also provided him with comedy material as he poked fun at the opacity and occasional absurdity of the process of attaining [[Permanent residence (United States)|US residency]].<!-- This formerly said US citizenship, but contradicted itself below.

When asked about his residency status in early 2009, Oliver said, "It's an ongoing, and slightly unsettling, battle to be honest.
