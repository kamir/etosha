'''Donald David Dixon Ronald O’Connor''' (August 28, 1925 – September 27, 2003) was an American dancer, singer, and actor who came to fame in a series of movies in which he co-starred alternately with [[Gloria Jean]], [[Peggy Ryan]], and [[Francis the Talking Mule]].

He is best known today for his role as [[Gene Kelly]]'s friend and colleague Cosmo Brown in ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952).

==Early years==
Though he considered [[Danville, Illinois]] to be his home town, O’Connor was born in St. Elizabeth Hospital in [[Chicago]]. His parents, Effie Irene (née Crane) and John Edward "Chuck" O'Connor, were [[vaudeville]] entertainers.<ref name="scribner">{{cite encyclopedia| title=O'Connor, Donald David Dixon Ronald| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2875000221/oconnor-donald-david-dixon.html| encyclopedia=Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives| publisher=Encyclopedia.com| year=2007| accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&pg=PA840&dq=Effie+and+John+Edward+%22Chuck%22+O%27Connor&hl=en&redir_esc=y| author=Frank Cullen| coauthors=Florence Hackman and Donald McNeilly| publisher=Routledge| place=New York| date=8 October 2006| isbn=0-415-93853-8}}</ref> His father's family was from [[County Cork]], Ireland.<ref name="current">{{cite book| title=Current Biography Yearbook, Vol. 16| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=_JsYAAAAIAAJ&q=Effie+and+John+Edward+%22Chuck%22+O%27Connor&dq=Effie+and+John+Edward+%22Chuck%22+O%27Connor&hl=en&redir_esc=y| publisher=H.W.

Several weeks later, his father died of a heart attack while dancing on stage in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]].<ref name=severo>{{cite news|title=Donald O'Connor, 78, Who Danced His Way Through Many Hollywood Musicals, Is Dead| author=Richard Severo|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20716FD3A590C7A8EDDA00894DB404482| work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 September 2003| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref> O'Connor at the time was being held in the arms of the theater manager, Mr. Morris Simms.

==Career==
O'Connor began performing in movies in 1937. He appeared opposite [[Bing Crosby]] in ''[[Sing You Sinners (film)|Sing You Sinners]]'' at age 12. [[Paramount Pictures]] used him in both [[B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)|A and B films]], including ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'' and ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]''.<ref name=severo/> In 1940, when he had outgrown child roles, he returned to vaudeville.

In 1941, O’Connor signed with [[Universal Pictures]], where he began by appearing in seven [[B-picture]] musicals in a row, starting with ''[[What's Cookin'?]]'' (1942) and ending with ''[[Mister Big (1943 film)|Mister Big]]'' (1943). [[Peggy Ryan]] and [[Gloria Jean]] were in four each.  Before ''[[Mister Big (1943 film)|Mister Big]]'' (1943) was released, O’Connor’s popularity soared.  Universal added $50,000 in musical numbers to ''[[Mister Big (1943 film)|Mister Big]]'' (1943) and promoted this B movie to an A.  His subsequent films were all A’s.

[[File:Donald.JPG|thumb|The handprints of Donald O'Connor in front of [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park.]]

On his 18th birthday in August, 1943, during [[World War II]] O'Connor was drafted into the [[United States Army]].  Before he reported for induction on Feb. 6, 1944, Universal already had four O’Connor films completed. They rushed production to complete three more by that date.  With a backlog of seven features, deferred openings kept O’Connor‘s screen presence uninterrupted during the two years he was overseas.  Upon his return, a merger in 1946 had reorganized the studio as Universal-International.

In 1949, he played the lead role in ''[[Francis (1950 film)|Francis]]'', the story of a soldier befriended by a talking mule. The film was a huge success. As a consequence, his musical career was constantly interrupted by production of one ''Francis'' film per year until 1955. It was because of the ''Francis'' series that O'Connor missed playing Bing Crosby's partner in ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]''. O'Connor was unavailable because he contracted an illness transmitted by the mule, and was replaced in the film by [[Danny Kaye]].

O'Connor's role as Cosmo the piano player in ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' earned him a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy or Musical. The film featured his memorable rendition of ''[[Make 'Em Laugh]]''. O'Connor said he smoked 4 packs of cigarettes a day during filming.<ref>http://www.eviltwinltd.com/muppetlabs/oconnor/donald.htm</ref>

O'Connor was a regular host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]''.<ref name=severo/> He hosted a color television special on NBC in 1957, one of the earliest color programs to be preserved on a color [[kinescope]]; an excerpt of the telecast was included in NBC's 50th anniversary special in 1976. In 1954, he starred in his own television series, ''[[The Donald O'Connor Show]]'' on [[NBC]]. In 1968, O'Connor hosted a [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]] also called ''The Donald O'Connor Show''.<ref>Alex McNeil, ''Total Television'', p. 231</ref> He suffered a [[heart attack]] in 1971.<ref>http://www.things-and-other-stuff.com/movies/profiles/donald-oconnor.html</ref>

O'Connor overcame [[alcoholism]] after being hospitalized for three months after collapsing in 1978.<ref name=severo/> His career had a boost when he hosted the [[Academy Awards]], which earned him two [[Primetime Emmy]] nominations. He appeared as a gaslight-era entertainer in the 1981 film ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'', notable for similar encore performances by [[James Cagney]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. It was his first feature film role in 16 years.

O'Connor appeared in the short-lived ''[[Bring Back Birdie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1981, and continued to make film and television appearances into the 1990s, including the [[Robin Williams]] film ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'' as the president of a toy-making company. He had guest roles in 1996 in a pair of popular TV comedy series, ''[[The Nanny]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]''.

In 1998, he received a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]].<ref name="stars">{{cite web| title=Palm Spring Walk of Stars| url=http://www.palmsprings.com/stars/| publisher=PalmSprings.com| accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>

O'Connor's last feature film was the [[Jack Lemmon]]-[[Walter Matthau]] comedy ''[[Out to Sea]]'', in which he played a dance host on a cruise ship. O’Connor was still making public appearances well into 2003.

The most distinctive characteristic of O'Connor's dancing style was its athleticism, for which he had few rivals.  Yet it was his boyish charm that audiences found most engaging, and which remained an appealing aspect of his personality throughout his career.  In his early Universal films, O'Connor closely mimicked the smart alec, fast talking personality of [[Mickey Rooney]] of rival MGM Studio.  For ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', however, MGM cultivated a much more sympathetic sidekick persona, and that remained O'Connor's signature image. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Personal life==
O'Connor was married twice and had four children. His first marriage was in 1944 to Gwendolyn Carter, with whom he had a daughter, Donna. The couple divorced in 1954. He married for a second time, to Gloria Noble, in 1956. Together they had three children; Alicia, Donald Frederick and Kevin. O'Connor and Noble remained married until his death in 2003.<ref name=severo/>

==Death==
O'Connor had undergone quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1990,<ref>http://articles.philly.com/2003-09-28/news/25457720_1_donald-o-connor-vaudeville-alicia-o-connor</ref> and he nearly died from double [[pneumonia]] in January 1998. He died from complications of [[heart failure]] on September 27, 2003 at age 78 at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/28/local/me-oconnor28|title=Donald O'Connor, 78; Entertainer Immortalized by 'Singin' in the Rain'|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2003-09-28|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> His remains were cremated and buried at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn–Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]].

O'Connor was survived by his wife, Gloria, and four children.<ref name=severo/> Gloria O'Connor died from natural causes on June 4, 2013, aged 84.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gloria-o-connor-widow-donald-wilkerson-564182 Gloria O'Connor, Widow of Actor Donald O'Connor, Dies at 84], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', June 6, 2013.</ref>
