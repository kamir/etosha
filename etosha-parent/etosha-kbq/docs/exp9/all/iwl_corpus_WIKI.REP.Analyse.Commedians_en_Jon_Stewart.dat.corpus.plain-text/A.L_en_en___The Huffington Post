==History==
''The Huffington Post'' was founded by [[Arianna Huffington]] in May 2005<ref>{{cite web|title=The Newspaper Publishing Industry|url=http://is.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pages/ISG/documents/FINALNewsreportwithcovers.pdf|work=EU Commission|accessdate=October 6, 2013|author=Andra Leurdijk|author2=Mijke Slot |author3=Ottilie Nieuwenhuis |format=Technical Report|year=2012}}</ref> and launched on May 9. It has an active community, with over one million comments made on the site each month.

Prior to ''The Huffington Post'', Huffington hosted a website called Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was a website called Resignation.com which called for the resignation of President [[Bill Clinton]] and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/talk/zforum/huffington121698.htm |title=Direct Access: Arianna Huffington |work=The Washington Post|date=December 16, 1998|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ariannaonline.huffingtonpost.com/columns/column.php?id=476|title=ARIANNA ONLINE – September 14, 1998 |publisher=Arianna online|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://ariannaonline.huffingtonpost.com/columns/printer_friendly.php?id=504|title=ARIANNA ONLINE – December 24, 1998 – What The Dickens Should Clinton Do?|publisher=Arianna online|date=December 24, 1998|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref>

===Vertical organization===
In 2011, after its purchase by AOL, ''The Huffington Post'' subsumed many of AOL's ''Voices'' properties (including ''AOL Black Voices'', which had originally independently established in 1995 as [[Blackvoices.com]], and ''AOL Latino''). The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of ''Gay Voices'', a vertical dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles. Other established sections, such as ''Impact'' (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and [[Causecast]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-neumann/causecast-ryan-scott_b_1382897.html |title=Amy Neumann: Social Good Stars: Causecast CEO Ryan Scott on the Future of Cause Marketing |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McGann |first=Laura |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/03/huffington-post-outsources-section-to-online-fundraising-organization/ |title=Huffington Post outsources section to online fundraising organization » Nieman Journalism Lab |publisher=Niemanlab.org |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref> ''Women'', ''Teen'', ''College'', ''Religion'' and the Spanish-language ''Voces (en español)'' are also sorted under the Voices meta-vertical.

By late 2013, however, ''The Huffington Post'' was taking steps to operate as more of a "stand-alone business" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and focusing efforts on "premium advertising".<ref>Lucia Moses, [http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/huffpost-takes-more-control-destiny-new-ad-staff-separate-aol-154443 "HuffPost Takes More Control of Destiny With New Ad Staff Separate From AOL"], ''[[Adweek]]'', December 12, 2013.</ref>

==Contributors==
In addition to columns by Arianna Huffington and a group of contributors such as [[John Conyers]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Jeff Pollack (music and media consultant)|Jeff Pollack]], and Roy Sekoff, ''The Huffington Post'' has many bloggers—from politicians and celebrities to academics and policy experts—who contribute on a wide range of topics. Specialist contributors include spiritual author [[Craig Taro Gold]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-taro-gold/ |title=Craig Taro Gold Huffington Post Profile |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=October 19, 2013}}</ref> and health expert Jeff Halevy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-halevy/ |title=Jeff Halevy/ Blogger Index |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref>

Celebrities are allowed to post blogs on the site, and a number have opted to do so over the years. In many cases, such as that of [[Robert Reich]], former Secretary of Labor, content is cross-posted among multiple sites.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/index/ |title=Top Posts / Blogger Index |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref>

The site also publishes columns by specialists in a wide range of fields such as [[Cenk Uygur]], [[Anand Reddi]] on global health issues, [[Alice Waters]] on food, [[Taryn Hillin]] Associate Editor of Weddings and Post Divorce, Harold Katz on dental health, Suzie Heumann on sex, [[Diane Ravitch]] on education, [[Frances Beinecke]] and [[Phil Radford]] on climate change and the environment, [[Jacob M. Appel]] on ethics, [[Howard Friedman|Howard Steven Friedman]] on statistics and politics, [[Auren Hoffman]] on business and politics, Jon LaPook on medicine, [[Cara Santa Maria]] on science, [[Nancy Rappaport]] on child psychiatry, and [[Iris Krasnow]] on marriage. Colon cancer survivor and awareness advocate [[Eric Ehrmann]], one of the original contributors to [[Rolling Stone]] in 1968, has been part of HuffPo's signature group of bloggers since 2009, posting independent political commentary on The Huffington Post, The Huffington Post UK, Le Huffington Post, El Huffington Post, and "Al Huffington Post Maghreb". It publishes [[scoop (term)|scoops]] of current news stories and links to selected prominent news stories.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi | work=Huffington Post | first=Anand | last=Reddi | title=Anand Reddi}}</ref>  Author and former Hollywood story analyst Julie Gray writes for the post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|accessdate=1 August 2014|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

In August 2006, ''The Huffington Post'' announced that [[Softbank Capital|SoftBank Capital]] would invest $5 million in the site, which had grown in popularity in only a year, to help expand it.<ref name="softbank">{{cite web|url=http://www.softbank.com/pages/HP_Oak%20_120108.pdf|title=The Huffington Post Announces $25 Million In Funding|accessdate=March 7, 2009|format=PDF}}</ref> Plans included hiring more staff to update the site 24 hours a day, hiring in-house reporters and a multimedia team to make video reports.

The site has now invested in [[video blogging]], with many of the site contributors contributing via video, capturing clips in the media and posting them on the site.

In November 2008, ''The Huffington Post'' completed $15 million fundraising from investors to finance expansion, including more journalism and the provision of local news across the United States.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Halpin Moscow Updated 48 minutes ago |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/movers_and_shakers/article5201252.ece |title=The Times &#124; UK News, World News and Opinion |work=The Times  |date=January 2, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

On February 7, 2011, [[AOL]] announced it would acquire ''The Huffington Post'' for US$315 million. As part of the deal, Arianna Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group, including ''The Huffington Post'' and existing AOL properties [[Engadget]], [[TechCrunch]], [[Moviefone]], [[MapQuest]], Black Voices, PopEater (now{{when|date=April 2014}} HuffPost Celebrity), [[AOL Music]], AOL Latino (now ''HuffPost Voices''), AutoBlog, Patch and StyleList.<ref name="AOL Press Release"/>

==Controversies and criticism==

===Alternative medicine and anti-vaccination===
''The Huffington Post'' has been criticized by several science bloggers, as well as online news sources, for including articles by supporters of [[alternative medicine]] and [[vaccine controversy|anti-vaccine]] activists and for allegedly censoring rebuttals written by science bloggers before publishing them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parikh |first=Rahul K. |url=http://www.salon.com/env/vital_signs/2009/07/30/huffington_post/ |title=The Huffington Post is crazy about your health |publisher=Salon |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=[[PZ Myers]] |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/12/14/what-do-fox-news-and-the-huffi/ | title=What do Fox News and the Huffington Post have in common? |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=February 21, 2010}}</ref>

[[Steven Novella]], president of the [[New England Skeptical Society]], criticized ''The Huffington Post'' for allowing [[homeopathy]] proponent [[Dana Ullman]] to have a blog there:

<blockquote>Dana Ullman, a notorious homeopathy apologist, actually has a regular blog over at HuffPo. For those of us who follow such things, the start of his blog there marked the point of no return for the ''Huffington Post'' – clearly the editors had decided to go the path of Saruman and "abandon reason for madness." They gave up any pretense of caring about scientific integrity and became a rag of pseudoscience.<ref name=NESS>{{cite web|url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2775|title=Homeopathy Pseudoscience at the Huffpo|last=[[Steven Novella]] |date=January 31, 2011|publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>
