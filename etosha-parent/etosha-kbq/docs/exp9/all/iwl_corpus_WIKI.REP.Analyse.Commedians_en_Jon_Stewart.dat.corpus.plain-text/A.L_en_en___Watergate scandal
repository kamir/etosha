{{Watergate}}
The '''Watergate scandal''' was a major [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|political scandal]] that occurred in the [[United States]] in the 1970s as a result of the June 17, 1972, break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate hotel|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]]'s attempted cover-up of its involvement. When the conspiracy was discovered and investigated by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], the Nixon administration's resistance to its probes led to a [[constitutional crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A burglary turns into a constitutional crisis|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/11/watergate/index.html?_s=PM:US|accessdate=May 13, 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=June 16, 2004}}</ref> The term ''Watergate'' has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included such "[[dirty tricks]]" as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious. Nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures, using the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). The scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by the Nixon administration, [[impeachment in the United States|articles of impeachment]],<ref>http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/371d1/nixonarticles.html</ref> and the resignation of [[Richard Nixon]], the [[President of the United States]]. The scandal also resulted in the [[Indictment#United States|indictment]] of 69 people, with trials or [[plea]]s resulting in 48 being found guilty and incarcerated, many of whom were Nixon's top administration officials.<ref name=convictions/>

The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972. The FBI connected cash found on the burglars to a [[slush fund]] used by the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP), the official organization of Nixon's campaign.<ref name="congressional quarterly vol 1">

== Wiretapping of the Democratic Party's headquarters ==
In January 1972, [[G. Gordon Liddy]], general counsel to the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP), presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP's Acting Chairman [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], and Presidential Counsel [[John Dean]], that involved extensive illegal activities against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. According to Dean, this marked "the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency".<ref>Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense'', p. xvii, Penguin Group, 2014 ISBN 978-0-670-02536-7</ref>

Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic, but two months later is alleged to have approved a reduced version of the plan which involved burgling the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], ostensibly to photograph documents and install listening devices. Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation, but has since insisted that he was duped by Dean and at least two of his subordinates. These included former CIA officers [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[James W. McCord, Jr.|James McCord]], then-CRP Security Coordinator (John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become chairman of the CRP).<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

Two phones inside the offices of the DNC headquarters were [[wiretapped]]. One of those phones was the phone of [[Robert Spencer Oliver]] who at the time was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen and the other was the phone of DNC secretary [[Larry O'Brien]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consortiumnews.com/2012/05/22/the-enduring-secrets-of-watergate/ |title=The Enduring Secrets of Watergate |publisher=Consortiumnews |date= |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

After two attempts to break into the Watergate Complex failed to yield information of value, the order for yet another break-in was given to Liddy by Jeb Magruder, either acting on his own or on orders from Dean.

Shortly after midnight on June 17, 1972, [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], a security guard at the Watergate Complex, noticed tape covering the latches on some of the doors in the complex leading from the underground parking garage to several offices (allowing the doors to close but remain unlocked). He removed the tape, and thought nothing of it. He returned an hour later, and having discovered that someone had retaped the locks, Wills called the police. Five men were discovered and arrested inside the DNC office.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/> They were Virgilio González, [[Bernard Barker]], James McCord, [[Eugenio Martínez]], and [[Frank Sturgis]], who were charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. On September 15, a [[grand jury]] indicted them, as well as Hunt and Liddy,<ref name="congressional quarterly vol 1.">

== Coverup and its unraveling ==

=== Initial coverup ===
Within hours of the burglars' arrest, the FBI discovered the name of E. Howard Hunt in the address books of Barker and Martínez. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in another secret activity, known as the [[White House Plumbers]], which was set up to stop security "[[News leak|leaks]]" and to investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean would later testify he was ordered by top Nixon aide [[John Ehrlichman]] to "[[wikt:deep six|deep six]]" the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied that and, in the end, the evidence from Hunt's safe was destroyed (in separate operations) by Dean and the FBI's Acting Director, [[L. Patrick Gray]].

Nixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a June 23 taped conversation between the President and his Chief of Staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]], in which Nixon asked, "Who was the '''*******''' who ordered it?"  Nonetheless, Nixon subsequently ordered Haldeman to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the burglary.

A few days later, Nixon's Press Secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], described the event as "a third-rate burglary attempt". On August 29, at a news conference, President Nixon stated Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the matter, when in fact Dean had not conducted any investigation at all. Nixon also said, "I can say categorically that... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident". On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, "The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there."<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

=== Money trail ===
On June 19, 1972, it was publicly revealed that one of the Watergate burglars was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] security aide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://watergate.info/chronology/brief-timeline-of-events |title=Brief Timeline of Events |publisher=Malcolm Farnsworth |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> Former Attorney General John Mitchell, who at the time was the head of the Nixon re-election campaign (CRP), denied any involvement with the Watergate break-in or knowledge of the five burglars. On August 1, a $25,000 [[cashier's check]] earmarked for the Nixon re-election campaign was found in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars. Further investigation by the FBI would reveal still more thousands had supported their travel and expenses in the months leading up to their arrests. Examination showed links to the finance committee of CRP.

Several donations (totaling $86,000) were made by individuals who thought they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the President's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the [[Federal Reserve System#Check clearing system|Federal Reserve Check Clearing System]]).

The banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customer's accounts.

The investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, [[Hugh Sloan]].

The Committee, as a private organization, followed normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individual(s) to accept and endorse on behalf of the Committee.  Therefore, no financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the Committee unless it had been endorsed and by a duly authorized individual. On the checks deposited into Barker's bank account was the endorsement of Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee.  But once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited into the accounts which were named on the check and only the accounts so named. Sloan failed to do that.  When he was confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed he had been directed by Committee deputy director [[Jeb Magruder]] and finance director [[Maurice Stans]] to give the money to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].

Liddy gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin.  Barker had attempted to disguise the funds by depositing them into bank accounts which were located in banks outside of the United States. What Barker, Liddy, and Sloan did not know was that the complete record of all such transactions were held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders in April and May 1972 guaranteed the banks would keep the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.

All five of the Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 [[Committee to Re-elect the President|CRP]], thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.<ref>
"There were still simply too many unanswered questions in the case. By that time, thinking about the break-in and reading about it, I'd have had to be some kind of moron to believe that no other people were involved. No political campaign committee would turn over so much money to a man like Gordon Liddy without someone higher up in the organization approving the transaction. How could I not see that? These questions about the case were on my mind during a pretrial session in my courtroom December 4."

On September 29, 1972, it was revealed that John Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, the FBI reported the Watergate break-in was only part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized, and on November 7, the [[United States presidential election, 1972|President was re-elected]] in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.

=== Role of the media ===
The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political repercussions. Relying heavily upon [[anonymous sources]], ''Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and the White House.

Chief among the ''Post's'' anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was confirmed to be [[William Mark Felt, Sr.]], who was then the deputy director of the FBI. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than first disclosed. In one of their last meetings, all of which took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]], Virginia, at 2&nbsp;a.m., Felt cautioned Woodward that he might be followed and not to trust their phone conversations to be secure. Prior to his resignation from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also planted [[News leak|leaks]] about Watergate to [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'' and other publications.<ref name=Holland>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/14/v-fullstory/2639954/the-profound-lies-of-deep-throat.html The profound lies of Deep Throat The Miami Herald February 14, 2012]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref>'''

During this early period, most of the media failed to grasp the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943934-1,00.html |title=Covering Watergate: Success and Backlash |work=Time  |date=July 8, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> After the revelation that one of the convicted burglars wrote to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level coverup, the media shifted its focus. ''Time'' magazine described Nixon as undergoing "daily hell and very little trust". The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the [[Vietnam War]]. Public distrust of the media reached over 40%.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage />

Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to "get" what they perceived as hostile media organizations.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /> The discussions had precedent. At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of ''[[Newsday]]'', after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of [[Charles Rebozo]], a friend of Nixon's.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911434-3,00.html |title=The Nation: More Evidence: Huge Case for Judgment|work=Time |date=July 29, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

The administration and its supporters accused the media of making "wild accusations", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /> Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter [[Baruch Korff]] that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, "Watergate would have been a blip".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942981-11,00.html |title=The Nixon Years: Down from the Mountaintop |work=Time |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate and the competitive nature of the media guaranteed massive coverage of the political scandal.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /> Applications to [[journalism schools]] reached an all-time high in 1974.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage />

=== Scandal blows wide open ===
Nixon's conversations in late March 1973 and all of April reveal that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean, but he had to do so in a way that he was least likely to incriminate himself and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended in August 9, 1974.<ref>Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense'', p.344, Penguin Group, 2014 ISBN 978-0-670-02536-7</ref> On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar [[James McCord]] alleging perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years. On March 28, on Nixon's orders, aide John Ehrlichman told attorney general [[Richard Kleindienst]] that nobody in the White House had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars' trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

John Dean's belief was that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the presidency and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting with Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president's depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up calamity. It was during this meeting that John Dean got the feeling he was being recorded. He wondered this due to the way Nixon was speaking and trying to prod recollections of earlier troublesome conversations about fundraising. Dean's mention of this curiosity while before the Senate Committee on Watergate, would expose the thread that would unravel the fabric of Watergate.<ref>Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', p. 415,416, Penguin Group, 2014 ISBN 978-0-670-02536-7</ref>

Two days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the U.S. attorneys. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean and other White House officials were implicated in the coverup.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review. |publisher=Upi.com |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>"When Judge Sirica finished reading the letter, the courtroom exploded with excitement and reporters ran to the rear entrance to phone their newspapers. The bailiff kept banging for silence. It was a stunning development, exactly what I had been waiting for. Perjury at the trial. The involvement of others. It looked as if Watergate was about to break wide open."

On April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of [[H. R. Haldeman]] and [[John Ehrlichman]], two of his most influential aides, both of whom were indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired [[White House Counsel]] John Dean, who went on to testify before the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] and clearly stated that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to eventually resign rather than be impeached.<ref>Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', p. 610-620, Penguin Group, 2014 ISBN 978-0-670-02536-7</ref>

Writing from prison for ''New West'' and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918947-2,00.html "Sequels: Nixon: Once More, with Feeling"], ''Time'', May 16, 1977</ref>

The President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:

{{quote|In one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. Because Attorney General Kleindienst, though a distinguished public servant, my personal friend for 20 years, with no personal involvement whatsoever in this matter has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case, he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General. The [[Counsel to the President]], John Dean, has also resigned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 in Review |publisher=Upi.com |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>}}

On the same day, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, [[Elliot Richardson]], and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named [[Archibald Cox]] to the position.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

Butterfield said he was reluctant to answer, but finally stated there was a new system in the White House that automatically recorded everything in the [[Oval Office]], the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] and others, as well as Nixon's private office in the [[Old Executive Office Building]].

On Monday, July 16, 1973, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel [[Fred Thompson]] asked Butterfield whether he was "aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President". Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation yet again. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his [[executive privilege]] as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review |publisher=Upi.com |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

=== "Saturday Night Massacre" ===
{{Main|Saturday Night Massacre}}
On October 20, 1973, after Cox refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon demanded the resignations of attorney general Richardson and his deputy [[William Ruckelshaus]] for refusing to fire the special prosecutor. Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]]. Though Bork claims to believe Nixon's order to be valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being "perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-irked-by-emphasis-on-his-role-in-watergate.html|title=Bork Irked by Emphasis on His Role in Watergate|last=Noble|first=Kenneth|date=July 2, 1987|work=New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref> Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.

These actions met considerable public criticism. Responding to the allegations of possible wrongdoing, in front of 400 [[Associated Press]] managing editors on November 17, 1973, Nixon stated emphatically, "I'm not a crook".<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/mediaplay.php?id=4046&admin=37 Richard Nixon: Question-and-Answer Session at the Annual Convention of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association, Orlando, Florida.] The American Presidency Project.</ref><ref>Kilpatrick, Carroll, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/111873-1.htm Nixon Tells Editors, 'I'm Not a Crook'] Washington Post, November 18, 1973.</ref> He needed to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor; Bork chose [[Leon Jaworski]] to continue the investigation.

=== Legal action against Nixon Administration members ===
On March 1, 1974, a [[grand jury]] in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of President Nixon, who became known as the "[[Watergate Seven]]": Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell, [[Charles Colson]], [[Gordon C. Strachan]], [[Robert Mardian]] and [[Kenneth Parkinson]], for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named President Nixon as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]]. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a President can only be indicted after he leaves office.<ref name=TimeLegal>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942980,00.html |title=The Legal Aftermath Citizen Nixon and the Law |work=Time  |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> John Dean, [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], and other figures already had pleaded guilty. On April 5, 1974, [[Dwight Chapin]], the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury. Two days later, the same grand jury indicted [[Ed Reinecke]], the Republican [[lieutenant governor]] of [[California]], on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.

=== Release of the transcripts ===
The Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release [[profanity]] and vulgarity unedited divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary [[Ron Ziegler]] preferred using an edited version where "[[expletive deleted]]" would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be [[redaction|redacted]] from the released tapes.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370091&referer=brief_results [[Theodore White]], ''Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon],'' Readers Digest Press, Athineum Publishers, 1975, pp. 296–298</ref>

Initially, Nixon was given a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon's resignation or impeachment. Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] said, "While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people's minds with a wave of the hand." The Senate Republican Leader [[Hugh Scott]] said the transcripts revealed a "deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral" performance on the part of the President and his former aides. The House Republican Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon's position continued to deteriorate, he "ought to consider resigning as a possible option." The editors of the newspaper ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', a publication that had supported Nixon, wrote, "He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal". The ''[[Providence Journal]]'' wrote, "Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean." This newspaper continued, that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to ''Time'' magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the [[Western United States]] felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601740520,00.html |title=Time Magazine – U.S. Edition – May 20, 1974 Vol. 103 No. 20 |work=Time |date=May 20, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601740513,00.html |title=Time Magazine – U.S. Edition – May 13, 1974 Vol. 103 No. 19 |work=Time |date=May 13, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

=== Supreme Court ===
The issue of access to the tapes went to the Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the Court, which did not include the recused Justice [[William Rehnquist]] (who had recently been appointed by Nixon and had served as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Nixon Justice Department), ruled unanimously that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. They ordered the president to release them to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, President Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes for the public.

=== Release of the tapes ===
The tapes revealed several crucial conversations<ref>Kutler, S: ''Abuse of Power'', page 247. Simon & Schuster, 1997.</ref> that took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent coverup, describing it as a "cancer on the presidency". The burglary team was being paid [[hush money]] for their silence and Dean stated: "That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice."<ref name="nixonlibrary.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/886-008.pdf |title=TRANSCRIPT PREPARED BY THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY STAFF FOR THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF A RECORDING OF A MEETING AMONG THE PRESIDENT, JOHN DEAN AND H.R. HALDEMAN ON MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55&nbsp;am |format=PDF |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> Dean continued and stated that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the White House, demanding money immediately; President Nixon replied that the blackmail money should be paid: "…just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have – handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon? […] you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options."<ref name="nixonlibrary.gov"/>

At the time of the initial congressional impeachment, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes this. Nixon states: "Well…they have to be paid. That's all there is to that. They have to be paid."<ref>Kutler, S: ''Abuse of Power'', page 111. Simon & Schuster, 1997. Transcribed conversation between President Nixon and Haldeman.</ref> During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. President Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.<ref>Bernstein, C. and Woodward, B: ''The Final Days'', page 252. Simon & Schuster, 1976.</ref>

On December 7, 1973, it was found that an [[18½ minute gap|18½ minute portion]] of one recorded tape had been erased. Nixon's longtime personal secretary, [[Rose Mary Woods]], said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone and keep her foot on the pedal. Later [[forensic]] analysis determined that the tape had been erased in several segments – at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.<ref>{{cite news | last =Clymer | first =Adam | title =National Archives Has Given Up on Filling the Nixon Tape Gap |work=The New York Times | date =May 9, 2003 | url =http://www.webcitation.org/5sPqUFNJO | accessdate =January 17, 2007 }}</ref>

Nixon's position was becoming increasingly precarious. On February 6, 1974, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved {{USBill|93|H. Res.|803}} giving the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate impeachment of the President.<ref name="USCongRec|1974|H2349">{{USCongRec|1974|H2349}}-50</ref><ref name="USCongRec|1974|H2362">{{USCongRec|1974|H2362}}-63</ref> On July 27, 1974, the [[House Judiciary Committee]] voted 27–11 to recommend the first article of impeachment against the president: [[obstruction of justice]]. The House then recommended the second article, [[abuse of power]], on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the House recommended the third article: [[contempt of Congress]]. On August 20, 1974, the House authorized the printing of the Committee report H. Rept. 93-1305 which included the text of the resolution impeaching President Nixon and set forth articles of impeachment against him.<ref>{{USCongRec|1974|H29219}}</ref><ref>{{citation | title= Impeachment: An Overview of Constitutional Provisions, Procedure, and Practice | first= Elizabeth B | last= Bazan | date= December 9, 2010 | work= [[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}</ref>

=== "Smoking Gun" tape ===
On August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the coverup: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman meeting in the Oval Office and formulating a plan to block investigations by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that national security was involved. Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:

<blockquote>…the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the–in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because Gray doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have… their investigation is now leading into some productive areas […] and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.</blockquote>

After explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the coverup plan: "the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this …this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.{{'"}} President Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: "All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest." Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: "You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/741-002.pdf |title="TRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND H.R.

Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4320&st=&st1= Statement Announcing Availability of Additional Transcripts of Presidential Tape Recordings] August 5, 1974</ref>

Before the release of this tape, President Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]]. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, [[Fred Buzhardt]] and James St. Clair, that "The tape proved that the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers{{spaced ndash}}for more than two years".<ref>Bernstein, C. and Woodward, B: ''The Final Days'', page 309. Simon & Schuster, 1976.</ref> The tape, which was referred to as a "[[Watergate tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|smoking gun]]" by [[Barber Conable]], proved that Nixon had been involved in the coverup from the beginning.

In the week before Nixon's resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman unsuccessfully tried to get Nixon to grant them the pardons which Nixon had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908732-8,00.html |title=The Administration: The Fallout from Ford's Rush to Pardon|work=Time  |date=September 23, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

=== Resignation ===

The release of the "smoking gun" tape destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would all support impeachment when the vote was taken in the full House.

On the night of August 7, 1974, Senators [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Hugh Scott]] and Congressman [[John Jacob Rhodes]] met with Nixon in the Oval Office and told him that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were not only enough votes in the Senate to convict him, but that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal. Realizing that he had no chance of staying in office, Nixon decided to resign. In a [[SP 3-125: Presidential Address Announcing His Intention to Resign the Oval Office|nationally televised address]] from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:

{{quote|In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future….<br />
I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.

I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/links/nixon_speech.html|title=President Nixon's Resignation Speech|accessdate=August 29, 2009|publisher=PBS}}</ref>}}

Nixon proclaimed his innocence until his death in 1994.

{{wikisource|Proclamation 4311|The Nixon Pardon}}
In his autobiography ''A Time to Heal'', Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon's Chief of Staff, [[Alexander Haig]]. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.

{{quote|Haig emphasized that these weren't ''his'' suggestions. He didn't identify the staff members and he made it very clear that he wasn't recommending any one option over another. What he wanted to know was whether or not my overall assessment of the situation agreed with his.[emphasis in original]... Next he asked if I had any suggestions as to courses of actions for the President. I didn't think it would be proper for me to make any recommendations at all, and I told him so.|[[Gerald Ford]], ''A Time to Heal''<ref>Ford (1979), 4.</ref>}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Final legal actions and effect on the law profession ===
[[Charles Colson]] pleaded guilty to charges concerning the [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|Daniel Ellsberg]] case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974.  On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped. Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977.  Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.<ref>Anita L.

To defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state [[bar associations]] or courts), the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing [[American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility|Model Code of Professional Responsibility]] (promulgated 1969) was a failure.  In 1983 it replaced it with the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].<ref>Theodore Schneyer, "Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code," in ''Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession'', eds. Robert L. Nelson, David M. Trubek, & Rayman L. Solomon, 95–143 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), 104.</ref> The MRPC have been adopted in part or in whole by 49 states (and is being considered by the last one, California). Its preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved [[law school]]s take a course in [[professional responsibility]] (which means they must study the MRPC). The requirement remains in effect.

On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a [[grand jury]]. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the 18½-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire [[Howard Hughes]]. Aided by the [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]], the historian [[Stanley Kutler]], who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the [[Nixon White House tapes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/20004|title=Historian’s work gives a glimpse of Nixon "unplugged" |date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2014|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison}}</ref> sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.<ref name=Secret/> President Obama's justice department opposed the release of the transcripts on privacy grounds.

The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government's decision on whether to appeal.<ref name=Secret>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/29/us-nixon-watergate-idUSTRE76S4ZH20110729 "Nixon's secret Watergate testimony ordered released"], ''Reuters'', July 29, 2011</ref> They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the names of people still alive were redacted.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nixon's long-secret grand jury testimony released |author=Kim Geiger |date=November 10, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-nixon-testimony-20111110,0,6436502.story |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref>

=== Political and cultural reverberations ===
According to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at [[University of Texas at Austin]], Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] predicted during Nixon's final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a "minor footnote".<ref>Thomas J. Johnson, ''Watergate and the Resignation of Richard Nixon: Impact of a Constitutional Crisis'', "The Rehabilitation of Richard Nixon", eds. P. Jeffrey and Thomas Maxwell-Long: Washington, D.C., CQ Press, 2004, pp. 148–149.</ref>

When Congress investigated the scope of the president's legal powers, it belatedly found that the United States had been declared by presidential administrations to be in a continuous open-ended state of emergency since 1950. Congress enacted the [[National Emergencies Act]] in 1976 to regulate such declarations.

The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the suffix "[[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate]]".

[[File:1976 campaign button f.JPG|thumb|right|One of a variety of anti-Ford buttons generated during the 1976 presidential election: it reads "Gerald…Pardon me!" and depicts a thief cracking a safe labeled "Watergate".]]
The ramifications for the November 1974 [[United States Senate elections, 1974|Senate]] and [[United States House election, 1974|House elections]], which took place three months after Nixon's resignation, were significant, with the Democrats gaining five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed "[[Watergate Babies]]"). Watergate led Congress to pass legislation that changed [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign financing]], to amend the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the [[Ethics in Government Act]]). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected albeit not legally required. Presidents since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.

Ford's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]] against [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name="shanescott" />

In 1977, Nixon arranged [[The Nixon Interviews|an interview]] with British journalist [[David Frost]] in the hopes of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968,<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,947901-2,00.html|title = The Nation: David Can Be a Goliath|last = |first = |date = May 9, 1977|work = Time|access-date = }}</ref> he had assumed Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, even getting an apology from Nixon, but his legacy remained tarnished.<ref name="NYTimes David Frost">{{cite news|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|title=David Frost, Interviewer Who Got Nixon to Apologize for Watergate, Dies at 74|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/world/europe/david-frost-known-for-nixon-interview-dead-at-74.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=November 25, 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=September 1, 2013}}</ref>

In 2010, Congressman [[Ron Paul]] questioned whether the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] had been used to funnel illegal money during Watergate and other scandals. This led [[House Financial Services Committee]] Chairman [[Barney Frank]] to ask the agency to investigate the charges. In April 2012, the Federal Reserve bank inspector general released a report stating "we did not find any evidence of undue political interference with or improper actions by Federal Reserve officials related to the cash found on the Watergate burglars".<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke |first=Dave |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/03/us-federalreserve-watergate-idUSBRE83215U20120403 |title=Fed not involved in Watergate, watchdog says Reuters April 3, 2012 |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

In the aftermath of Watergate, "[[follow the money]]" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book ''[[All The President's Men]]'' and did not become associated with it until the [[All the President's Men (film)|movie of the same name]] was released in 1976.<ref>Follow The Money: On The Trail Of Watergate Lore, NPR, June 16, 2012</ref>

== Purpose of the break-in ==
Despite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the actual purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established, though records from the ''United States v. Liddy'' trial which were made public in 2013 showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told to take part in the operation with the hopes of finding evidence linking Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns.<ref name=baldwinlist>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/watergate-records_n_3606339.html|title=Watergate Records Released 40 Years After Being Filed Under Seal|author=Jessica Gresko, Associated Press|publisher=Huffington Post|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref> The likeliest hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of [[Larry O'Brien]], the DNC Chairman.<ref>{{Cite news

Spencer Oliver]], Oliver's secretary Ida "Maxine" Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.<ref name=baldwinlist />  Based on these revelations, [[Texas A&M]] history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf|title=In Re: Petition of Luke Nitcher|author= Senior Judge Royce Lamberth|publisher=United States District Court for the District of Columbia|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref> argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats.<ref name=notobrien /> Instead, Nichter sided with late ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[J. Anthony Lukas]]' conclusion that its purpose was to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as Oliver's office had frequently been used to arrange such meetings. However, he acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information about what Baldwin heard was released.<ref name=notobrien />

In 1968, O'Brien was appointed by Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] to serve as the national director of Humphrey's presidential campaign and, separately, by [[Howard Hughes]] to serve as Hughes' public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, [[Donald Nixon]], was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked [[John H. Meier]], an advisor to Howard Hughes, about O'Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan's existence surfaced during the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]] campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment.<ref>Donald L. Bartlett ''Howard Hughes'', p. 410, W. W. Norton & Co., 2004 ISBN 978-0-393-32602-4</ref> From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.<ref>Charles Higham ''Howard Hughes'', p. 244, Macmillan, 2004 ISBN 978-0-312-32997-6</ref>

Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien.<ref>DuBois, Larry, and Laurence Gonzales (September 1976). ''Hughes Nixon and the C.I.A.: The Watergate Conspiracy Woodward and Bernstein Missed''. Playboy.</ref> O'Brien, who had received $25,000 from Hughes, did not actually have any documents but Meier claims to have wanted Richard Nixon to think that he did. It is only a question of conjecture then that Donald told his brother that Meier had given the Democrats all the damaging Hughes information and that O'Brien had the proof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meier.com/ageofsecrets/About.html |title=Age of Secrets |publisher=Meier.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> As a matter of fact O'Brien had also been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.<ref>Fred Emery ''Watergate'', p. 30, Simon & Schuster, 1995 ISBN 978-0-684-81323-3</ref>

Numerous hypotheses have persisted in claiming deeper significance to the Watergate scandal than that acknowledged by media and historians:
*In the book ''The Ends of Power'', Nixon's chief of staff [[H. R. Haldeman]] claimed that the term "[[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]]", mentioned by Nixon in a tape-recorded White House conversation as the reason the CIA should put a stop to the Watergate investigations,<ref name="smoking gun tape">{{cite web | title =The Smoking Gun Tape | format =Transcript of the recording of a meeting between President Nixon and H.

Kennedy]] administration. The CIA had not disclosed this plot to the [[Warren Commission]], the commission investigating the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]], despite the fact that it would attribute a motive to Castro in the assassination.<ref>

</ref> Any such revelation would also expose CIA/Mafia connections that could lead to unwanted scrutiny of suspected CIA/Mafia participants in the assassination of the president. Furthermore, Nixon's awareness as vice-president of the Bay of Pigs plan and his own ties to the underworld and unsavory intelligence operations might come to light. A theoretical connection between the Kennedy assassination and the Watergate tapes was later referred to in the film [[Nixon (film)|''Nixon'']], directed by [[Oliver Stone]].
*''[[Silent Coup]]'' is a bestselling 1992 book by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin in which they contend that former Nixon White House counsel John Dean orchestrated the 1972 Watergate burglary to protect his future wife Maureen Biner by removing information linking her to a call-girl (prostitute) ring that worked for the DNC. The authors also argued that Alexander Haig was not Deep Throat but was a key source for Bob Woodward, who had briefed Haig at the White House in 1969 and 1970 as a Naval officer.<ref>{{cite web

There, without any opposition party back then, members of the Party had been wiretapped for any possible wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news |first=Art |last=Buchwald |date=May 15, 1973 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oQBOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7IsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2474%2C1962237 |title=Watergate baffled Brezhnev |page=4 |work=[[The Free Lance-Star]] |location=[[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] |accessdate=November 23, 2014 }}</ref> In June 1973, when Brezhnev arrives to the United States to have a one-week meeting with President Nixon,<ref>{{cite news |first=Ray |last=Moseley |date=June 16, 1973 |title=Brezhnev to ignore Watergate in talks |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cKJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=r48DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7240%2C4226076 |publisher=[[Daily Record (Washington)|Daily Record]] |page=1 |location=[[Ellensburg, Washington]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |volume=Volume 72 |issue=142 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 }}</ref> Brezhnev told the press, "I do not intent to refer to that matter—[the Watergate]. It would be completely indecent for me to refer to it. [...] My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect." When one reporter suggested that President Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were "weakened" by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, "It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's "realistic and constructive approach to [[Soviet Union–United States relations]] [...] passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XTkoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7434%2C4352706 |title=Brezhnev to Shun Talk of Watergate |publisher=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=June 15, 1973 |at=Part 1, page 3 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}</ref>

{{flagcountry|United Kingdom}}&nbsp;– Talks between Nixon and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]] may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath privately was outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.<ref name="Heath's reaction Maine Newspaper">{{cite news |last=Gavshon |first=Arthur L. |date=July 18, 1973 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yHsgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sWcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1093%2C2199417 |title=Britain's Leader Shows Restraint Over Bugging |publisher=The Lewiston Daily Sun |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}</ref>

{{flagu|United States}}&nbsp;– In May 1975, after the [[fall of Saigon]], which ended the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said if the scandal did not affect Richard Nixon and the Congress did not override Nixon's veto of the [[War Powers Resolution]], [[North Vietnam]] would not have captured [[South Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The name-calling in the wake of defeat |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=soMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=e30FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1077%2C746828 |date=May 6, 1975 |publisher=[[New Straits Times]] |location=[[Malaysia]] |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}</ref>
