''The Journal'' was established in 1985. As of 2010 it had a verified circulation of 60,000 and an estimated readership of 180,000; it is the largest Jewish weekly outside of New York City.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/ls-23260_1_mainstream-media/2 |title=A Simpson Spin All Their Own Media: Papers outside the mainstream don't try to compete with the big boys.

The paper was initially distributed in part by the [[Jewish Federation]] of Greater Los Angeles. The first issue appeared on February 28, 1986.  The editor was Gene Lichtenstein, who served until 2000,<ref>Tom Tugend, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/the_lichtenstein_formula_for_a_jewish_paper_20060630 "The Lichtenstein Formula for a Jewish Paper"], ''The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles'', June 29, 2000.</ref> and the first art director was Katherine Arion, a Romanian-born artist who came to the United States in 1981.<ref>Shelley Adler, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/old_stories/article/excavating_the_past_19980626 "Art Notes: The Artist Behind Our Cover"], ''The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles'', June 25, 1998.</ref>  After becoming independent from the Jewish Federation in 2005, it went through difficulties and its circulation shrunk. Circulation has recovered to 50,000 since then, and the paper has undertaken new initiatives, including expanded internet offerings, a social networking site called everyjew.com, and ''TRIBE'' magazine, launched in December 2009. The paper, like other print media, has continued to face financial pressures (cutting staff positions and salaries during 2009), but it strengthened its financial situation in May 2010, when it received commitments from a group of Jewish philanthropists for additional funding intended to assure its continuing financial viability.<ref name="Rainey">James Rainey, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-onthemedia-20100512,0,3345960,full.column "On the Media: Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles adapts to changing media market: Niche journalism and an $800,000 donation make its future seem secure"].
