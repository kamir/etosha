The '''''New York Post''''' is an American [[daily newspaper]], primarily distributed in New York City and its surrounding area. It is the 13th-oldest and seventh-most-widely circulated newspaper in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.burrellesluce.com/top100/2009_Top_100List.pdf Burrellesluce.com]</ref> Established in 1801 by [[Federalist Party|federalist]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], it became a respected [[broadsheet]] in the 19th century, under the name '''''New York Evening Post'''''. Since 1993, the ''Post'' has been owned by [[News Corporation]] and its successor, [[News Corp]], which had owned it previously from 1976 to 1988. Its editorial offices are located at [[1211 Avenue of the Americas]], in [[New York City]], [[New York]].

The modern version of the paper is written in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]].

==History==
The ''New York Post'', established on November 16, 1801 as the ''New-York Evening Post'', describes itself as the nation's oldest continuously published ''daily'' newspaper. ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'', believed to be the oldest continuously published newspaper, was founded in 1764 as a semi-weekly paper; it did not begin publishing daily until 1836. ''[[The New Hampshire Gazette]]'', which has trademarked its claim of being ''The Nation's Oldest Newspaper'', was founded in 1756, also as a weekly. Moreover, since the 1890s it has been published only for weekends.

===19th century===

The ''Post'' was founded by [[Alexander Hamilton]] with about [[United States dollar|US$]]10,000 from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the ''New-York Evening Post,''<ref>Allan Nevins, ''The Evening Post: Century of Journalism'', Boni and Liveright, 1922, page 17.</ref> a [[broadsheet]]. Hamilton's co-investors included other New York members of the [[Federalist Party]], such as [[Robert Troup]] and [[Oliver Wolcott]],<ref>Nevins, page 14.</ref> who were dismayed by the election of [[Thomas Jefferson]] as U.S. [[U.S. President|President]] and the rise in popularity of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]].<ref name=Emery_opcit>Emery & Emery, page 74.</ref> The meeting at which Hamilton first recruited investors for the new paper took place in then-country weekend [[villa]] that is now [[Gracie Mansion]].<ref>Nevins, pages 17–18.</ref> Hamilton chose [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]] as his first [[editor in chief|editor]].<ref name=Emery_opcit/>

The most famous 19th-century ''New-York Evening Post'' editor was the poet and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[William Cullen Bryant]].<ref>Emery & Emery, page 90.</ref> So well respected was the ''New-York Evening Post'' under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the [[England|English]] [[philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]], in 1864.<ref>Nevins, page 341.</ref>

In the summer of 1829, Bryant invited [[William Leggett (writer)|William Leggett]], the [[Locofoco]] Democrat, to write for the paper. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, Leggett began to write political editorials. Leggett's [[traditional liberalism|classical liberal]] philosophy entailed a fierce opposition to [[central banking]], a support for voluntary labor unions, and a dedication to [[laissez-faire]] economics. He was a member of the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]. Leggett became a co-owner and editor at the ''Post'' in 1831,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 through 1835.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Another co-owner of the paper was [[John Bigelow]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, John Bigelow, Sr. graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the [[Sigma Phi]] Society and the Philomathean Society, and was admitted to the bar in 1838.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the ''New York Evening Post''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] took control of the ''New-York Evening Post'', as well as ''[[The Nation]]'', which became the ''Post''{{'}}s weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of [[Carl Schurz]], [[Horace White (writer)|Horace White]] and [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin L. Godkin]].<ref>Nevins, page 438.</ref> When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief.<ref>Nevins, page 458.</ref> White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E1D71F31E733A05754C1A96F9C946796D6CF Horace White Dies]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 17, 1916.</ref><ref>Nevins, pp. 440–441.</ref>

In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard's son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard]],<ref>''Webster's Biographical Dictionary'', G. & C. Miriam Co., 1964, page 1522.</ref> a founding member of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]<ref>Christopher Robert Reed, ''The Chicago NAACP and the Rise of Black Professional Leadership, 1910–1966'', Indiana University Press, 1997, page 10.</ref> and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].<ref>Emery & Emery, page 257.</ref>

===20th century===
Villard sold the paper in 1918, after widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during [[World War I]] hurt its circulation. In 1948 ''[[The Bronx Home News]]'' merged with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landsofnewyork.com/County-Data-For-Bronx-County-New-York |title=County Data for Bronx County, New York |publisher=LandsofNewYork.com |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

The new owner was [[Thomas W. Lamont|Thomas Lamont]], a senior partner in the [[Wall Street]] firm of [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]]. Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a [[consortium]] of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by [[Edwin Francis Gay]], dean of the [[Harvard Business School]], whose members included [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. [[conservatism|Conservative]] [[Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis|Cyrus H. K. Curtis]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Newspaper/NYNewspapers.html| title=New York Newspapers and Editors |accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref>—publisher of the ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''—purchased the ''New-York Evening Post'' in 1924<ref name=ketupa>{{cite web|url=http://www.ketupa.net/curtis.htm|title=ketupa.net media profiles: curtis|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref> and briefly turned it into a non-sensational [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] in 1933.<ref name=ketupa/>

In 1934, [[J. David Stern]] purchased the paper, changed its name to the ''New York Post'',<ref name=ketupa/> and restored its broadsheet size and liberal perspective.<ref>Emery & Emery, page 292.</ref>

In 1939, [[Dorothy Schiff]] purchased the paper. Her husband, [[George Backer]], was named editor and publisher.<ref>Deborah G. Felder & Diana L. Rosen, ''Fifty Jewish Women Who Changed the World'', Citadel Press, 2003, page 164.</ref> Her second editor (and third husband) [[Ted Thackrey]] became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794542,00.html|title=Dolly's Goodbye| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= January 31, 1949|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref> Together, they recast the newspaper into its current tabloid format.<ref>Emery & Emery, page 556.</ref> In 1949, [[James Wechsler]] became editor of the paper, running both the news and the editorial pages. In 1961, he turned over the news section to [[Paul Sann]] and remained as editorial-page editor until 1980.

Under Schiff's tenure the ''Post'' was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most-popular columnists of the time, such as [[Joseph Cookman]], [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Max Lerner]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Pete Hamill]], and [[Eric Sevareid]], in addition to theatre critic [[Richard Watts, Jr.]] and [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] [[columnist]] [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]].

===Murdoch ownership===
In 1976, [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought the ''Post'' for US$30.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479107|title=News Corp: Historical Overview|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 14, 2005|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061208130444/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479107 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=December 8, 2006}}</ref> The ''Post'' at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing ''[[New York World Journal Tribune|World Journal Tribune]]''. However, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into the ''Post's'' profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. (The paper has lost money ever since).<ref name=Emery_opcit/>  Under Murdoch's watch, the ''Post'' veered sharply to the right editorially, in accordance with Murdoch's views.

In late October 1995, the ''Post'' announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication and start a Sunday edition,<ref>{{Citation |publication-date=October 24, 1995 |title=New York Post to Publish on Sundays |publisher= New York Times |page= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/nyregion/new-york-post-to-publish-on-sundays.html |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> which it last published briefly in 1989.<ref>{{Citation |publication-date=February 5, 1996 |title=Post Plans Sunday Paper |publisher= New York Times |page=6|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/nyregion/post-plans-sunday-paper.html |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> On April 14, 1996, the ''Post'' delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages.<ref name="Orlando">{{Citation |publication-date=April 14, 1996 |title=The New York Post Starts Inexpensive Sunday Paper |publisher= [[Orlando Sentinel]] |page=A26 |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/new-york-post/recent/2|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from competitors ''The Daily News'' and ''The New York Times,'' was part of the ''Post's'' efforts "to find a niche in the nation's most competitive newspaper market".<ref name="Orlando"/>

In December 2012, Murdoch [http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_549.html announced] that Jesse Angelo had been appointed Publisher.

====Style====
[[Image:NYPost.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the paper's most famous headlines, from the April 15, 1983 edition.]]

Murdoch imported the tabloid journalism style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', which was the highest selling daily newspaper in the UK for a long time. This style was typified by the ''Post''{{'}}s famous headlines such as "Headless body in topless bar" (shown on the right). In its 35th-anniversary edition, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' Magazine listed this as one of the greatest headlines. It also has five other ''Post'' headlines in its "Greatest Tabloid Headlines" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8568/|title=Greatest Tabloid Headlines|publisher=Nymag.com|date=March 31, 2003|accessdate=February 11, 2009}}</ref>

Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media [[cross ownership|cross-ownership]] after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (now [[WNYW-TV]]) and four other stations from [[Metromedia]] to launch the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to [[Peter S. Kalikow]], a [[real-estate]] magnate with no news experience.<ref name=MomentTruth>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/1/gangs-hickey.asp|title=Moment of Truth|author=Neil Hickey|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=January–February 2004|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070423111034/http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/1/gangs-hickey.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=April 23, 2007}}</ref> When Kalikow declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1993,<ref name=MomentTruth/> the paper was temporarily managed by [[Steven Hoffenberg]],<ref name=MomentTruth/> a financier who later pleaded guilty to [[security (finance)|securities]] [[fraud]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitization.net/pdf/nomura_abs_030502.pdf|title=ABS Credit Migrations|work=Nomura Fixed Income Research|date= March 5, 2002|page= 20|format=PDF|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref> and, for two weeks, by [[Abraham Hirschfeld|Abe Hirschfeld]],<ref>Bob Fenster, ''Duh!

Post slams its new owner|work=The Telegraph|date=Mar 16, 1993|page=10|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>—The ''Post'' was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch's News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[governor of New York]] [[Mario Cuomo]], persuaded the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier.<ref>Hickey, "Moment of Truth".</ref> Without that FCC ruling, the paper would have shut down. Under Murdoch's renewed direction, the paper continued its conservative editorial viewpoint.

====Criticism====

The ''Post'' has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for [[sensationalism]], blatant advocacy and conservative bias. In 1980, the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' stated that "the ''New York Post'' is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem – a force for evil."<ref name="CJR">''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', volume 18, number 5 (Jan/Feb 1980), pages 22–23.</ref>

Perhaps the most serious allegation against the ''Post'' is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], where Murdoch has invested heavily in [[satellite television]].<ref name=PageSix>{{cite news|author=James Barron and Campbell Robertson|title=Page Six, Staple of Gossip, Reports on Its Own Tale|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=May 19, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/nyregion/19six.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin|accessdate=May 19, 2007}}</ref>

Critics say that the ''Post'' allows its editorial positions to shape its story selection and news coverage. ''Post'' executive editor [[Steven D. Cuozzo]] has responded that the ''Post'' "broke the [[elitism|elitist]] media stranglehold on the national agenda."

According to a survey conducted by [[Pace University]] in 2004, the ''Post'' was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it "not credible" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf|author=Jonathan Trichter|title=Tabloids, Broadsheets, and Broadcast News|work=Pace Poll Survey Research Study|date=June 16, 2004|format=PDF|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref>

The [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] song "[[A Letter to the New York Post|A Letter to the ''New York Post'']]" from their album ''[[Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper.

The ''Post''{{'}}s coverage of the murder of [[Hasidic]] landlord Menachem Stark prompted outrage from Jewish communal leaders and public figures.

====Controversies====
There have been numerous controversies surrounding the ''Post'':
* In 1997, a national news story concerning [[Rebecca Sealfon]]'s victory in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', a direct in-market competitor. The ''Post'' published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the ''Daily News'' as printed on a placard she was wearing.<ref>{{cite news|last=David|first=Shenk|authorlink=David Shenk|title=Every Picture Can Tell a Lie|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 20, 1997|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/10/7815|accessdate=March 22, 2008}}</ref>
* On November 8, 2000, the ''Post'' printed "BUSH WINS!" in a huge headline,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush wins!|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,8543,-10104103692,00.html|work=The Guardian|accessdate=July 5, 2008|location=London}}</ref> although the presidential [[2000 U.S. Presidential election|election]] remained in doubt because of the [[Florida election recount|recount]] needed in [[Florida]]. Like the ''Post,'' many other newspapers around the country published a similar headline after the four major TV networks called the election for [[George W. Bush]].
* On March 10, 2004, the ''Post'' re-ran, as a full-color page one photograph,<ref>David Nolan, [http://web.archive.org/web/20081011141844/http://uweb.txstate.edu/~dn15/ETHICS.HTM "New York Post Blasted for running suicide shot on cover"], Media Ethics, Texas State University-San Marcos, School of Journalism & Mass Communication.

Among criticisms leveled at the ''Post''<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090422005117/http://www.plastic.com/comments.html;sid=04/03/13/06191315;cid=40 "From The 'If It Bleeds It Leads Department'&nbsp;— Death Jump Photo Ran Because That's What We Do"], Plastic(.com).

* On July 6, 2004, the ''Post'' ran an article claiming to have learned exclusively that [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]'s Presidential nominee-in-waiting, had selected former [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Dick Gephardt]] to be the party's [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] nominee.

* On April 21, 2006, several [[Asian-American]] advocacy groups protested the use of the headline "Wok This Way" for a ''Post'' article about Bush's meeting with the [[Hu Jintao]], President of the People's Republic of China.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/04-22-2006/front/story/411080p-347724c.html|author=Paul H.B.

The caption on the front read, "Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die" on top, and "DOOMED" in large, boldface print on the bottom. The image caused outrage among many, as its use was viewed as exploiting a tragedy for commercial gain. Abbasi stated that he was not strong enough to pull the man up, and attempted to use the flash on his camera to alert the driver of the oncoming train.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thespec.com/news/ontario/article/848198--furor-over-ny-post-photo-of-doomed-man|author=Curtis Rush|title=Furor over NY Post photo of doomed man|work=Thespec.com|date=December 4, 2012|accessdate=December 5, 2012}}</ref>
* Aspects of the ''Post''{{'}}s coverage of the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombings]] were criticized. The ''Post'' reported in several stories on the day of the attack that the death toll was 12, while most organizations reported two and then three fatalities. In addition, they reported that a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] national was being held as a suspect, but Boston Police denied this and said they had no suspects in custody.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/ny-post-boston-bombings_n_3092814.html|title=NY Post Criticized Over Coverage Of Boston Bombings|last=Mirkinson|first=Jack|date=April 16, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> Additionally, the April 18 cover of the ''Post'' featured a full-page photo of two young men the paper described as being sought by law enforcement in possible connection with the attack.

The ''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' often take potshots at each other's work and accuracy, particularly in their respective gossip-page items.

In certain editions of the February 14, 2007, newspaper, an article referring to then-Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]'s support base for her [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential run]] referred to then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] as "[[Osama Bin Laden|Osama]]";<ref>{{cite news|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/bill-snares-osama-guy-2/|title=Bill Snares Osama Guy|work=New York Times Blog|date=February 14, 2007|author=The Empire Zone|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref> the paper realized its error and corrected it for the later editions and the website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02142007/news/nationalnews/bill_snares_obama_guy_nationalnews_maggie_haberman.htm|title=Bill snares Obama guy|work=New York Post|author=Maggie Haberman|date=February 14, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref> The ''Post'' noted the error and apologized in the February 15, 2007, edition.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/02152007/news/regionalnews/correction_regionalnews_.htm "CORRECTION"], ''New York Post'', February 15, 2007.

==Operations==

===Website===
In 1996, the ''Post'' launched an [[Internet]] version of the paper [http://www.nypost.com nypost.com]. The original site included color photos and sections broken down into News, Sports, Editorial, Gossip, Entertainment and Business. It also had an archive for the past seven days. Since then, it has been redesigned a number of times, with the latest incarnation launched on September 6, 2009. In 2005 the [[website]] implemented a registration requirement but removed it in July 2006.

The current website also features continually updated breaking news; entertainment, business, and sports blogs; links to ''[[Page Six Magazine]]''; photo and video galleries; original ''Post'' videos; user-submitted photos and comments; and streaming video for live events.

===Highlights{{anchor|Page Six|Page 6}}===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Page Six]], [[Page six]] and [[Page 6 (disambiguation)]] -->
{{Redirect|Page Six|the Atari computer magazine|Page 6}}
The paper is well known for its [[sports]] section, which has been praised for its comprehensiveness; it begins on the back page, and among other coverage, contains columns about sports in the media by [[Phil Mushnick]].

The ''Post'' is also well known for its [[gossip]] columnist [[Cindy Adams]].

{{anchor|Page Six|Page 6}}The best-known gossip section is "'''Page Six'''", created by [[James Brady (columnist)|James Brady]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituaries in the news|work=Associated Press|date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=January 28, 2009|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DEATHS?SITE=AP&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and currently edited by Emily Smith (Although it no longer actually appears on page 6 of the tabloid). February 2006 saw the debut of ''Page Six Magazine'', distributed free inside the paper. In September 2007, it started to be distributed weekly in the Sunday edition of the paper. In January 2009, publication of ''Page Six Magazine'' was cut to four times a year.

===Sales===
The daily circulation of the ''Post'' decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 in the late 1960s{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to approximately 418,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Under Murdoch, the ''Post'' launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' in 1978—prompting the ''Daily News'' to retaliate with a PM edition called ''Daily News Tonight''. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon ''Post'' experienced and the ''Daily News'' ultimately folded ''Tonight'' in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day ''Post'' soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition (It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977 with the news of the arrest the night before of [[David Berkowitz]], the infamous "Son of Sam" serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer). But the ''Post'' lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down the ''Post's'' PM edition in 1982, turning the ''Post'' into a morning-only daily.

The ''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw ''Post'' circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007,<ref name=circ/> achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. In October 2006, the ''Post'' for the first time surpassed the ''Daily News'' in circulation—only to see the ''Daily News'' overtake its rival a few months later.<ref>Associated Press, [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-05-newspaper-circulation_N.htm "Newspaper circulation off 2.6%; some count Web readers"], November 5, 2007. Accessed June 5, 2008.</ref> As of April 2010, the ''Post'''s daily circulation is 525,004, just 10,000 behind the ''Daily News''.<ref>[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004086334 Audit Bureau of Circulation]</ref>

Yet the ''Post'' has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that the ''Post'' loses up to $70 million a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/rupert-murdoch-wall-street-journal-news-corp_n_1635680.html|author=Michael Calderone|title=Rupert Murdoch Suggests Wall Street Journal Won't Face Cuts In News Corp. Split|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=June 28, 2012}}</ref> One commentator has suggested that the ''Post'' cannot become profitable as long as the competing ''Daily News'' survives, and that Murdoch may be trying to force the ''Daily News'' to fold or sell out.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_08/b3921114_mz016.htm|author=Anthony Bianco|title=Profitless Paper in Relentless Pursuit|work=[[Business Week]]|date=February 21, 2005|accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref>

==Recent headquarters==
The 1906 [[Old New York Evening Post Building]] is a designated landmark.

From 1926, the newspaper's main office was at 75 West Street. In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'', which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the Post. In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated the ''Post's'' news and business offices to the [[News Corporation]] headquarters tower at 1211 [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]] (Sixth Avenue) in midtown Manhattan. The ''Post'' shares this building with [[Fox News Channel]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', both of which are also owned by Murdoch. The ''Post'' and the New York City edition of the ''Journal'' are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in the borough of [[The Bronx]].

==Cultural references==
In his 1984 novel ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'', [[Jay McInerney]] chronicled the saga of the fictional "Coma Baby" in the ''Post''.

In the 1984 film ''[[Top Secret]]'', a sadistic torturer is identified as "Klaus, a moron who knows only what he reads in the ''New York Post''."

In 2013, comedian [[John Mulaney]] developed the hierarchy of ''Post'' headlines in his special ''New In Town.''  The hierarchy goes as follows: angels, tots, heroes, bozos, and perverts.
