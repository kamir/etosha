==Career==
While working odd jobs across [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], Chicago, and [[New York City]], Sedaris was discovered in a Chicago club by radio host [[Ira Glass]]; Sedaris was reading a diary he has kept since 1977.

Retrieved October 7, 2007.</ref> Sedaris' success on ''The Wild Room'' led to his [[National Public Radio]] debut on December 23, 1992, when he read a radio essay on ''[[Morning Edition]]'' titled "[[SantaLand Diaries]]", which described his purported experiences as an elf at [[Macy's]] department store during [[Christmas]] in New York.

"SantaLand Diaries" was a success with listeners,<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5066175 "Sedaris and Crumpet the Elf: A Holiday Tradition"], [[National Public Radio|NPR]].org. Retrieved October 8, 2007.</ref> and made Sedaris what ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "a minor phenomenon".<ref name="he does"/> He began recording a monthly segment for NPR based on his diary entries, edited and produced by Glass, and signed a two-book deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]].<ref name="he does"/> In 1993, Sedaris told ''The New York Times'' he was publishing his first book, a collection of stories and essays, and had 70 pages written of his second book, a novel "about a man who keeps a diary and whom Mr. Sedaris described as 'not me, but a lot like me'".<ref name="he does"/>

==Veracity of nonfiction work==
In 2007, in an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Alexander S. Heard]] stated that much of Sedaris' work is insufficiently factual to justify being marketed as nonfiction.<ref name="tnr_ah">Heard, Alex.

Subsequently, in the wake of a controversy involving [[Mike Daisey]]'s dramatizing and embellishing his personal experiences at Chinese factories, during an excerpt from his theatrical monologue for ''[[This American Life]]'', new attention has been paid to the veracity of Sedaris' nonfiction stories. NPR will label stories from Sedaris, such as "[[SantaLand Diaries]]", as fiction, while ''This American Life'' will [[Fact checker|fact check]] stories to the extent that memories and long-ago conversations can be checked.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/david-sedariss-exaggerations-in-memoirs-npr-nonfiction-program-raise-questions/2012/05/13/gIQAm9QONU_story.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Paul|last=Farhi|title=Style|date=May 14, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' already subjects nonfiction stories written for that magazine to its comprehensive fact-checking policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/books/08lyal.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|title=What You Read Is What He Is, Sort Of|date=June 8, 2008}}</ref>

==The Talent Family==
Sedaris is also a playwright, having written with his sister, actress [[Amy Sedaris]], several plays under the name "The Talent Family". These include ''Stump the Host'' (1993), ''Stitches'' (1994), and ''The Little Frieda Mysteries'' (1997). All were produced and presented by [[Meryl Vladimer]] when she was the artistic director of "the CLUB" at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa, E.T.C.]], and ''[[The Book of Liz]]'' (2002) was produced by  [[Ania A. Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Sedaris also co-authored ''Incident at Cobbler's Knob'', presented and produced by [[David Rockwell]] at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] Festival. Sets for those performances were designed by Sedaris' longtime partner, [[Hugh Hamrick]], who also directed two of them, ''The Book of Liz'' and ''Incident at Cobbler's Knob''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Sedaris and his sister Amy shared "The Talent Family" credit on the latter's short-lived sketch comedy show ''[[Exit 57]]'', while David was a contributing writer.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
