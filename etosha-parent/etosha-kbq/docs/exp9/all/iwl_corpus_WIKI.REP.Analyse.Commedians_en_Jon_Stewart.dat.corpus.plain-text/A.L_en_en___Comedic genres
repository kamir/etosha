[[Comedy]] may be divided into multiple [[genres]] based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered.

These classifications overlap, and most [[comedians]] can fit into multiple genres. For example, [[deadpan]] comics often fall into observational boom comedy, or into black comedy or blue comedy to contrast the morbidity or offensiveness of the joke with a lack of emotion.
