==Plot==
Sonny Koufax ([[Adam Sandler]]) is an unreliable, unmotivated bachelor who lives in [[New York City]] and has declined to take on adult responsibility. He has a degree in law but has chosen not to take the [[bar exam]] since he was awarded $200,000 in a vehicle accident compensation 2 years prior, and lives off his restitution. He is employed, on a [[Part-time job|part-time]] basis only, as a tollbooth attendant, and more or less does this job just to get out of the apartment once in a while.

Finally having enough of Sonny's refusing to grow up, his girlfriend, Vanessa ([[Kristy Swanson]]), tells Sonny that she's going to break up with him unless he can prove to her that he can be a responsible adult. Meanwhile, Sonny's friends, all former schoolmates, are "moving ahead" in their lives. His roommate, Kevin Gerrity ([[Jon Stewart]]), decides to ask his [[podiatrist]] girlfriend Corinne ([[Leslie Mann]]) to marry him the day before he is leaving for [[China]] for his law firm.

Sonny awakes to find five-year-old Julian ([[Cole Sprouse]] and [[Dylan Sprouse]]) abandoned at his and Kevin's apartment, with a written explanation that Julian's mother is now declining to care further for Julian, and that Kevin is his biological father. Sonny notifies Kevin of the situation, which he denies (to the best of his knowledge), and Sonny offers to handle it until he returns from China.  Sonny poses as Kevin and uses Julian as a means to win Vanessa back. However, when Sonny introduces Julian to Vanessa, he finds out that she's already broken up with Sonny and she's now dating a much older man, Sid ([[Geoffrey Horne]]), who's more mature and career-oriented, even having a "5-year plan". 

Sonny then takes Julian to his social worker, Arthur Brooks ([[Josh Mostel]]), telling him that Julian should return to his mother. Brooks tells Sonny that Julian's mother had died of cancer, thus explaining why she sent Julian to be with Kevin. He tells Sonny that they could take Julian, but he would have to live in a group home, which Sonny realizes is the equivalent of an orphanage. Sonny offers to keep Julian temporarily until Brooks finds a foster home for Julian. Sonny then calls his father, Lenny ([[Joseph Bologna]]), who's one of Florida's most respected lawyers, and informs him of his situation. Lenny tells Sonny that he's going to fail taking care of Julian, to which Sonny takes offense. After a conversation with Julian, Sonny decides to raise Julian his own way, giving Julian options instead of orders to let Julian decide for himself, all while teaching Julian new things such as baseball and pro wrestling. Julian also helps Sonny get a potential new girlfriend in Layla ([[Joey Lauren Adams]]), Corinne's sister, who's also a lawyer. This creates friction as Sonny and Corinne do not get along, with Corinne's former occupation as a Hooter's waitress being the primary butt of his jokes.

Soon, Brooks leaves messages for Sonny, saying that a foster home has been found for Julian, but Sonny refuses to call back, having become attached to Julian. Later, at an open house at the school Julian now attends, the teacher tells Sonny that Julian has taken up many bad habits of Sonny's, which causes him to rethink his parenting methods. He's able to turn himself and Julian around, but then Brooks arrives, having learned that Sonny's been posing as Kevin. He orders Sonny to surrender Julian to social services, lest Sonny be arrested for having (technically) kidnapped Julian. Sonny reluctantly gives Julian up and then promptly arranges a court case to determine Julian's future.

In court, with himself and Layla as his counsels, numerous people that Sonny knows testify, telling the judge that he's a suitable father. Even Corinne, who harbors a deep hatred for Sonny, admits that he cares for Julian. Julian testifies as well, not only talking about all the good times he's had with Sonny, but also revealing relevant information regarding his original heritage. As a final attempt to win custody of Julian, Sonny calls himself to the stand and asks his father, who's attending as well, to question him. Lenny quickly gets Sonny to admit to several occasions where he was responsible for someone and was terribly unsuccessful, which he cites as proof that Sonny's not father material. At this point, Sonny quietly tells Lenny that the only reason he's doing this is because Lenny's scared that Sonny will fail, which Sonny assures him that he won't because he loves Julian too much to fail, just like Lenny loves Sonny enough to be scared for him. Seeing Sonny's sincerity, Lenny vouches for Sonny as well. 

Nonetheless, the judge is unconvinced, citing that Sonny, according to law, still kidnapped Julian and orders for his arrest. Kevin, having recalled a drunken fling with a Hooter's girl in Toronto during the 1993 World Series upon hearing Julian's testimony of being five years old with a birthday in July, and originally being from Toronto, realizes that he is Julian's biological father and declares that he will not allow charges against Sonny. Social service and the court agree to award custody to Kevin (pending DNA results). Julian tearfully hugs Sonny, wanting Sonny to be his father. Sonny promises Julian that he will always be his friend and he will always consider Julian part of his family. With that Sonny hands Julian off to Kevin, watching the two slowly start to bond. 
 
One year, three months, and six days later, Sonny's revealed to have turned his life around. He's finally taken his bar exam, is now a lawyer himself and is married to Layla with a child of their own. Julian is also happy with his new life with Kevin and Corinne, who's also more friendly to Sonny now. At Sonny's surprise birthday party at a Hooter's, Sonny finds Vanessa working there as a waitress, with Sid working as a cook, revealing that Sid's "five-year-plan" has gone awry.
