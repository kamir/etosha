'''George Herbert Walker Bush''' (born June 12, 1924) is a retired [[United States|American]] politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|41st]] [[President of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he had previously served as the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|43rd]] [[Vice President of the United States]] (1981–1989), a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]], an ambassador, and [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. He is the oldest living former President and Vice President. He is also the last living former President who is a veteran of [[World War II]]. Bush is often referred to as "George H. W. Bush", "Bush 41", "Bush the Elder", or "George Bush Sr." to distinguish him from his son, former President [[George W. Bush]]. Prior to his son's presidency, he was known simply as George Bush or President Bush.

Bush was born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], to Senator [[Prescott Bush]] and [[Dorothy Walker Bush]]. Following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Bush postponed college, enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest [[naval aviator|aviator]] in the U.S. Navy at the time.<ref name="navy"/><ref name="white house bio"/> He served until the end of the war, then attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to [[West Texas]] and entered the [[petroleum industry|oil business]], becoming a millionaire by the age of 40.

He became involved in politics soon after founding his own oil company, serving as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Director of Central Intelligence]], among other positions. He failed to win the Republican nomination for President in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], but was chosen by party nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] to be his running mate, and the two were elected. During his tenure, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the "[[War on Drugs]]".

In [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]], Bush ran a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]]. [[Foreign policy]] drove the Bush presidency: [[military operations]] were conducted [[United States invasion of Panama|in Panama]] and [[Gulf War|the Persian Gulf]]; the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, and the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved two years later. Domestically, Bush [[Read my lips: no new taxes|reneged on a 1988 campaign promise]] and after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]], along with continuing budget deficits, he lost the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].

Bush left office in 1993. His [[George Bush Presidential Library|presidential library]] was dedicated in 1997, and he has been active—often alongside Bill Clinton—in various humanitarian activities. Bush's eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], later served as the [[List of Governors of Texas|46th]] Governor of [[Texas]] (1995–2000) and as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|43rd]] President of the United States (2001–2009), becoming one of only two presidents—the other being [[John Quincy Adams]]—to be the son of a former president. His second son, [[Jeb Bush]], served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd]] Governor of Florida (1999–2007).

George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm|title=Presidential Avenue: George Bush|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=Presidential Avenue}}</ref> on June 12, 1924 to [[Prescott Bush|Prescott Sheldon Bush]] and [[Dorothy Walker Bush|Dorothy (Walker) Bush]]. The Bush family moved from Milton to [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], Connecticut, shortly after his birth.

Bush began his formal education at the [[Greenwich Country Day School]] in Greenwich. Beginning in 1936, he attended [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he held a number of leadership positions including president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams.<ref name="andover">{{cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm|title=Former President George Bush honored at his 60th reunion at Phillips Academy, Andover|date=June 8, 2002|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=Phillips Academy|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080401131455/http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |archivedate = April 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

===World War II===
Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Bush decided to join the [[United States Navy|US. Navy]],<ref name="navy">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq10-1.htm|title=Lieutenant Junior Grade George Bush, USNR|date=April 6, 2001|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=Naval Historical Center}}</ref> so after graduating from [[Phillips Academy]] in 1942, he became a [[naval aviator]] at the age of 18.<ref name="andover"/> After completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]] on June 9, 1943, just three days before his 19th birthday, which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date.<ref name="navy"/>

He was assigned to Torpedo Squadron (VT-51) as the photographic officer in September 1943.<ref name="navy"/> The following year, his squadron was based on the {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|6}} as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname "Skin".<ref name="Skin">{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2009/01/san-jacinto-veterans-reunite-recall-serving-bush|title=San Jacinto veterans reunite, recall the one they called 'Skin'|last=Adams|first=Kathy|date=January 10, 2009|work=The Virginian Pilot|publisher=Landmark Communications|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref> During this time, the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref name="navy"/>

After Bush's promotion to [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] on August 1, 1944, the ''San Jacinto'' commenced operations against the Japanese in the [[Bonin Islands]]. Bush piloted one of four [[Grumman]] [[TBM Avenger]] aircraft from VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on [[Chichijima]].<ref>"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/20/cp.00.html Story of George H.

December 20, 2003.</ref> His crew for the mission, which occurred on September 2, 1944, included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White.<ref name="navy"/> During their attack, the Avengers encountered intense [[anti-aircraft]] fire; Bush's aircraft was hit by [[flak]] and his engine caught on fire. Despite his plane being on fire, Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target, scoring several damaging hits.<ref name="navy"/> With his engine ablaze, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of the aircraft;<ref name="maam"/> the other man's [[parachute]] did not open.<ref name="navy"/>  Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft, while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarine {{USS|Finback|SS-230|6}}.<ref name="navy"/> For the next month he remained on the ''Finback'', and participated in the rescue of other pilots.

[[File:TBF GeorgeBush.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Bush in his [[TBM Avenger]] on the carrier {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|6}} in 1944]]
Bush subsequently returned to ''San Jacinto'' in November 1944 and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States. Through 1944, he flew 58 combat missions<ref name="maam">{{cite web|url=http://www.maam.org/flightsim/news/tbm_history.htm|title=History's Youngest Naval Aviator: George H. W. Bush|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Air Museum|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}</ref> for which he received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], three [[Air Medal]]s, and the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to ''San Jacinto''.<ref name="navy"/>

Because of his valuable combat experience, Bush was reassigned to [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Navy Base]] and put in a training wing for new torpedo pilots. He was later assigned as a naval aviator in a new torpedo squadron, VT-153, based at [[Naval Air Station Grosse Ile]], Michigan. Upon the Japanese surrender in 1945, Bush was honorably discharged in September of that year.

===Marriage and college years===
George Bush married [[Barbara Bush|Barbara Pierce]] on January 6, 1945, only weeks after his return from the Pacific. The couple's first residence was a small rented apartment in [[Trenton, Michigan|Trenton]], Michigan, near Bush's Navy assignment at [[NAS Grosse Ile]]. Their marriage produced six children: [[George W. Bush|George Walker Bush]] (born 1946), Pauline Robinson "Robin" Bush (1949–1953, died of [[leukemia]]), [[Jeb Bush|John Ellis "Jeb" Bush]] (born 1953), [[Neil Bush|Neil Mallon Bush]] (born 1955), [[Marvin P.

==Business career==
After graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to [[West Texas]]. His father's business connections proved useful as he ventured into the oil business, starting as a sales clerk with [[Dresser Industries]], a subsidiary of [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] (where Prescott Bush had served on the board of directors for 22 years).<ref name="ea">{{cite web|url=http://198.181.165.52/article?assetid=0068080-00&templatename=/article/article.html|title=Bush, George Herbert Walker|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=Scholastic Library Publishing, Inc|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080615195838/http://198.181.165.52/article?assetid=0068080-00&templatename=/article/article.html |archivedate = June 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: [[Odessa, Texas]]; [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Compton, California]]; and [[Midland, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/research/finding_aids/donated_materials/bush_personal_papers.php#zapata_oil |title=George Bush Collection |work=George Bush Presidential Library and Museum |accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> (According to eldest son [[George W.

When the subsidiary became independent in 1958, Bush moved the company from [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] to [[Houston]]. He continued serving as president of the company until 1964, and later chairman until 1966, but his ambitions turned political.<ref name="ea"/> By that time, Bush had become a millionaire.<ref name="msn">{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571000/George_H_W_Bush.html|title=George Herbert Walker Bush|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=MSN Encarta|archivedate=October 31, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257036672964347}} {{wayback|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20091028060726/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571000/George_H_W_Bush.html}}</ref>

==Political career (1964–1980)==

===Congressional years===
Bush served as Chairman of the Republican Party for [[Harris County, Texas]], in 1964, but wanted to be more involved in policy making, so he set his sights high: he aimed for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas.<ref name="ea"/> After winning the Republican primary, Bush faced his opponent, incumbent Democrat [[Ralph W. Yarborough]], who attacked Bush as a right-wing extremist, and Bush lost the general election. The Republican candidate for [[governor of Texas|governor]], [[Jack Crichton (Texas businessman)|Jack Crichton]] of [[Dallas]], a [[Louisiana]] native who often campaigned alongside Bush before the election, lost by a much wider margin to Governor [[John Connally|John B. Connally Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30376 |title=TX US Senate |publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref> It was suggested in PBS's "American Experience" episode about Bush that he and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the New Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb the [[John Birch Society]] members, who were trying to take over the Republican Party and lead it towards a more [[anti-Communist]] direction. Second, during and after the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Democrats in the South who were committed to [[racial segregation|segregation]] left their party, and although the "country club Republicans" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/bush-transcript/ |title=Program Transcript.

[[Gerald Ford]], Nixon's successor, appointed Bush to be Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China. Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and not the People's Republic of China, the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of "ambassador", though he unofficially acted as one. The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial for [[U.S.-China relations]].<ref name="ea"/>

After Ford's accession to the presidency, Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as Vice President. Ford eventually narrowed his list to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and Bush. [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] reportedly preferred Rockefeller over Bush. Rockefeller was finally named and confirmed.<ref name="senate">{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/george_bush.pdf|format=PDF|title=Vice Presidents of the United States: George H.

Bush was again passed over for the vice presidency by Ford when the president chose Bush's future presidential rival, Senator [[Bob Dole]], to replace Rockefeller on the 1976 presidential ticket.

==1980 presidential campaign==
{{See also|United States presidential election, 1980}}
[[File:Reagan-Bush Nashua 1980 debate.jpg|thumb|right|Bush (far right) in the Nashua debate with Reagan (far left) and the moderator]]
Bush had decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980; in 1979, he attended 850 political events and traveled more than {{convert|250000|mi|km}} to campaign for the nation's highest office. In the contest for the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] nomination, Bush stressed his wide range of government experience, while competing against rivals Senator [[Howard Baker]] of Tennessee, Senator [[Bob Dole]] of Kansas, Congressman [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] of Illinois (who would later run as an independent), Congressman [[Phil Crane]], also of Illinois, former Governor [[John Connally]] of Texas, and the front-runner [[Ronald Reagan]], former actor, and [[Governor of California]].<ref name="senate"/>

In the primary election, Bush focused almost entirely on the [[Iowa caucuses]], while Reagan ran a more traditional campaign. Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP, whereas Reagan represented conservatives. Bush famously labeled Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply side]]-influenced plans for massive [[tax cut]]s "[[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]]". His strategy proved useful, to some degree, as he won in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagan's 29.4%. After the win, Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum, or "Big Mo". As a result of the loss, Reagan replaced his [[campaign manager]], reorganized his staff, and concentrated on the [[New Hampshire primary]]. The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by the ''[[Nashua Telegraph]]'', but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagan's microphone turned off, his angry response, "I am paying for this microphone," struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshire's primary with 23% to Reagan's 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.<ref name="senate"/>

With his political future seeming dismal, Bush sold his house in Houston and bought his grandfather's estate in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]], Maine, known as "Walker's Point".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EFDD1630F93BA35754C0A9649C8B63|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 2, 2008|date=July 8, 2002|author=Bumiller, Elisabeth|title=White House Letter; At Parents' Home, Bush Resumes Role of Son}}</ref> At the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]], Reagan selected Bush as his Vice Presidential nominee, placing him on the winning [[United States presidential election, 1980|Republican presidential ticket of 1980]].

==Vice Presidency (1981–1989)==
{{See also|Presidency of Ronald Reagan}}
[[File:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, official portrait.jpg|thumb|Vice Presidential portrait.]]

===First term (1981–1985)===
As Vice President, Bush generally took on a low profile while recognizing the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice President's residence at [[Number One Observatory Circle]], about two miles from the [[White House]]. After selling the house in the [[Tanglewood, Houston|Tanglewood]], the Bushes declared a room in [[The Houstonian Hotel]] in [[Houston]] as their official voting address.<ref name=Hickey/> The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many [[state funeral]]s, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan." As the [[President of the Senate]], Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress, and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.<ref name="senate"/>

[[File:Official portrait of President Reagan and Vice President Bush 1981.jpg|thumb|left|Bush with President Ronald Reagan]]
On March 30, 1981, early into the administration, [[Reagan assassination attempt|Reagan was shot]] and seriously wounded in Washington, D.C. Bush, second in command by the [[presidential line of succession]], was in [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and flew back to Washington immediately. Reagan's cabinet convened in the [[White House Situation Room]], where they discussed various issues, including the availability of the [[Nuclear Football]]. When Bush's plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter, as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack. Bush rejected the idea, responding, "Only the President lands on the South Lawn."<ref name="senate"/> This made a positive impression on Reagan,<ref name="senate"/> who recovered and returned to work within two weeks. From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the [[Oval Office]].

In December 1983 Bush flew to El Salvador and warned that country's military leaders to end their [[death squads]] and hold fully free elections or face the loss of U.S. aid. Bush's aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of [[Álvaro Magaña]]. Bush was never told of the aides' concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of Magaña's personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside.<ref name=nowimp>{{cite web|author=John Solomon |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/03/20/a-wimp-he-wasn-t.html |title=A Wimp He Wasn't |work=Newsweek |date=March 20, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, on [[deregulation]] and international drug smuggling. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government. The drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the United States. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work.<ref name="senate"/>

===Second term (1985–1989)===
Reagan and Bush [[United States presidential election, 1984|ran for reelection in 1984]]. The [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, [[Walter Mondale]], made history by choosing a woman as his running mate, New York Representative [[Geraldine Ferraro]]. She and Bush squared off in [[1984 Vice Presidential Debate|a single televised Vice Presidential debate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27|title=Bush-Ferraro Vice-Presidential Debate|date=October 11, 1984|accessdate=April 3, 2008|publisher=The American Presidency Project|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617164446/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27 |archivedate = June 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Serving as a contrast to the Ivy-League educated Bush, Ferraro represented a "[[blue-collar]]" district in [[Queens]], New York; this, coupled with her popularity among female journalists, left Bush at a disadvantage. The Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide against the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. Early into his second term as Vice President, Bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988. By the end of 1985, a committee had been established and over two million dollars raised for Bush.<ref name="senate"/>

Bush became the first Vice President to serve as [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] when, on July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s from his [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], making Bush acting president for approximately eight hours.

The Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal in 1986, when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran, and had used the proceeds to fund the anticommunist [[Contras]] in Nicaragua, a direct violation of the law. When the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], as it became known, broke to the media, Bush, like Reagan, stated that he had been "out of the loop" and unaware of the diversion of funds,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-transcript.html|title=Transcript|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=April 2, 2008|format=fee required}}</ref> although this was later questioned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm|title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On|date=November 20, 2006|accessdate=April 3, 2008|publisher=George Washington University}}</ref> His diaries from that time stated "I'm one of the few people that know fully the details."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref> Ailes and others were concerned that Bush was seen as a "wimp", an image put to rest by his evident fury in an interview with [[Dan Rather]].<ref name="senate"/>

As Vice President, Bush officially opened the [[1987 Pan American Games]] in [[Indianapolis]].

In 1988 the U.S. accidentally shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]] killing 290 passengers. Bush said that he would "never apologize for the United States of America. Ever. I don’t care what the facts are."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/08/when-should-a-president-say-hes-sorry/ |title=When should a president say he’s sorry?|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

In the January 26, 1987, issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], in an article entitled "Where Is the Real George Bush?" journalist Robert Ajemian reported that a friend of Bush's had urged him to spend several days at [[Camp David]] thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency, to which Bush is said to have responded in exasperation, "Oh, the '''vision thing'''."<ref name="time">{{cite news | last =Ajemian | first =Robert | authorlink = | title =Where Is the Real George Bush? | work=Time | date =January 26, 1987 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963342-2,00.html | accessdate = October 15, 2012}}</ref> This oft-cited quote became a shorthand for the charge that Bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner. The phrase has since become a [[metonym]] for any politician's failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign, and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-a-palermo/meg-whitmans-vision-thing_b_300845.html][http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/sep/29/gordon-brown-speech-labour-conference]</ref>

Bush had been planning a presidential run since as early as 1985, and entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987.<ref name="senate"/> His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], U.S. Representative [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, former Governor [[Pete DuPont]] of [[Delaware]], and conservative Christian [[televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].

Though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC143CF933A25751C0A96E948260|title=Bush and Simon Seen as Hobbled by Iowa's Voting|date=February 10, 1988|accessdate=April 4, 2008|work=The New York Times | first=R.

Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, "yeah, stop lying about my record" in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.<ref name="ea"/> Once the multiple-state primaries such as [[Super Tuesday]] began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.<ref name="msn"/>

Leading up to the [[1988 Republican National Convention]], there was much speculation as to Bush's choice of running mate. Bush chose little-known U.S. Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]], favored by conservatives. Despite Reagan's popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee [[Michael Dukakis]], then [[Governor of Massachusetts]], in most polls.<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html|title=1988: George H.

Bush, occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Known as the "[[thousand points of light]]" speech, it described Bush's vision of America: he endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], [[school prayer|prayer in schools]], [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|gun rights]], and [[United States pro-life movement|opposed abortion]].<ref name="npr"/> The speech at the convention included Bush's famous pledge: "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]."<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/9/newsid_3655000/3655368.stm|title=1988: Bush wins with 'no new taxes' promise|accessdate=April 4, 2008 | date=November 9, 1988}}</ref>

Dukakis's unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates.

Early in his term, Bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover [[United States public debt|deficits]] spawned by the Reagan years. At $220&nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times its size since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the [[101st United States Congress|Democratic controlled Congress]] to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut [[government spending]], and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to [[income tax|raise taxes]], Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.<ref name="msn"/>

In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised "no new taxes" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp [[United States Presidential approval rating|decrease in popularity]]. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.<ref name="msn"/> Near the end of the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the [[capital gains tax]], Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.<ref name="ea"/>

Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.<ref name="msn"/> As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.<ref name="ea"/> The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.

By his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported that 14.2% of all Americans [[poverty rate|lived in poverty]].<ref name="ea"/> At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.<ref name="msn"/>

Bush signed a number of major laws in his presidency, including the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]; this was one of the most pro-[[civil rights]] bills in decades.

===Points of Light===
{{Main|Points of Light}}
President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "[[thousand points of light]]" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."<ref name="President's Report">{{cite book|title=The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation|publisher=Executive Office of the President, 1993|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Points_of_light_movement.html?id=cH8vlwSAjv0C}}</ref>

Four years later in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become."<ref name="President's Report" />

In 1990 the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of [[volunteerism]].<ref name=Perry>{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Suzanne|title=After Two Tough Years, New Points of Light Charity Emerges|journal=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=15 October 2009|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/After-Two-Tough-Years-New/57753/|accessdate=23 May 2013}}</ref> In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the [[Hands On Network]] with the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact.<ref name=Edward>{{cite journal|last=Edward|first=Deborah|title=Getting to Yes: The Points of Light and Hands On Network Merger|journal=RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service, The University of Texas at Austin|year=2008|url=http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2013}}</ref> [[Points of Light]], the organization created through this merger, has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world.

===Daily Point of Light Award===

President Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the [[homeless]].<ref name="President's Report">{{cite book|last=Bush|first=George H.

{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}
In the 1980s, Panamanian leader [[Manuel Noriega]], a once U.S.-supportive leader who was later accused of spying for [[Fidel Castro]] and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56&nbsp;million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.<ref name="rutgers">{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm|title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989|accessdate=April 11, 2008|author=Franklin, Jane|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref> Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.<ref name="texas">{{cite web|title=Prudence in Panama: George H.

In May 1989, Panama held democratic elections, in which [[Guillermo Endara]] was elected president; the results were then annulled by Noriega's government. In response, Bush sent 2,000 more troops to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory (in violation of prior treaties). Bush then removed an embassy and [[United States ambassador|ambassador]] from the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.<ref name="rutgers"/> Noriega suppressed an October [[military coup]] attempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;<ref name="secdef">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm|title=Richard B.

[[File:Bush Gorba P15623-25A.jpg|thumb|Bush and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Helsinki summit in 1990]]

In 1989, just after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], Bush met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in [[Malta Summit|a conference]] on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]]. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the [[Malta]] summit to be a step in the right direction; General [[Brent Scowcroft]], among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be "premature" due to concerns where, according to [[Condoleezza Rice]], "expectations [would be] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [the U.S.] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." But European leaders, including [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev,<ref name="dr rice">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-24/rice1.html|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title=Interview with Dr. Condoleezza Rice|date=December 17, 1997}}</ref> something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989.<ref>See [[Malta Summit]] for more information</ref> Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America.

Another summit was held in July 1991, where the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)]] was signed by Bush and Gorbachev in Moscow. The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the [[INF Treaty|Intermediate Ranged Nuclear Forces Treaty]] by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Union's land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s would be cut by 50%. Bush described START as "a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust".<ref name="bbc moscow">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/31/newsid_4582000/4582773.stm|date=July 31, 1991|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=BBC News |title=1991: Superpowers to cut nuclear warheads}}</ref> After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991, President Bush and Gorbachev declared a U.S.-Russian strategic partnership, marking the end of the [[Cold War]].

Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected." He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: "Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective – a new world order – can emerge: a new era – freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.... A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle.

Early on the morning of January 17, 1991, allied forces launched the first attack, which included more than 4,000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft. This pace would continue for the next four weeks, until a ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991. Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward [[Kuwait City]] while on the west side of the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours. Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power.<ref name="msn"/> Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have "incurred incalculable human and political costs.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/gulfwar.asp|title=A World Transformed|year=2003|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=Snopes.com}}</ref>

Bush's approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive.<ref name="msn"/> Additionally, President Bush and Secretary of State Baker felt the coalition victory had increased U.S. prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. The administration immediately returned to Arab-Israeli peacemaking following the end of the Gulf War; this resulted in the [[Madrid Conference]], later in 1991.<ref>Middle East Review of International Affairs Journal Volume 6, No. 1 – March 2002 [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/jv6n1a7.html Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Limits of Economic Inducements]</ref>

The treaty also restricts patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlines the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.<ref name="fedex">{{cite web|url=http://www.fedex.com/us/customersupport/ftn/faq/nafta.html?link=4 |publisher=Federal Express|title=Frequently Asked Questions: NAFTA|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref>

The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.<ref name="msn"/> NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.<ref name="nafta labor">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title= The NAFTA Labor Side Accord}}</ref> While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html|title=NAFTA|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref>

The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25&nbsp;million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.<ref name="wapo-nafta">{{cite news|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022902608.html | title= Stop Hating on NAFTA|work=The Washington Post|author=Gutierrez, Carlos M|date= March 1, 2008 | accessdate =April 11, 2008}}</ref> With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty, [[Carlos M Gutierrez|Carlos M.

===Pardons===
{{Main|List of people pardoned by George H. W. Bush}}
As other presidents have done, Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]].<ref name="scientists">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm|title=Bush pardons Weinberger, Five Other Tied to Iran-Contra|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref> Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a "true American patriot".<ref name="scientists"/>

In addition to Weinberger, Bush pardoned Duane R. Clarridge, Clair E. George, [[Robert C. McFarlane]], [[Elliott Abrams]], and Alan G.

===1992 presidential campaign===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1992}}
Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, reelection initially looked likely. As a result, many leading Democrats declined to seek their party's presidential nomination. But an economic recession, and doubts of whether Bush ended the Gulf War properly, reduced his popularity.

Conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] challenged Bush for the Republican nomination, and shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote, in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanan's base.<ref name="msn"/> Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his challenger, Democrat and [[Governor of Arkansas]] [[Bill Clinton|William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]]. Clinton attacked Bush as not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being "out of touch" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporter [[Andrew Rosenthal]]'s false report that Bush was "astonished" to see a demonstration of a supermarket [[barcode reader|scanner]].<ref name="snopes">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.htm|title=Maybe I'm Amazed|date=April 1, 2001|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=Snopes.com|archivedate=May 27, 2012|archiveurl=http://archive,is/REsO}}</ref>

[[File:ElectoralCollege1992.svg|300px|thumb|The 1992 presidential electoral votes by state]]
In early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire [[H. Ross Perot]] launched a third party bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient. His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Perot Vote|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}</ref> Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time, then reentered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED71331F934A15753C1A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=The 1992 Campaign: The Independent; Bush Aide calls Perot's story 'paranoid'|date=October 27, 1992|accessdate=April 14, 2008|work=The New York Times|author=Holmes, Steven A}}</ref>

Several factors were key in Bush's defeat. The ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush's loss, as 7 in 10 voters said on election day that the economy was either "not so good" or "poor".<ref>{{cite news|author=R.

Conservative Republicans point to Bush's 1990 agreement to raise taxes in contradiction of his famous "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" pledge. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bush's broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz |title=Clinton Carves a Path Deep Into Reagan Country |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173FF937A35752C1A964958260&scp=1&sq=Clinton+Carves+a+Wide+Path+Deep+Into+Reagan+Country&st=nyt |work=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1992 |accessdate=May 21, 2008 }}</ref> Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s.

In 1993, Bush visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War, where he was targeted in an assassination plot. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people allegedly involved in using a car bomb to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]]. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, in retaliation, Clinton ordered the [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (1993)|firing]] of 23 [[cruise missiles]] at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in [[Baghdad]]. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the UN [[Madeleine Albright]] went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice President [[Al Gore]] said the attack "was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot" to assassinate Bush "was hatched and implemented".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html |title=frontline: the long road to war: assassination |publisher=PBS |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref>

His eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has made [[retronym]]ic forms such as "George H. W. Bush" and "George Bush senior"—and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" much more common.

===Presidential library===
{{Main|George Bush Presidential Library}}
The George Bush Presidential Library is the [[presidential library]] named for Bush. This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice-presidential papers of Bush and the vice-presidential papers of [[Dan Quayle]].<ref name="bushmaterials">{{cite web |title=The Birth of the Tenth Presidential Library: The Bush Presidential Materials Project, 1993–1994|publisher=George Bush Presidential Library |url=http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/giq.html |accessdate=March 22, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410185146/http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/giq.html |archivedate = April 10, 2007}}</ref> It was dedicated on November 6, 1997, and opened to the public shortly thereafter; the architectural firm of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]] designed the complex.

The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum is located on a {{convert|90|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on the west campus of [[Texas A&M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]], on a plaza adjoining the Presidential Conference Center and the Texas A&M Academic Center. The Library operates under [[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]]'s administration and the [http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/laws/1955-act.html Presidential Libraries Act of 1955]'s provisions.

The [[George Bush School of Government and Public Service]] is a graduate [[public policy school]] at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. The graduate school is part of the presidential library complex, and offers four programs: two master's degree programs (''Public Service Administration'' and ''International Affairs'') and two certificate programs (''Advanced International Affairs'' and ''[[Homeland Security]]''). The master's program in International Affairs (MPIA) program offers concentration on either [[National security|National Security]] Affairs or International Economics and [[economic development|Development]].
