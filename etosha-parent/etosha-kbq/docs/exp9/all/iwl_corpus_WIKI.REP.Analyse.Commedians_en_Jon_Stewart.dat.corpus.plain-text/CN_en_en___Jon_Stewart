'''Jonathan''' "'''Jon'''" '''Stewart''' (born '''Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz'''; November 28, 1962)<ref name=tvg>{{cite journal| url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jon-stewart/bio/158563/ | title= Jon Stewart | work=[[TV Guide]] | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> is an American [[comedian]], writer, filmmaker, actor, [[media critic]], and television host. He is the host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a [[news satire|satirical news program]] that airs on [[Comedy Central]].

Stewart started as a stand-up comedian, but branched into television as host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on [[MTV]], called ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and then hosted another show on MTV called ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]''. He has also had several film roles as an actor, but has done few cinematic projects since becoming the host of ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central in early 1999. He is also a writer and co-executive producer of the show. After Stewart joined, ''The Daily Show'' steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, resulting in his nineteen [[Emmy Awards]].

Stewart has gained acclaim as an acerbic, satirical critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular those of the [[U.S. media]] networks such as [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], and [[MSNBC]].<ref name="awards">{{cite web|title=Awards for Jon Stewart|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829537/awards|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}</ref> Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his "[[news satire|fake news]]" desk.<ref name="serious">{{cite web|author=[[Ken Tucker|Tucker, Ken]]|title=You Can't Be Serious!|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|date=November 1, 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/10180/|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}</ref><ref name="CNN041015">{{cite news|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html|title=CNN Crossfire|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> Stewart agrees, saying that neither his show nor his channel purports to be anything other than satire and comedy.  In spite of its self-professed entertainment mandate, ''The Daily Show'' has been nominated for news and journalism [[List of awards won by The Daily Show|awards]]. Stewart hosted the [[78th Academy Awards|78th]] and [[80th Academy Awards]].

Stewart grew up in the era of the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate scandal]], which inspired in him "a healthy skepticism towards official reports". His first job was working at a [[Woolworths]] at which his brother Lawrence worked, and jokingly describes being fired by Lawrence as one of the "scarring events" of his youth.<ref name=TheGuardian/>

Stewart graduated in 1984 from [[The College of William & Mary]] in [[Virginia]], where he played on the [[William & Mary Tribe men's soccer|soccer]] team and initially majored in [[chemistry]] before switching to [[psychology]].<ref name=moment/><ref>{{cite video|date=October 22, 2010|title=Bloomberg Game Changers: Jon Stewart|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/video/63932062/|medium=Television production |publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> While at William & Mary, Stewart became a brother of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] Fraternity,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pikes.org/media/documents/recruitmentresources/brochure/prominent.html|title= Pikes

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2015}}

===Early work===
With a reputation for being a funny man in school,<ref name=moment/><ref name="mtv"/> Jon Stewart returned to [[New York City]] in 1986 to try his hand at the [[comedy club]] circuit, but he could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-27/news/ol-40130_1_jon-stewart|title=He Has Faith in His Jokes|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=McLellan, Dennis|date=May 27, 1993|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> He made his [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] debut at [[The Bitter End]], where his comedic idol, [[Woody Allen]], also began.<ref name="cool">{{cite web|author=Speidel, Maria|url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20107783,00.html|title=Prince of Cool Air|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date= April 4, 1994|accessdate=May 7, 2007}}</ref> He began using the [[stage name]] "Jon Stewart" by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name "Stuart" to "Stewart." He often jokes this is because people had difficulty with the pronunciation of Leibowitz or it "sounded too Hollywood" (a reference to [[Lenny Bruce]]'s joke on the same theme).<ref name="record">{{cite web|url= http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0000record.html|title=Nighttime Talk, MTV Style|publisher=''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]''|author=Howard, Susan|year=1994|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> He has implied that the name change was actually due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom Stewart no longer had any contact.<ref name=oscar>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/26/broadcasting.oscars2006|title=The Oscar for best satirist goes to ...|publisher=The Observer|date=February 26, 2006|author=Harris, Paul|accessdate=October 21, 2008|location=London}}</ref>

Stewart became a regular at the [[Comedy Cellar]], where he was the last performer every night. For two years, he would perform at 2 a.m. while developing his comedic style.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Jon Stewart|episodelink=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|series=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|serieslink=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|network=[[TV Land]]|airdate=March 14, 2007|season=2|number=4}}</ref>
In 1989, Stewart landed his first television job as a writer for ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]''. In 1991, he began co-hosting Comedy Central's ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'', with [[Patty Rosborough]]. In 1992, Stewart hosted the short-lived ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' on MTV, which invited viewers to send in their stories to be acted out by the comedy troupe, [[The State (TV series)|The State]].

Stewart felt his career did not take off until a March 1993 appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.<ref name="ny1994"/> He was considered a finalist to take over Letterman's position upon his departure from the program, but it was instead given to relatively unknown [[Conan O'Brien]].<ref name="record"/>

===''The Jon Stewart Show''===
Later in 1993, Stewart developed ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', a [[talk show]] on [[MTV]]. ''The Jon Stewart Show'' was the first talk show on that network and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show behind ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm|title=New York's Mr. Schmooze|author=Kaplan, Michael|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=February 19, 1994|accessdate=June 21, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm&date=2009-10-26+01:00:29|archivedate=October 26, 2009}}</ref> In 1994, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] canceled ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and, with new corporate sibling MTV (through MTV parent [[Viacom]]'s acquisition of the studio), launched an hour-long [[television syndication|syndicated]] late-night version of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Many local affiliates had moved Hall's show to 2 a.m. during its decline and Stewart's show inherited such early morning time slots in many cities. Ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Among the fans of the show was [[David Letterman]], who was the final guest of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Letterman signed Stewart with his production company, [[Worldwide Pants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0696plaindealer.html|title=Comic Stewart Set to Head CBS Talker|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=June 6, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> Stewart then became a frequent guest host for [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder]]'', which was produced by Letterman and aired after the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' on [[CBS]]. This led to much speculation that Stewart would soon replace Snyder permanently,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_1001usatoday.html|title=Stewart to Sub&nbsp;– Not Take Over&nbsp;– for Snyder|publisher=USA Today|author=Johnson, Peter|date=October 1, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> but Stewart was instead offered the time slot after Snyder, which he turned down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/97_1125nypost.html|title=What's the Deal With Stewart?|publisher=[[New York Post]]|author=Adaliang, Josef|date=November 25, 1997|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref>

In 1996 Stewart hosted the short-lived talk show entitled, "[[Where's Elvis This Week?]]" It was a half-hour, weekly comedy television program that aired on Sunday nights in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two]]. It was filmed at the [[CBS]] Broadcast Center in [[New York City]] and featured a set of panelists, two from the United Kingdom and two from the [[United States]], who discussed news items and cultural issues. The show premiered in the UK on October 6, 1996; five episodes aired in total. Notable panelists included [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Phil Jupitus]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Craig Kilborn]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Armando Iannucci]], [[Norm Macdonald]], and [[Helen Gurley Brown]].

In 1997, Stewart was chosen as the host and interviewer for George Carlin's 10th HBO special, 40 years of Comedy.

===''The Daily Show''===
In 1999, Stewart began hosting ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on Comedy Central when [[Craig Kilborn]] left the show to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. The show, which has been popular and successful in cable television since Stewart became the host (ratings increased by 400% in 1999), blends humor with the day's top news stories, usually in politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians and many newsmakers as well as the news media itself. In an interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda, saying the goal was "schnicks and giggles." "The same weakness that drove me into comedy also informs my show," meaning that he was uncomfortable talking without hearing the audience laugh.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5pK7sK0i4A|title=Jon Stewart on The O'Reilly Factor|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The Daily Show does however inform younger generations of the current world news, and gives this information in a way where it can be informational and comedic. "Stewart does not offer us cynicism for its own sake, but as a playful way to offer the kinds of insights that are not permitted in more serious news formats that slavishly cling to official account of events."<ref>Bennett, Lance W. "Relief in Hard Times: A Defense of Jon Stweart's Comedy in an Age of Cynicism." Critical Studies in Media Communication. 24.3 (2007): 278-283. Print.</ref>

Stewart has since hosted almost all airings of the program, except for a few occasions when correspondents such as [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Rob Corddry]], [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]], [[Steve Carell]], subbed for him, and during [[John Oliver (entertainer)|John Oliver]]'s stint as host during the summer of 2013. Stewart has won a total of nineteen [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for ''The Daily Show'' as either a writer or producer.<ref name="awards"/> In 2005, ''The Daily Show'' and Jon Stewart received a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]] [[Grammy Award]] for the audio book edition of ''[[America (The Book)]]''. In 2000 and 2004, the show won two [[Peabody Award]]s for its coverage of the presidential elections relevant to those years, called "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]" and "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2004|Indecision 2004]]", respectively.

The show of September 20, 2001, the first show after the [[attacks of September 11, 2001]], began with no introduction.<ref name="DS091101">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=105095&title=september-11,-2001|title=The Daily Show of September&nbsp;20, 2001}}</ref> Before this, the introduction included footage of a fly-in towards the [[World Trade Center]] and New York City. The first nine minutes of the show included a tearful Stewart discussing his personal view on the event. His remarks ended as follows:
:"The view… from my apartment… was the World Trade Center… and now it's gone, and they attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity, and strength, and labor, and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The [[Statue of Liberty]]. The view from the [[Lower Manhattan|South of Manhattan]] is now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that."<ref name="DS091101"/>

In mid-2002, amid rumors that [[David Letterman]] was going to switch from CBS to ABC when his contract ran out, Stewart was rumored as Letterman's replacement on CBS.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|title=David Letterman will stay at CBS|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,216668,00.html|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 11, 2002|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}</ref> Ultimately, Letterman renewed his contract with CBS. On the March 9, 2002, episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by Stewart, a "[[Weekend Update]]" sketch poked fun at the situation.

In late 2002, ABC offered Stewart his own talk show to air right before ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]].'' Stewart's contract with The Daily Show was near expiring, and he expressed strong interest. ABC, however, decided to give another Comedy Central figure, [[Jimmy Kimmel]], the pre-''Nightline'' slot.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carter, Bill|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/2002/02_1103nytimes.html|title=In the Land of the Insomniac, the Narcoleptic Wants to Be King|work=The New York Times|date=November 3, 2002}}</ref>

On April 4, 2006, Stewart confronted [[U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] about his decision to appear at [[Liberty University]], an institution founded by [[Jerry Falwell]], whom McCain had previously denounced as one of the "agents of intolerance".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Politics/story?id=1843506|title=Making Right Turn, McCain Embraces Falwell|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=April 14, 2006|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2006/04/john-mccain-on-daily-show.html|title=John McCain on The Daily Show|accessdate=July 26, 2006|last=Madison|first=Lincoln|date=April 5, 2006|work=The Third Path|publisher=Blogspot}}</ref> In the interchange, Stewart asked McCain, "You're not freaking out on us? Are you freaking out on us, because if you're freaking out and you're going into the crazy [[Base (politics)|base]] world—are you going into crazy base world?" McCain replied, "I'm afraid so."

The book sold millions of copies upon its 2004 release and ended the year as a top-fifteen best seller.<ref name="Top15books2004"/>

He landed a minor part in ''[[The First Wives Club]],'' but his [[deleted scene|scene was deleted]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0827usatoday.html|title=Out of the Club|publisher=USA Today|author=Vigoda, Arlene;Susan Wloszczyna|date=August 27, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> In 1995, Stewart signed a three-year deal with [[Miramax]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299594,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Monitor|date=November 17, 1995|accessdate=March 3, 2007}}</ref> He played romantic leads in the films ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' and ''[[Wishful Thinking (1997 film)|Wishful Thinking]]''. He had a supporting role in the romantic comedy ''[[Since You've Been Gone (film)|Since You've Been Gone]]'' and in the horror film ''[[The Faculty]]''. Other films were planned for Stewart to write and star in, but they were never produced. Stewart has since maintained a relationship with Miramax founders [[Harvey Weinstein|Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] and continues to appear in films they have produced including ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', ''[[Doogal]]'' and the documentary ''[[Wordplay (film)|Wordplay]]''.

He appeared in ''[[Half Baked]]'' as an "enhancement smoker" and in ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' as [[Adam Sandler]]'s roommate; he has joked on the ''Daily Show'' and in the documentary ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'' that to get the role he slept with Sandler. Stewart often makes fun of his appearances in the high-profile [[Box office bomb|flop]] ''[[Death to Smoochy]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-02-19-jon-stewart_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA|title=Jon Stewart looks Oscar in the eye|publisher=USA Today|author=Levin, Gary|date=February 19, 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}</ref> in which he played a treacherous television executive, and the animated film ''[[Doogal]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html|title=CNN Larry King Live: Interview With Jon Stewart|work=[[Larry King Live]]|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}</ref> where he played a blue [[Spring (device)|spring]] named Zeebad who shot a freeze ray from his mustache.

Stewart had a recurring role in ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', playing himself as an occasional substitute and possible successor to late-night talk show host [[List of characters on The Larry Sanders Show#Larry Sanders|Larry Sanders]] (played by [[Garry Shandling]]).

===Producing===
In the mid-1990s, Stewart launched his own [[production company]], [[Busboy Productions]], naming the company in reference to his previous job as a [[busboy]]. Stewart signed a deal with [[Miramax]] to develop projects through his company, but none of his ideas have been produced. After Stewart's success as host and producer of ''The Daily Show'', he revived Busboy Productions with ''Daily Show'' producers [[Ben Karlin]] and Rich Korson. In 2002, Busboy planned to produce a [[sitcom]] for NBC starring Stephen Colbert, but the show did not come to fruition.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart: TV Mogul|publisher=[[E!

Comedy Central has a first-look agreement on all projects, after which Busboy is free to shop them to other networks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4762101-1.html|title=Comedy Inks Deal with Stewart's Busboy|author=Larson, Megan|publisher=[[Adweek]]|date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/16/entertainment/et-stewart16|title=Jon Stewart, Comedy Central Sign Deal|author=Boucher, Geoff|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref> The deal spawned the ''Daily Show'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and its replacement ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]''.

===Directing===
In March 2010, Stewart announced that he had optioned rights to the story of journalist [[Maziar Bahari]], who was imprisoned in [[Iran]] for 118 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/optioned-stories-jon-stewart-buys-a-journalists-tale-don-murphy-takes-cory-doctorows-latest-novel/|title=Optioned Stories: Jon Stewart Buys a Journalist's Tale; Don Murphy Takes Cory Doctorow's Latest Novel|accessdate=June 8, 2011|publisher=Slashfilm}}</ref> On the June 6, 2011 episode of ''The Daily Show'', Stewart again hosted Bahari, and in March 2013, he announced that he was leaving the show for 12 weeks to direct the film version of Bahari's 2011 book ''Then They Came For Me.''

On directing, Stewart noted on Lazarus's show that "The Daily Show" influenced his directing process more than his acting gigs did.  He said, "It's about the collaboration. It's about understanding.

So know your intention, know where you're wanting to go with the scene with the way that you want it to go, the momentum shifts, the emphasis, where you want it to be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jon-stewart-is-ready-for-next-iteration-of-the-daily-show-20150220#ixzz3SxWwIEKR|title=Jon Stewart Is Ready for 'Next Iteration' of 'Daily Show' - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref>  He also expressed interest in directing more films.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Hilary|last2=Simmons|first2=Ted|title=Jon Stewart Reveals Hopes For 'Daily Show' Successor, Talks Future Plans|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-stewart-reveals-hopes-daily-775586|website=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

===Hosting and public speaking work===
Stewart has hosted the [[Grammy Award]]s twice, in 2001 and in 2002. In the middle of the 2001 broadcast, after laying a number of comedic duds, Stewart did what he encourages most public officials to do: he recognized his lackluster performance, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say I feel your scorn and accept it." When Stewart returned to host the next year, his comedy was more successful. Joking about the performance of the song "[[Lady Marmalade]]", he said, "Our next performance is from the movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', a film about a time when the whorehouses were about the music!" When the award winners for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] walked up on stage, many in number, Stewart quipped, "I don't know what you may have heard, but you were only supposed to go on stage if you worked on the ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], not if you heard it."

On January 5, 2006, Stewart was officially announced as the host of the [[78th Academy Awards]], which were held March 5 at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Responding to press questions at the time of his selection, Stewart remarked: "As a performer, I'm truly honored to be hosting the show. Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out [[Billy Crystal]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart to Host Oscars|publisher=CBS|date=January 5, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/05/entertainment/main1180403.shtml|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}</ref> (According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Oscar producer [[Gilbert Cates]] knew that Crystal was going to be performing ''700 Sundays'' during the time period and was not able to host.) On the Monday before the Oscars, Stewart told [[Larry King]] that he was more "excited" than nervous about the job and joked that if he turned out a failure, he could be "bumped down to [[Public-access television|public access]]". When asked what the opening would be, the comedian chastised himself by comparing a Stewart opening to a "[[Gene Rayburn]] homage". Instead, the opening segment, preceding Stewart's monologue, featured several recent hosts "declining" to host the show.

Critical response to Stewart's performance was mixed. [[Roger Ebert]] compared him favorably to legendary Oscar host [[Johnny Carson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060305/OSCARS/60306001|author=Ebert, Roger|title='Crash'-ing a joyous Oscar party|publisher=[http://www.rogerebert.com/ RogerEbert.com]|date=March 5, 2006|accessdate=May 7, 2007|authorlink= Roger Ebert}}</ref> Other reviewers were less positive; [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that Stewart hosted with "smug humorlessness." James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said that Stewart was a bad host, but a great "anti-host" in that he poked fun at parts of the broadcast that deserved it, which lent him a degree of authenticity with the non-[[Hollywood]] audience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=Jon Stewart vs. The Oscars|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 6, 2006|url=http://www.time-blog.com/tuned_in/2006/03/jon_stewart_vs_the_oscars.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}</ref> Stewart and correspondent [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] later poked fun at his lackluster reception on ''The Daily Show''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s coverage of the [[79th Academy Awards]] by saying that the "[[demon]] of last year's Oscars had finally been [[exorcism|exorcised]]."

Stewart also hosted the [[80th Academy Awards]] on February 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 25, 2008|work=The New York Times|title=Reviewing Jon Stewart's Starring Role|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/arts/television/25watc.html?gwh=EC81FFF8935496C150A62FEFC2527521|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley}}</ref>

==Stewart's criticism of television journalists==

===''Crossfire'' appearance===
In a televised exchange with then-CNN personality [[Tucker Carlson]] on ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' on October 15, 2004, Stewart criticized the state of television journalism and pleaded with the show's hosts to "stop hurting America", and referred to both Carlson and co-host [[Paul Begala]] as "[[Partisan (political)|partisan]] hacks".<ref name="CNN041015" /><ref>{{cite video|people=Jon Stewart, Tucker Carlson|title=[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]|medium=Television|publisher=CNN|date=2004}}</ref> When posted on the internet, this exchange became widely viewed and was a topic of much media discussion.

Despite being on the program to comment on current events, Stewart immediately shifted the discussion toward the show itself, asserting that ''Crossfire'' had failed in its responsibility to inform and educate viewers about politics as a serious topic. Stewart stated that the show engaged in partisan hackery instead of honest debate, and said that the hosts' assertion that ''Crossfire'' is a debate show is like "saying [[professional wrestling|pro wrestling]] is a show about athletic competition." Carlson responded by saying that Stewart criticizes news organizations for not holding public officials accountable, but when he interviewed [[John Kerry]], Stewart asked a series of "softball" questions (Stewart has acknowledged he voted for Kerry in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/25/ST2008082503384.html|title=No Joke: Jon Stewart Takes Aim At 24-Hour Cable News 'Beast'|publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2010|first=Howard|last=Kurtz}}</ref> Stewart responded that he didn't realize "the news organizations look to ''Comedy Central'' for their cues on integrity." When Carlson continued to press Stewart on the Kerry issue, Stewart said, "You're on CNN! The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?" In response to prods from Carlson, "Come on. Be funny," Stewart said, "No, I'm not going to be your monkey." Later in the show when Carlson jibed, "I do think you're more fun on your show," Stewart retorted, "You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show." In response to Stewart's criticisms, Carlson said, "You need to get a job at a journalism school," to which Stewart responded, "You need to go to one!"<ref name="CNN041015" />

Stewart discussed the incident on ''The Daily Show'' the following Monday:
{{quote|We decided to go to this place, ''Crossfire'', which is a ''nuanced'' public policy analysis show… named after [[Crossfire#"Caught in the crossfire"|the stray bullets that hit innocent bystanders in a gang fight]]. So I go to ''Crossfire'' and, let's face it, I was dehydrated, it's the [[Martin Lawrence#Legal and health problems|Martin Lawrence]] defense… and I had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that I meet on the street that I think that show… um… blows. So I thought it was only the right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program, but here's the thing about confronting someone with that on their show: They're ''there!'' Un''com''fortable! And they were very mad, because apparently, when you invite someone on a show called ''Crossfire'' and you express an opinion, they don't care for that… I told them that I felt their show was hurting America and they came back at me pretty good, they said that I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, "I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow."<ref name="serious"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart, Jon|title=Your Show Blows|publisher=Comedy Central|date=October 18, 2004|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/mr122o/your-show-blows|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref>}}

In January 2005, CNN announced that it was canceling ''Crossfire''. When asked about the cancelations, CNN/U.S.'s incoming president, [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]], referenced Stewart's appearance on the show: "I think he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows, which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Howard Kurtz]]|title=Carlson & 'Crossfire,' Exit Stage Left & Right|publisher=Washington Post|date=January 6, 2004|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52274-2005Jan6.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}</ref>

On March 18, 2009, Carlson wrote a blog entry for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' criticizing Stewart for his handling of the CNBC controversy (see below). Carlson discussed the CNN incident and claimed that Stewart remained backstage for at least "an hour" and "continued to lecture our staff", something Carlson described as "one of the weirdest things I have ever seen."<ref>{{cite web|first=Tucker|last=Carlson|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-18/how-jon-stewart-went-bad|title=How Jon Stewart Went Bad|date=March 18, 2009}}</ref>

===Criticism of CNBC===
{{Main|Jon Stewart's 2009 criticism of CNBC}}
Stewart again became a [[Viral phenomenon|viral internet phenomenon]] following a March 4, 2009, ''The Daily Show'' sequence. CNBC canceled [[Rick Santelli]]'s scheduled appearance but Stewart still ran a short segment showing CNBC giving bad investment advice.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jason Linkins|title=Jon Stewart Eviscerates CNBC, Santelli On Daily Show|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=March 5, 2009|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/jon-stewart-eviscerates-c_n_172057.html|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref>

Subsequent media coverage of exchanges between [[Jim Cramer]], who had been featured heavily in the original segment, and Stewart, led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation on ''The Daily Show''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Matea Gold|title=Exclusive: Jim Cramer set to appear on ''The Daily Show'' Thursday|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 10, 2009|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/exclusive-jim-c.html|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref> The episode received much media attention and became the second most-viewed episode of ''The Daily Show'', trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode. It had 2.3 million total viewers, and the next day, the show's website saw its highest day of traffic in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon Lafayette|title=Stewart-Cramer Confrontation Draws 'Daily's' Second-Biggest Audience of '09|publisher=TVWeek.com|date=March 13, 2009|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/03/stewartcramer_confrontation_dr.php|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref> Although Cramer acknowledged on the show that some of Stewart's criticisms of CNBC were valid and that the network could "do better," he later said on ''[[The Today Show]]'' that Stewart's criticism of the media was "naïve and misleading."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Calderon|first=Michael|title=Cramer slams Stewart: 'naive and misleading'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0309/Cramer_slams_Stewart_naive_and_misleading.html|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}</ref>

===Criticism of Fox News===
Throughout his tenure on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart has frequently accused [[Fox News]] of distorting the news to fit a conservative agenda, at one point ridiculing the network as "the meanest sorority in the world."<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/12/stewart-fox-news-is-the-m_n_496403.html|title=Stewart: Fox News Is The Meanest Sorority In The World|date=March 12, 2010|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=April 25, 2010|first=Dan|last=Abramson}}</ref> In November 2009, Stewart called out Fox News for using some footage from a previous [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally during a report on a more recent rally, making the latter event appear more highly attended than it actually was. The show's anchor, [[Sean Hannity]], apologized for the footage use the following night.<ref name="Hong">{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/archives/184866.asp|title=Video Fix: Jon Stewart catches Fox News using wrong footage|last=Hong|first=Sharon|date=November 11, 2009|publisher=Seattle PI|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> A month later, Stewart criticized ''[[Fox & Friends]]'' cohost [[Gretchen Carlson]]&nbsp;– a former [[Miss America]] and [[Stanford]] graduate&nbsp;– for claiming that she [[google]]d words such as "ignoramus" and "czar". Stewart said that Carlson was dumbing herself down for "an audience who sees intellect as an elitist flaw".<ref name="Carlson episode">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-december-8-2009/gretchen-carlson-dumbs-down|date=December 8, 2009|work=The Daily Show|title=Gretchen Carlson Dumbs Down|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref>

Stewart stepped up his criticism of Fox News in 2010; as of April 24, ''The Daily Show'' had 24 segments criticizing Fox News' coverage.<ref name="Stelter"/> [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of the talk show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on Fox News, countered that ''The Daily Show'' was a "key component of left-wing television" and that Stewart loved Fox News because the network was "not boring".<ref name="Stelter"/>

During an interview with [[Chris Wallace]] on June 19, 2011, Stewart called Wallace "insane" after Wallace said that Stewart's earlier comparison of a Sarah Palin campaign video and an anti-herpes medicine ad was a political comment. Stewart also said Fox viewers are the "most consistently misinformed" viewers of political media.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/19/jon-stewart-fox-news-sunday-video_n_879964.html |title=Jon Stewart LIVE On Fox News, Tells Host 'You're Insane' (VIDEO) [UPDATE&#93; |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> This comment was ranked by fact-checking site [[PolitiFact]] as false, with conditions. Stewart later accepted his error.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most/ |title=Jon Stewart says those who watch Fox News are the "most consistently misinformed media viewers" |publisher=PolitiFact |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, Stewart engaged in an extended "call-out" of Fox News based on their perceived hypocritical coverage of [[food stamps]] and U.S. Government assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/v9wjc4/fox-news-welfare-academy |title=Fox News Welfare Academy - The Daily Show - Video Clip &#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.cc.com |date=March 13, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> This culminated during the [[Cliven Bundy|Cliven Bundy scandal]] involving multiple segments, across multiple episodes, specifically singling out [[Sean Hannity]] and Hannity's coverage of the event. Hannity would then "return fire" by calling out Stewart for associating himself with [[Cat Stevens]] during his Rally in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wemple |first=Erik |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/04/25/no-sean-hannity-you-cant-distance-yourself-from-cliven-bundy/ |title=No, Sean Hannity, you can't distance yourself from Cliven Bundy |publisher=The Washington Post |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> Stewart responded to this by calling out Hannity for frequently calling [[Ted Nugent]] a "friend and frequent guest" on his program and supporting Nugent's violent rhetoric comments towards [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/24/must_see_morning_clip_jon_stewart_calls_sean_hannitys_show_the_arbys_of_news/ |title=Must-see morning clip: Jon Stewart calls Sean Hannity's show "the Arby's of news" |publisher=Salon.com |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> In late August 2014, Stewart vehemently opposed the manner in which Fox News portrayed the events surrounding the shooting of teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri and the subsequent protests from citizens. He especially vilified the network's disregard for the aspect of race and racial tension in this matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/daily-shows-jon-stewart-destroys-fox-news-for-its-ferguson-coverage-9697444.html|title=Daily Show's Jon Stewart destroys Fox News for its Ferguson coverage|work=The Independent|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref>

==Writers Guild of America strike of 2007–2008==
Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of the Comedy Central writers. ''The Daily Show'' writers were the first of Comedy Central's writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2387|title=Comedy Central Writers Win WGA Contract|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America|WGA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/legal-services/4465402-1.html|title=Union Deal for 'Daily Show' Writers|publisher=[[AllBusiness.com]]}}</ref>

Stewart supported the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. On ''The Daily Show'' episode just before the strike, he sarcastically commented about how Comedy Central had made available all episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said, "go support our advertisers". The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late night talk shows. Upon Stewart's return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title ''The Daily Show'', stating that "The Daily Show" was the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show as '''''A''' Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' until the strike ended on February 13, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=January 22, 2013| url=http://weblogs.variety.com/wga_strike_blog/2008/02/wgas-press-rele.html| title=WGA's Press Release| publisher=[[Variety magazine]]| date=February 12, 2008| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080214202305/http://weblogs.variety.com/wga_strike_blog/2008/02/wgas-press-rele.html|archivedate=February 14, 2008| deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Stewart's choice to return to the air and undermine the writers of his show did bring inside criticism from others at the time. [[Seth MacFarlane]] wrote an inside joke into an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' about this, causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the "moral arbiter" of Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Piers|first=Morgan|title=Seth MacFarlane Interview|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrcOge6pMhg|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Other former writers of ''The Daily Show'' such as [[David Feldman (comedian)|David Feldman]] have also indicated that Stewart was anti-union at the time and punished his writers for their decision to unionize.<ref>{{cite web|last=David|first=Feldman|title=Former Daily Show Writer Accuses Jon Stewart of Punishing His Writers For Forming A Union|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union/|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=David|first=Feldman|title=Former Daily Show Writer Accuses Jon Stewart of Punishing His Writers For Forming A Union|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120926234305/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union|archivedate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

The Writers Guild Strike of 2007–08 was also responsible for a notable mock [[The Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud|feud]] between Stewart, [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Conan O'Brien]] in early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]/rivalry in order to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert made the claim that because of "the Colbert bump", he was responsible for [[Mike Huckabee|Mike Huckabee's]] success in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential race]]. O'Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee's success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible for [[Chuck Norris]]' success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O'Brien, since Stewart had featured him on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and in turn the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' with a mock brawl involving the three hosts.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/ Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud], February 5, 2008</ref>

In the December 2003 New Year's edition of ''[[Newsweek magazine|Newsweek]]'', Stewart was named the "Who's Next?" person for 2004, with the magazine predicting that he would emerge as an absolute sensation in that year. (The magazine said they were right at the end of that year.)
