'''Eugene Curran "Gene" Kelly''' (August 23, 1912 – February 2, 1996) was an American [[dance]]r, actor, singer, film director, producer and [[choreographer]]. He was known for his energetic and athletic dancing style, his good looks and the likeable characters that he played on screen.

Best known today for his performances in films such as ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951) ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (1945)  ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), he was a dominant force in [[musical films]] until they fell out of fashion in the late 1950s. His many innovations transformed the Hollywood musical and he is credited with almost single-handedly making the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.<ref name="Billman" /> Kelly was the recipient of an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1952 for his career achievements. He later received lifetime achievement awards in the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] (1982), and from the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[American Film Institute]]; in 1999, the American Film Institute also numbered him 15th in their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|Greatest Male Stars of All Time]] list.

==Early life==
[[File:GKellyPittSeniorYB.jpg|thumb|left|Kelly's senior picture from the 1933  yearbook of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]]]
Kelly was born in the [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]].

He entered [[Pennsylvania State College]] as a journalism major, but the 1929 crash forced him to work to help his family. He created dance routines with his younger brother Fred to earn prize money in local talent contests. They also performed in local nightclubs.<ref name="Thomas" />

In 1931, Kelly enrolled at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] to study economics, joining the [[Phi Kappa Theta]] fraternity.<ref name="Hirschhorn">{{cite book | last=Hirschhorn | first=Clive | title=Gene Kelly – a Biography | publisher=W.H.

In 1932, the studio was renamed The Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance. A second location was opened in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] in 1933. Kelly served as a teacher at the studio during both his undergraduate and law student years at Pitt. In 1931, he was approached by the [[Rodef Shalom Temple|Rodef Shalom synagogue]] in Pittsburgh to teach dance, and to stage the annual Kermess. This venture was successful enough that his services were retained for seven years until his departure for New York.<ref>cf. Hirschhorn, p.33.</ref> Eventually, though, he decided to pursue his career as a dance teacher and full-time entertainer, so Kelly dropped out of law school after two months. He began to increasingly focus on performing and later claimed: "With time I became disenchanted with teaching because the ratio of girls to boys was more than ten to one, and once the girls reached sixteen the dropout rate was very high."<ref name="Thomas" /> In 1937, having successfully managed and developed the family's dance school business, he finally did move to [[New York City]] in search of work as a choreographer.<ref name="Thomas" /> Gene returned to Pittsburgh to his family home where he had grown up, 7514 Kensington St, by 1940 and worked as a theatrical actor.<ref>1940 US Census via Ancestry.com</ref>

==Stage career==
After a fruitless search, Kelly returned to Pittsburgh, to his first position as a choreographer with the Charles Gaynor musical revue ''Hold Your Hats'' at the [[Pittsburgh Playhouse]] in April, 1938. Kelly appeared in six of the sketches, one of which, "La Cumparsita", became the basis of an extended Spanish number in ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)]]'' eight years later.

His first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] assignment, in November 1938, was as a dancer in [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Leave It to Me!]]'' as the American ambassador's secretary who supports [[Mary Martin]] while she sings "[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy]]". He had been hired by [[Robert Alton]] who had staged a show at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and been impressed by Kelly's teaching skills. When Alton moved on to choreograph ''One for the Money'' he hired Kelly to act, sing and dance in a total of eight routines. In 1939, he was selected to be part of a musical revue "One for the Money" produced by the actress [[Katharine Cornell]], who was known for finding and hiring talented young actors. Kelly's first career breakthrough was in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'', which opened on October 25, 1939, where for the first time on Broadway he danced to his own choreography. In the same year he received his first assignment as a Broadway choreographer, for ''[[Billy Rose]]'s Diamond Horseshoe''. [[Betsy Blair]] was a member of the cast. He began dating Blair, and they married on October 16, 1941.

In 1940, he was given the leading role in [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', again choreographed by Robert Alton, and this role propelled him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique get in the way of mood or continuity."<ref name="Thomas" /> It was at this time also, that his phenomenal commitment to rehearsal and hard work was noticed by his colleagues. [[Van Johnson]] who also appeared in ''Pal Joey'' recalled: "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene."<ref name="Thomas" /> Offers from Hollywood began to arrive but Kelly was in no particular hurry to leave New York. Eventually, he signed with [[David O. Selznick]], agreeing to go to Hollywood at the end of his commitment to ''Pal Joey'', in October 1941. Prior to his contract, he also managed to fit in choreographing the stage production of ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]''.

==Film career==

===1941–1945: Becoming established in Hollywood===
[[File:Gene Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse ("Anchors Aweigh", 1945).gif|right|thumb|Gene Kelly dancing with [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] in ''Anchors Aweigh'' (1945)]]
Selznick sold half of Kelly's contract to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] for his first motion picture: ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'' (1942) starring box-office champion [[Judy Garland]]. Kelly claimed to be "appalled at the sight of myself blown up twenty times. I had an awful feeling that I was a tremendous flop". ''For Me and My Gal'' performed very well and, in the face of much internal resistance, [[Arthur Freed]] of MGM picked up the other half of Kelly's contract.<ref name="Thomas" /> After appearing in a cheap B-movie drama ''[[Pilot no. 5|Pilot #5]]'' and in ''[[Christmas Holiday]]'' he took the male lead in Cole Porter's ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|Du Barry Was a Lady]]'' opposite [[Lucille Ball]] (in a part originally intended for [[Ann Sothern]]). His first opportunity to dance to his own choreography came in his next picture ''[[Thousands Cheer]]'', where he performed a mock-love dance with a mop.

He achieved his breakthrough as a dancer on film when MGM loaned him out to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] to work with [[Rita Hayworth]] in ''[[Cover Girl (film)|Cover Girl]]'' (1944), where he created a memorable routine dancing to his own reflection. Despite this, noted critic [[Manny Farber]] was moved to praise Kelly's "attitude," "clarity," and "feeling" as an actor while inauspiciously concluding, "The two things he does least well - singing and dancing - are what he is given most consistently to do."<ref>Farber, Manny, The New Republic, May 15, 1944, as reprinted in 'Farber on Film,' Library of America, 2009, pg. 163</ref> At the end of 1944, Kelly enlisted in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval Air Service]] and was commissioned as [[lieutenant junior grade]]. He was stationed in the Photographic Section, Washington D.C., where he was involved in writing and directing a range of documentaries, and this stimulated his interest in the production side of film-making.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /><ref>According to Blair, p.111, he directed [[Jocelyn Brando]] in a semi-documentary about war-wounded veterans.</ref>

In Kelly's next film ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (1945), MGM virtually gave him a free hand to devise a range of dance routines, including the celebrated animated dance with [[Tom and Jerry|Jerry Mouse]], and his duets with co-star [[Frank Sinatra]]. The iconic performance was enough for Manny Farber to completely reverse his previous assessment of Kelly's skills; reviewing the film, Farber enthused, "Kelly is the most exciting dancer to appear in Hollywood movies."<ref>Farber, Manny, The New Republic, August 27, 1945, as reprinted in 'Farber on Film,' Library of America, 2009, pg. 255</ref>  ''Anchors Aweigh'' became one of the most successful films of 1945 and it garnered Kelly his first and only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. In ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946) – which was produced in 1944 but not released until 1946 – Kelly collaborated with [[Fred Astaire]] – for whom he had the greatest admiration – in the famous "The Babbitt and the Bromide" challenge dance routine.

===1946–1952: MGM===
On his return to Hollywood in the spring of 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used him in a routine, black-and-white movie: ''[[Living in a Big Way]]''. The film was considered so weak that Kelly was asked to design and insert a series of dance routines, and his ability to carry off such assignments was noticed. This led to his next picture with [[Judy Garland]] and director [[Vincente Minnelli]], a musical film version of [[S.N. Behrman]]'s play  ''[[The Pirate]]'', with songs by [[Cole Porter]], in which Kelly plays the lead. ''The Pirate'' gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism and is probably best remembered for Kelly's work with [[The Nicholas Brothers]] – the leading black dancers of their day – in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was ahead of its time, but was a box-office flop.

[[File:Gene Kelly in Take Me Out to the Ball Game trailer.jpg|thumb|''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' (1949)]]
Although MGM wanted Kelly to return to safer and more commercial vehicles, he ceaselessly fought for an opportunity to direct his own musical film. In the interim, he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]''. and also appeared with [[Vera-Ellen]] in the ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' ballet in ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948). He was due to play the male lead opposite Garland in ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), but broke his ankle playing volleyball. He withdrew from the film and convinced [[Fred Astaire]] to come out of retirement to replace him.<ref name="Astaire">{{cite book|last = Astaire|first = Fred|title = Steps in Time|publisher = Heinemann|year = 1959|location = London|pages = 291|isbn = 0-241-11749-6 }}</ref> There followed ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' (1949), his second film with Sinatra, where Kelly paid tribute to his Irish heritage in ''The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day'' routine. It was this musical film which persuaded Arthur Freed to allow Kelly to make ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', where he partnered with Frank Sinatra for the third and final time, creating a breakthrough in the musical film genre which has been described as "the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in Hollywood."<ref name="Thomas" />

[[Stanley Donen]], brought to Hollywood by Kelly to be his assistant choreographer, received co-director credit for ''On the Town''. According to Kelly: "...when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one to work with the cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, [[Carol Haney]] and [[Jeanne Coyne]] I could never have done these things. When we came to do ''On the Town'', I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators."<ref name="Thomas" /><ref>Blair, p.104: "Gene was the central creative force in this initial collaboration, but he was always generous about Stanley's contribution...Unfortunately, and mysteriously for me, Stanley, over the years, had been less than gracious about Gene"</ref> Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the "Day in New York" routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.<ref name="Hirschhorn" />

[[File:Gene Kelly American in Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951)]]
Kelly asked the studio for a straight acting role and he took the lead role in the early [[mafia]] melodrama: ''[[Black Hand (1950 film)|Black Hand]]'' (1950). This exposé of organized crime is set in New York's "Little Italy" during late 19th century, and focuses on the Black Hand, a group which extorts money upon threat of death. In real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain. Even in 1950, however, Hollywood had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime, it being safer to go after a "dead" criminal organization than a "live" one. There followed ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950) – Garland's last musical film for MGM – in which Kelly performed the celebrated "You, You Wonderful You" solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky floorboard. In his book "Easy the Hard Way", [[Joe Pasternak]], head of one of the other musical units within MGM, singled out Kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing Garland to complete her part.<ref name="Thomas" />

[[File:Singin Rain.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952)]]
There followed in quick succession two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' (1951) and – probably the most popular and admired of all film musicals – ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. [[Johnny Green]], head of music at MGM at the time, described him as follows:<blockquote>"Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was [[Louis B. Mayer]] or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted".<ref name="Thomas" /></blockquote> ''An American in Paris'' won six Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and, in the same year, Kelly was presented with an honorary Academy Award for his contribution to film musicals and the art of choreography. The film also marked the debut of [[Leslie Caron]], who Kelly had spotted in Paris and brought to Hollywood. Its dream ballet sequence, lasting an unprecedented seventeen minutes, was the most expensive production number ever filmed up to that point. It was described by [[Bosley Crowther]] as, "''whoop-de-doo'' ... one of the finest ever put on the screen."<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> ''Singin' in the Rain'' featured Kelly's celebrated and much imitated solo dance routine to the title song, along with the "Moses Supposes" routine with [[Donald O'Connor]] and the "Broadway Melody" finale with [[Cyd Charisse]]. Though the film did not initially generate the same enthusiasm as ''An American in Paris'', it subsequently overtook the earlier film to occupy its current pre-eminent place among critics and filmgoers alike.<ref>In 1994, [[Kurt Browning]], offered an ice skating interpretation of "Singin' in the Rain" on his television special ''You Must Remember This''. In 2005, Kelly's widow gave permission for [[Volkswagen]] to use his likeness to promote the [[Golf GTi]] car. The advertisement, shown only outside the US, used [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to mix footage of Gene Kelly, from ''Singin' in the Rain'', with footage of professional breakdancer [[David Elsewhere]].</ref>

===1953–57: The Decline of the Hollywood Musical===
Kelly, at the very peak of his creative powers, now made what in retrospect is seen as a serious mistake.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM which sent him to Europe for nineteen months and used MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. Only one of these pictures was a musical, ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956. When Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was already beginning to feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture ''[[Brigadoon (film)|Brigadoon]]'' (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing the film to be made on studio backlots instead of on location in [[Scotland]]. This year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the celebrated "I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen" routine in ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]''. MGM's refusal to loan him out for ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract which involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' (1956) co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to "I Like Myself", and a dance trio with [[Michael Kidd]] and [[Dan Dailey]] which allowed Kelly to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of [[Cinemascope]]. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal and as a result ''It's Always Fair Weather'' "premiered" at seventeen drive-in theatres around the [[Los Angeles]] metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, ''[[Les Girls]]'' (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[Kay Kendall]] and [[Taina Elg]]. It too sold few movie tickets. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film ''[[The Happy Road]]'', set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly returned to stage work.

===1958–1996: After MGM===
[[File:Inherit the wind trailer (5) Gene Kelly.jpg|thumb|Kelly as Hornbeck in ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'']]
In 1958, he directed [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s musical play ''[[Flower Drum Song]]''.<ref>In an episode foreshadowing his later conflicts with the studio, [[Elia Kazan]] in the late 1940s offered Kelly the role of Biff in ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' on Broadway, but MGM refused to release him. cf. Blair, p.112</ref> Early in 1960, Kelly, an ardent Francophile and fluent French speaker, was invited by A. M. Julien, the general administrator of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opéra]] and [[Opéra-Comique]],<ref name="Thomas" /> to select his own material and create a modern ballet for the company, the first time an American had received such an assignment. The result was ''Pas de Dieux'', based on [[Greek mythology]], combined with the music of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]''. It was a major success, and led to his being honored with the Chevalier of the [[Legion d'Honneur]] by the French Government. Kelly continued to make some film appearances, such as Hornbeck in the 1960 Hollywood production of ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''. However, most of his efforts were now concentrated on film production and directing. In 1962, he directed [[Jackie Gleason]] in ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' in Paris, but the film was drastically re-cut by [[Seven Arts Productions]] and flopped.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> Another French effort, [[Jacques Demy]]'s homage to the MGM musical: ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967) in which Kelly appeared, was popular in France and nominated for Academy Awards for Best Music and Score of a Musical Picture (Original or Adaptation) but performed poorly, elsewhere. He appeared as himself in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' (1960).

He was asked to direct the film, Sound of Music, which had been turned down earlier by [[Stanley Donen]]. He escorted Ernest Lehman out of his house saying "Go find someone else to direct this piece of shit."<ref>http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-sound-of-music-story-by-tom-santopietro-1425069491</ref>

His first foray into television was a documentary for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]'', ''Dancing is a Man's Game'' (1958) where he assembled a group of America's greatest sportsmen – including [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and [[Bob Cousy]] – and re-interpreted their moves choreographically, as part of his lifelong quest to remove the effeminate stereotype of the art of dance, while articulating the philosophy behind his dance style.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> It gained an [[Emmy]] nomination for choreography and now stands as the key document explaining Kelly's approach to modern dance. Kelly also frequently appeared on television shows during the 1960s, but his one effort at television series, as Father Chuck O'Malley in ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'' (1962–63), based on the [[Going My Way|Best Picture of 1944]] starring [[Bing Crosby]], was dropped after thirty episodes, although it enjoyed great popularity in Roman Catholic countries outside of the United States.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> He also appeared in three major TV specials: ''New York, New York'' (1966), ''The Julie Andrews' Show'' (1965), and ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' (1967) a show he produced and directed which returned to a combination of cartoon animation with live dance, winning him an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Children's Program. In 1963, Kelly joined [[Universal Pictures]] for a two-year stint. He joined [[20th Century Fox]] in 1965, but had little to do – partly due to his decision to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons. His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'' (1967) where he directed [[Walter Matthau]]. Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox – buoyed by the returns from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) – commissioned Kelly to direct ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1969), again directing Matthau along with [[Barbra Streisand]]. The film earned 3 Academy Awards and was nominated for 7 including one for Best Picture.

In 1970, he made another TV special: ''Gene Kelly and 50 Girls'' and was invited to bring the show to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], which he duly did for an eight-week stint – on condition he be paid more than any artist had hitherto been paid there.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> He directed veteran actors [[James Stewart]] and [[Henry Fonda]] in the comedy western ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]]'' (1970) which performed poorly at the box-office. In 1973, he would work again with [[Frank Sinatra]] as part of Sinatra's [[Emmy]] nominated TV special ''[[Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra]]''. Then, in 1974, he appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit of the year ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' and subsequently directed and co-starred with his friend [[Fred Astaire]] in the sequel ''[[That's Entertainment, Part II]]'' (1976). It was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77-year-old Astaire – who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing, having long since retired – into performing a series of song and dance duets, evoking a powerful nostalgia for the glory days of the American musical film. Kelly continued to make frequent TV appearances and, in 1980, appeared in an acting and dancing role with [[Olivia Newton-John]] in ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980), an expensive theatrical flop which has since attained a cult following.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> In Kelly's opinion, "The concept was marvelous but it just didn't come off."<ref name="Thomas" /> In the same year, he was invited by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] to recruit a production staff for American Zoetrope's ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1982). Although Coppola's ambition was for him to establish a production unit to rival the [[Arthur Freed|Freed Unit]] at MGM, the film's failure put an end to this idea.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> In 1985, Kelly served as executive producer and co-host of ''[[That's Dancing!]]'' – a celebration of the history of dance in the American musical. Kelly's final on-screen appearance was to introduce ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]''. His final film project was in 1994 for the animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', released in 1997 and dedicated to him, on which Kelly acted as an uncredited choreographic consultant.

==Working methods and influence on filmed dance==
When he began his collaborative film work, he was influenced by [[Robert Alton]] and [[John Murray Anderson]], striving to create moods and character insight with his dances. He choreographed his own movement, along with that of the ensemble, with the assistance of [[Jeanne Coyne]], [[Stanley Donen]], [[Carol Haney]] and Alex Romero.<ref name="Billman">{{cite book | last=Billman | first=Larry | title=Film Choreographers and Dance Directors  | publisher=McFarland and Company | year=1997 | location=North Carolina | pages=374–376 | isbn=0-89950-868-5 }}</ref> He experimented with lighting, camera techniques and special effects in order to achieve true integration of dance with film, and was one of the first to use split screens, double images, live action with animation and is credited as the person who made the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.<ref Name="Billman" />

There was a clear progression in his development, from an early concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms.<ref name="Delamater">{{cite encyclopedia | last=Delamater | first=Jerome | authorlink= | title=Gene Kelly | encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of Dance | volume=vol. 1 | pages=38–40 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2004 | url= | accessdate= }}</ref> Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: "I don't have a name for my style of dancing...It's certainly hybrid...I've borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance – tap-dancing, jitterbugging...But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which I was reared."<ref name="Delamater" /> He especially acknowledged the influence of [[George M. Cohan]]: "I have a lot of Cohan in me. It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness – which is a good quality for a male dancer to have."<ref name="Thomas" /> He was also heavily influenced by an [[African-American]] dancer Dancing Dotson, whom he saw at [[Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts|Loew's Penn Theatre]] around 1929, and was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York.<ref>cf. Hirschhorn, p.25,26: "What impressed Gene was the originality of the man's [Dotson's] dancing, as it was quite unlike anything he'd seen before. The tricks Dotson was doing were absolutely fresh. He went back to see that act a couple of times, and admitted pinching several steps for his own use...Just as he had done with Dotson, Gene made up his mind to 'steal' as much as he could from numerous touring shows...both he and Fred were absolutely shameless when it came to pilfering, and very good at it."</ref> However, his main interest was in [[ballet]], which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early Thirties. As biographer [[Clive Hirschhorn]] explains: "As a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods – anywhere, just as long as he could feel the wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression."<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, [[Rita Hayworth]]'s uncle.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /> Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance – as in the title song from ''Singin' in the Rain'' or "I Got Rhythm" from ''An American in Paris'', whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in "Heather on the Hill" from ''Brigadoon'' or "[[Our Love Is Here to Stay]]" from ''An American in Paris''.<ref name="Delamater" />

[[File:Kelly in rehearsal.jpg|thumb|Kelly in rehearsal with [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and assistant [[Jeanne Coyne]] in the [[NBC]] ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' television special ''Dancing is a Man's Game'' (1958)]]
According to Delamater, Kelly's work "seems to represent the fulfillment of dance-film integration in the 1940s and 1950s". While [[Fred Astaire]] had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing. Kelly's reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer a greater number of directions in which to move. Examples of this abound in Kelly's work and are well illustrated in the "Prehistoric Man" sequence from ''On the Town'' and "The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day" from ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game''.<ref name="Delamater" /> In 1951, he summed up his vision as follows: "If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, this must be the focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background. To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, ''your eye''".<ref name="Billman" />

Kelly's athleticism gave his moves a distinctive broad, muscular quality,<ref name="Delamater" /> and this was a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: "There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete...I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman."<ref name="Thomas" /> He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, "tragically" stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: "Dancing ''does'' attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately people confuse gracefulness with softness. [[John Wayne]] is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies."<ref name="Thomas" /> In his view, "one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine."<ref name="Thomas" /> He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as ''Dancing: A Man's Game'' (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.<ref name="Thomas" />

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer [[Betsy Blair]] explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles...he democratized the dance in movies."<ref>Blair, p.176</ref> In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the Manor born — I put them on and look like a truck driver."<ref name="Thomas" />

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:Gene Kelly Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Kelly, photographed by [[Allan Warren]], in 1986]]
Kelly married actress [[Betsy Blair]] in 1941; they had one child, Kerry, and divorced in April 1957.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2gcjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=979,473011&dq=gene+kelly+betsy&hl=en|title=Marriage Ends For Gene Kelly, Actress Wife|date=1957-04-04|work=The Palm Beach Post|page=10|accessdate=2012-12-07}}</ref>

In 1960, Kelly married his choreographic assistant [[Jeanne Coyne]], who had divorced [[Stanley Donen]] in 1949 after a brief marriage. He remained married to Coyne until her death in 1973. They had two children, Bridget and Tim. He was married to Patricia Ward from 1990 until his death in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/03/movies/gene-kelly-dancer-of-vigor-and-grace-dies.html?pagewanted=5&src=pm|title=Gene Kelly, Dancer of Vigor and Grace, Dies|last=Krebs|first=Albin|date=1996-02-03|publisher=nytimes.com|page=5|accessdate=2012-12-07}}</ref>

===Political and religious views===
Kelly was a lifelong supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. His period of greatest prominence coincided with the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] in the U.S. In 1947, he was part of the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], the Hollywood delegation which flew to Washington to protest at the first official hearings by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. His first wife, Betsy Blair, was suspected of being a Communist sympathizer and when United Artists, who had offered Blair a part in ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955), were considering withdrawing her under pressure from the [[American Legion]], Kelly successfully threatened MGM's influence on United Artists with a pullout from ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' unless his wife was restored to the part.<ref name="Hirschhorn" /><ref name="Blair">{{cite book | last=Blair | first=Betsy | title=The Memory of All That | publisher=Elliott & Thompson | year=2004 | location=London | pages= | isbn=1-904027-30-X }}</ref> He used his position on the board of directors of the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] on a number of occasions to mediate disputes between unions and the Hollywood studios.

He was raised as a Roman Catholic, and he was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the [[Catholic Motion Picture Guild]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].<ref>[http://www.goodshepherdbh.org/a-city-on-a-hill/our-history/ Church of the Good Shepherd: Our History]</ref> However, after becoming disenchanted by the Roman Catholic Church's support for [[Francisco Franco]] against the Spanish Republic,<ref name=ipkmpz>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MKY/is_10_29/ai_n13807354/ | work=Catholic New Times | title=Gene Kelly: cultural icon | year=2005}}</ref> he officially severed his ties with the church in September 1939. This separation was prompted, in part, by a trip Kelly made to Mexico in which he became convinced of the Church’s failure in helping the poor.<ref name=ipkmpz /> After his departure from the Catholic Church, Kelly became an agnostic and remained so for the rest of his life.<ref>Yudkoff, Alvin ''Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams'', Watson-Guptill Publications: New York, NY (1999) pages 58–59</ref> He retained a lifelong passion for sports and relished competition. He was known as a big fan of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[New York Yankees]]. From the mid-1940s through the early 1950s, he and Blair organized weekly parties at their [[Beverly Hills]] home, and they often played an intensely competitive and physical version of [[charades]], known as "The Game".<ref name="Blair" />

After his death it was reported that Kelly had donated money to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) during the 1970s.<ref name="highbeam">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60883541.html|title=Hollywood legend Gene Kelly handed thousands to the IRA.(News) - Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland) &#124; HighBeam Research|publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref><ref name="thefreelibrary">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hollywood+legend+Gene+Kelly+handed+thousands+to+the+IRA.-a060883541|title=Hollywood legend Gene Kelly handed thousands to the IRA. - Free Online Library|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref> His papers are currently housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at [[Boston University]].

==Illness and death==
Kelly's health declined steadily in the late 1980s; a [[stroke]] in July 1994 resulted in a seven-week hospital stay and another stroke in early 1995 left Kelly mostly bedridden in his Beverly Hills home. He died in his sleep at 8:15&nbsp;a.m. on February 2, 1996 and his body was cremated, without funeral or memorial services.<ref name=blair>cf. Blair, p.8: "Kerry later told me that they all felt as if she [Patricia Ward, Kelly's wife at the time of his death] 'threw him away – as if he were garbage to be incinerated and thrown away. There aren't even any ashes'. His children, who loved him, never even got to say goodbye to their father. It would have saddened and, I imagine, enraged him because he loved his children deeply."</ref>
