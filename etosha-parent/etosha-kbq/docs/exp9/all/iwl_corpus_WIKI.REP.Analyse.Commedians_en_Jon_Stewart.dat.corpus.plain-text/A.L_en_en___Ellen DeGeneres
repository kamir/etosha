'''Ellen Lee DeGeneres''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɨ|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ər|ə|s}}; born January 26, 1958)<ref name=filmref /> is an American comedian, television host, actress, writer, and producer.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Monitor|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=Jan 25 – February 1, 2013|issue=1243/1244|page=36}}</ref> She starred in the popular sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' from 1994 to 1998, and has hosted her [[Television syndication|syndicated]] TV talk show, ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]],'' since 2003.

Her stand-up career started in the early 1980s, culminating in a 1986 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] likened her to [[Bob Newhart]], and invited her for an onscreen chat after her set; DeGeneres was the first female comedian invited by the iconic host to join him for such a discussion, at a time when such an invitation was widely regarded as one of the most influential endorsements available for a comic. As a film actress, DeGeneres starred in ''[[Mr. Wrong]]'' (1996), appeared in ''[[EDtv]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Love Letter (1999 film)|The Love Letter]]'' (1999), and provided the voice of Dory in the [[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), for which she was awarded the [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress]], the first time an actress won a Saturn Award for a voice performance. In 2010 she was a judge on ''[[American Idol]]'' for its [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]].

She starred in two television sitcoms, ''Ellen'' from 1994 to 1998, and ''[[The Ellen Show]]'' from 2001 to 2002. During the fourth season of ''Ellen'' in 1997, she [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian in an appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. Shortly afterward, her character, Ellen Morgan, also came out to a therapist played by Winfrey, and the series went on to explore various [[LGBT]] issues, including the coming-out process. This made her the first openly lesbian actress to play an openly lesbian character on television.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/blog/?p=5903</ref> In 2008, she married her longtime girlfriend [[Portia de Rossi]].

DeGeneres has hosted the [[Academy Awards]], [[Grammy Awards]], and the [[Primetime Emmys]]. She has authored three books and started her own record company, [[Eleveneleven]].

==Film career==

[[File:EllenDeGeneres1997Emmies.jpg|right|thumb|Ellen DeGeneres at the Emmy Awards, September 1997]]
Ellen's work in the late 1980s and early 1990s included the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]''. DeGeneres starred in a series of films for a show named ''[[Ellen's Energy Adventure]]'', which is part of the [[Universe of Energy]] attraction and pavilion at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]]. The film also featured [[Bill Nye]], [[Alex Trebek]], [[Michael Richards]], and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. The show revolved around DeGeneres' falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and [[Albert Einstein]]. The next film had DeGeneres co-hosting an educational look at energy with Nye. The ride first opened on September 15, 1996, as ''Ellen's Energy Crisis'', but was quickly given the more positive-sounding name ''Ellen's Energy Adventure''.

==Television career==

DeGeneres's first regular TV role was in a short-lived Fox sitcom called ''[[Open House (TV series)|Open House]]''. She played the role of Margo Van Meter, an office worker at the Juan Verde Real Estate company. The show co-starred [[Alison LaPlaca]] and [[Mary Page Keller]]. In 1992, producers [[Neal Marlens]] and [[Carol Black]] cast DeGeneres in their sitcom ''[[Laurie Hill]]'', in the role of Nurse Nancy MacIntyre. The series was canceled after only four episodes, but Marlens and Black were so impressed with DeGeneres' performance that they soon cast her in their next ABC pilot, ''These Friends of Mine'', which they co-created with [[David S. Rosenthal]].

[[File:Ellen DeGeneres 2.jpg|thumb|At the Governor's Ball after the 46th Annual Emmy Awards telecast, September 1994]]
DeGeneres's comedy material became the basis of the successful sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', named ''These Friends of Mine'' during its first season. The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres's style of [[observational comedy|observational humor]]; it was often referred to as a "female ''[[Seinfeld]]''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=3|title=GLBT History Month – Ellen DeGeneres|accessdate=November 28, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

''Ellen'' reached its height of popularity in February 1997, when DeGeneres came out as a lesbian on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. That April her character on the sitcom [[coming out|came out]] of [[the closet]] to her [[therapist]], played by [[Oprah Winfrey]].<ref name="something">{{cite news|author=Caryn James|title=A Message That's Diminished by the Buildup|work=The New York Times|date=April 13, 1997|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5DC173CF930A25757C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 14, 2008}}</ref> The coming-out episode, titled "[[The Puppy Episode]]", was one of the highest-rated episodes of the show. The series returned for a fifth season, but experienced falling [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] due to ABC's cutting back on promoting the show.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was believed that [[The Walt Disney Company]], ABC's parent owner, had become uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted on the show now that DeGeneres' character was openly gay.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In May 1998, ''Ellen'' was canceled. DeGeneres returned to stand-up comedy, and later re-established herself as a successful talk show host.

DeGeneres returned to television in 2001 with a new [[CBS]] sitcom, ''[[The Ellen Show]]''. DeGeneres launched a daytime television talk show, ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]],'' in September 2003. One of several celebrity-hosted talk shows surfacing at the beginning of that season, including those of [[Sharon Osbourne]] and [[Rita Rudner]], her show has consistently risen in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and received widespread critical praise. It was nominated for 11 [[Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy Awards]] in its first season, winning four, including Best Talk Show. The show has won 25 [[Emmy Awards]] for its first three seasons on the air. DeGeneres is known for her dancing and singing with the audience at the beginning of the show and during commercial breaks. She often gives away free prizes and trips to be in her show's studio audience with the help of her sponsors.

DeGeneres celebrated her thirty-year class reunion by flying her graduating class to California to be guests on her show in February 2006. She presented Atlanta High School with a surprise gift of a new electronic [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] marquee sign. In May 2006, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance at the [[Tulane University]] commencement in New Orleans. Following [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. "They told me everyone would be wearing robes," she said. Ellen then went on to make another [[commencement speech]] at Tulane in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8ToRVOtRo|title=Ellen's Commencement Speech at Tulane, 2009|publisher=Youtube.com|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref>

The show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride and the Jaws Boat Ride. In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on [[bed rest]] due to a torn ligament in her back.  She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining "the show must go on, as they say."  Guests sat in hospital beds as well. On May 1, 2009, DeGeneres celebrated her 1000th episode, featuring celebrity guests such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Paris Hilton]], among others. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Award shows==

DeGeneres received wide exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the [[Emmy Award]]s. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the [[September 11 attacks]] would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing ovations for her performance that evening, which included the line: "What would bug the [[Taliban]] more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by [[Jews]]?"

In August 2005, DeGeneres hosted the [[57th Primetime Emmy Awards|2005 Primetime Emmy Awards]] ceremony held on September 18, 2005. This was three weeks after [[Hurricane Katrina]], making it the second time she hosted the Emmys following a national tragedy. She also hosted the [[Grammy Awards]] in 1996 and in 1997.

On September 7, 2006, DeGeneres was selected to host the [[79th Academy Awards]] ceremony, which took place on February 25, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2006/06.09.07.html | title=Ellen DeGeneres to Host 79th Academy Awards Presentation | publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | date=September 7, 2006 | accessdate=September 8, 2006 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060929132634/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2006/06.09.07.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 29, 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> This makes her the first openly gay or lesbian person to have hosted the event.
