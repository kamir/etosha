==Career==

===Early roles===
In Chicago, she joined [[The Second City]] comedy troupe. She appeared in several episodes  of the popular sketch comedy show [[Second City Television|SCTV]] as well. In 1975, she began writing, producing, and co-hosting the television program ''Sorting It Out''. The local [[NBC]] broadcast went on to win three [[Regional Emmys]] for Best Entertainment Show.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Long also appeared in the 1970s in V05 Shampoo print advertisements, Homemakers Furniture, and Camay Soap commercials. In 1978 she guest starred in an episode of ''[[The Love Boat]]''.

Her first notable role came in the 1979 television movie ''[[The Cracker Factory]]'' as a psychiatric inmate; the movie starred [[Natalie Wood]]. That same year she guest starred on ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'' and ''[[Trapper John M.D.]]'' In 1980 she appeared in her first feature film role in ''[[A Small Circle of Friends]]''.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800045492/bio|title=Shelley Long Biography|publisher=Movies.yahoo.com|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref> The film about social unrest at [[Harvard University]] during the 1960s was a critical success.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 1981, she played the role of Tala in ''[[Caveman (film)|Caveman]]''. She played Nurse Mendenhall in a 1980 episode ("Bottle Fatigue") of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''.

In 1982, she starred as Belinda in [[Ron Howard]]'s comedy ''[[Night Shift (film)|Night Shift]]'' (co-starring [[Henry Winkler]] and [[Michael Keaton]]), about life working on the night shift at a city morgue, and starred with [[Tom Cruise]] in ''[[Losin' It]]'' (1983). She was offered the role of Mary, the mother in the classic film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', but she declined because she already signed on to star in ''Night Shift''.

===''Cheers''===
Although she had already been in feature films, Long became famous for her role in the long-running television sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' as the character [[Diane Chambers]], who mainly has an [[Sam and Diane|on-and-off relationship]] with [[Sam Malone]].<ref name="yahoo1"/> The show was slow to capture an audience but eventually became one of the most popular on the air. Amid much controversy, Long left ''Cheers'' after season five in 1987.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1912597_1912596_1912583,00.html|title=Shelley Long – Top 10 Quitters|work=TIME|date=July 24, 2009|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref>

In the ''Cheers'' biography documentary, costar [[Ted Danson]] admitted there was tension between them but "never at a personal level and always at a work level" due to their different modes of working. He also stated that Long was much more like her character than she would like to admit, but also said that her performances often "carried the show."<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://television.aol.com/celebs/shelley-long/1810425/biography|title=Shelley Long Biodata|publisher=Television.aol.com|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rozen|first=Leah|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096257,00.html|title=Ted Danson Leers Again on Cheers – Cheers, Ted Danson|work=People|date=May 11, 1987|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref> Long said in later interviews that it did not occur to her, when deciding to leave,  that she was going to 'sabotage a show' and she felt confident that the rest of the cast could continue without her.<ref>http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KEIfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zWoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6778,5890531&dq=shelley+versus+everyone+cheers&hl=en</ref>

In a 2003 interview on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', Long said she left for a variety of reasons, the most important of which was her desire to spend more time with her newborn daughter. In a 2007 interview on Australian television, Long claimed Danson was "a delight to work with" and talked of her love for costar Nicholas Colasanto who was "one of my closest friends on set." She said she left the show because she "didn't want to keep doing the same episode over and over again and the same story ... I didn't want it to become old and stale." She went on to say that "working at ''Cheers'' was a dream come true ... it was one of the most satisfying experiences of my life. So, yes, I missed it, but I never regretted that decision."<ref>{{cite web|title=Where Are They Now Australian TV Interview|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whbjIkOpT7g}}</ref>

===Film===
While simultaneously appearing on ''Cheers'', she continued starring in several motion pictures. In 1984, she was nominated for a Best Leading Actress [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for her performance in ''[[Irreconcilable Differences]]''. She then starred in a series of comedies, such as ''[[The Money Pit]]'' with [[Tom Hanks]], ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' with [[Bette Midler]] and [[Peter Coyote]] and ''[[Hello Again (film)|Hello Again]]'' with [[Corbin Bernsen]]. She was also offered lead roles in ''[[Working Girl]]'', ''[[Jumpin' Jack Flash (film)|Jumpin' Jack Flash]]'' and ''[[My Stepmother is an Alien]]'', but did not accept those roles.

===Post-''Cheers'' projects===
Her first post-''Cheers'' project was ''[[Troop Beverly Hills]]'', a comedy in which she plays a housewife who takes leadership of a "Wilderness Girl" troop to bond with her daughter and to distract herself from divorce proceedings.

In 1990, Long returned to television for the fact-based [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] miniseries ''[[Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase]]''. She received critical praise for the role,<ref>{{cite news|title=Difficult Multi-Personality Role Played Expertly by Shelley Long|work=The Daily Gazette|date=May 19, 1990 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapersid=SWMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bIkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1094,5106125&dq=shelley+long+truddi+chase&hl=en}}</ref> which required her to portray nearly 20 different personalities. This introduced her to more dramatic roles in TV films, after which she starred in several more throughout the 1990s.

Major feature film roles followed such as the romantic comedy ''[[Don't Tell Her It's Me]]'' with [[Jami Gertz]] and [[Steve Guttenberg]] and ''[[Frozen Assets (film)|Frozen Assets]]'', a comedy about a sperm bank, which reunited her with ''Hello Again'' co-star Corbin Bernsen.

In 1992, she starred in ''Fatal Memories: The Eileen Franklin Story'', a fact-based television drama about a woman who remembers the childhood trauma of being raped by her father and his cronies, and witnessing him murder her childhood friend to prevent the child from "telling on him."<ref>Erickson, Hal [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/125452/Fatal-Memories/overview Fatal Memories (1992) Review] ''The New York Times'', Undated</ref> The still-controversial "[[Memory and trauma|recovered memories]]" basis for the prosecution resulted in the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment of George Franklin, Sr.,<ref>Wadler, Joyce [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20111206,00.html Exhuming the horror / For 20 Years, Eileen Franklin Repressed a Memory of Murder; Now She's Healing—and Her Father Is in Jail] People, November 4, 1991</ref> a conviction that was later overturned.<ref>Workman, Bill [http://articles.sfgate.com/1996-07-03/news/17779592_1_eileen-franklin-douglas-horngrad-george-franklin `Memory' Case Put To Rest – No Retrial / Franklin to go free after almost 7 years] SFGate, July 3, 1996</ref> She also appeared in ''A Message From Holly'' co-starring with [[Lindsay Wagner]], in which she stars as a workaholic who finds out that her best friend has cancer with only six months to live, and then stays with her in her last months.

In 1993, the actress returned to ''Cheers'' for its [[One for the Road (Cheers)|series finale]], and picked up another [[Emmy]] nomination for her return as Diane.<ref>Bird, J.B. [http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=cheers Cheers / U.S. Situation Comedy] The Museum of Broadcast Communications, Undated</ref> She also starred in the sitcom ''[[Good Advice (TV series)|Good Advice]]'' with [[Treat Williams]] and [[Teri Garr]], but the show lasted just two seasons.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106013/ Good Advice (TV Series 1993–1994)] at IMDb</ref> She later resurfaced as Diane for several episodes of the [[Kelsey Grammer]] spinoff series ''[[Frasier]]'', for which she was nominated for another [[Emmy Award]].<ref name="imdb"/>

===Later work===
Long appeared as [[Carol Brady]] in the 1995 hit film ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', a campy take on the popular television show. In 1996, she reprised her role in ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'', which had more modest success.<ref name="imdb"/>

A series of ventures followed such as the [[made-for-television|made for TV]] remake of ''[[Freaky Friday (1995 film)|Freaky Friday]]'', and the family sitcom ''[[Kelly Kelly (TV series)|Kelly Kelly]]'', which only lasted for a few episodes. She played the Wicked Witch of the Beanstalk in a 1997 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

In 1999 she starred in another TV drama film ''Vanished Without a Trace'', about a woman who simply refuses to accept the kidnapping of her 13-year-old daughter and relentlessly pursues the villain's capture.  (Not to be confused with the 1993 film of the same name about the [[1976 Chowchilla kidnapping]].)<ref name="imdb"/> In 2000, Long appeared as one of the women in the [[Richard Gere]] film, ''[[Dr. T and the Women]]'', directed by [[Robert Altman]]. She later returned for a third go-around as Carol Brady in the TV film ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

In recent years, she has guest starred in several TV shows such as ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', ''[[Yes, Dear]]'', ''[[Strong Medicine]]'', and ''[[Boston Legal]]''. She has had a recurring role on the popular ABC sitcom ''[[Modern Family]]'' as DeDe Pritchett, the ex-wife of [[Jay Pritchett]], appearing on the show in 2009, 2011 and 2012.<ref name="imdb"/> In recent years, she has starred in made-for-television movies, including ''[[Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door]]'' and  ''[[Holiday Engagement]]''. In 2012 she made a guest appearance on ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]''.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|1480}}</ref>
