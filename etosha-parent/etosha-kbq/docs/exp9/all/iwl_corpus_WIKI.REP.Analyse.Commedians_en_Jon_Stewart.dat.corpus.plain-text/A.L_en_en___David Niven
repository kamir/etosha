'''James David Graham Niven''' (1 March 1910 – 29 July 1983)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Niven, (James) David Graham (1910–1983), actor and author|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101031503|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=8 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Obituaries|work=[[The Times]]|date=30 July 1983}}</ref> was an English actor and novelist who was popular in Europe and in the United States. He may be best known for his roles as [[Squadron Leader]] Peter Carter in ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'', as [[Phileas Fogg]] in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' and as Sir Charles Lytton, a.k.a. "the Phantom", in ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]].'' He was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958).

Born in London, Niven attended [[Heatherdown Preparatory School]] and [[Stowe School|Stowe]] before gaining a place at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. After Sandhurst he was [[Gazetted Officer (India)|gazetted]] a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Highland Light Infantry]]. Having developed an interest in acting, he left the Highland Light Infantry, travelled to [[Hollywood]] and had several minor roles in film. He first appeared as an extra in the British film ''There Goes the Bride'' (1932). From there, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films from 1933 to 1935, including a non-speaking part in [[MGM]]'s ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. This brought him to wider attention within the film industry and he was spotted by [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being re-commissioned as a lieutenant.

Niven resumed his acting career after his [[demobilisation]], and was voted the second most popular British actor in the 1945 Popularity Poll of British film stars. He appeared in ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'' (1947) and ''[[Enchantment (1948 film)|Enchantment]]'' (1948), all of which received critical acclaim. Niven later appeared in ''[[The Elusive Pimpernel]]'' (1950), ''[[The Toast of New Orleans]]'' (1950), ''[[Happy Go Lovely]]'' (1951), ''[[Happy Ever After (1954 film)|Happy Ever After]]'' (1954) and ''[[Carrington V.C. (film)|Carrington V.C.]]'' (1955) before scoring a big success as Phileas Fogg in [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s production of ''Around the World in 80 Days''. Niven appeared in nearly a hundred films, and many shows for television. He also began writing books, with considerable commercial success. In 1982 he appeared in [[Blake Edwards]]' final "Pink Panther" films ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[Curse of the Pink Panther]]'', reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton.

==Early life==
James David Graham Niven was born in [[Belgrave Square|Belgrave Mansions]], London to William Edward Graham Niven (1878–1915) and his wife, Henrietta Julia (née Degacher) Niven.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morley|first1=Sheridan|title=David Niven, Brief Lives|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198600879|page=413}}</ref> He was named David for his birth on [[Saint David's Day|St. David's Day (1 March)]]. Niven often claimed that he was born in [[Kirriemuir]], in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] county of [[Angus]] in 1909, but his birth certificate shows this was not the case.<ref name="OtherSide">{{Cite book|last=Morley|first=Sheridan|authorlink=Sheridan Morley|title=The Other Side of the Moon|year=1985|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-340-39643-1}}</ref>

Henrietta was of French and British ancestry. She was born in [[Wales]], the daughter of army officer William Degacher (1841–1879) by his marriage to Julia Caroline Smith, the daughter of [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] James Webber Smith. Niven's grandfather William Degacher was killed in the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] (1879), during the [[Zulu War]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lundy |first=Darryl|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p18314.htm#i183134|title= Captain William Degacher|publisher=[http://www.thepeerage.com The Peerage]}} {{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref><ref>''The Times'', "Marriages", 26 October 1888</ref> Born William Hitchcock, he and his brother Henry had followed the lead of their father, Walter Henry Hitchcock, in assuming their mother's maiden name of Degacher in 1874.<ref>''The Times'', 18 February 1874, p. 1</ref>

William Niven, David's father, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent; his paternal grandfather, David Graham Niven, (1811–1884) was from St. Martin's, a village in [[Perthshire]]. William served in the [[Berkshire Yeomanry]] in the First World War and was killed during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] on 21 August 1915. He was buried in [[Green Hill Cemetery]], Turkey in the Special Memorial Section in Plot F. 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=602423|title=Casualty details—Niven, William Edward Graham|publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref>

Niven's mother remarried, to Sir Thomas Comyn-Platt, in London in 1917. [[Graham Lord]], in ''Niv: The Authorised Biography of David Niven'', suggested that Comyn-Platt and Mrs. Niven had been having an affair for some time before her husband's death, and that Sir Thomas may well have been David Niven's biological father, a supposition which has some support from her children. A reviewer of Lord's book stated that Lord's photographic evidence showing a strong physical resemblance between Niven and Comyn-Platt "would appear to confirm these theories, though photographs can often be misleading."<ref name="HM"/>

David Niven had three older siblings:
*Margaret Joyce (born in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], 5 January 1900 – 18 November 1981)<ref name=Peer>{{cite web|last=Lundy|first=Darryl|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p18314.htm|title=Person Page 18314|publisher=Thepeerage.com|accessdate=27 September 2012}} {{Unreliable source?|failed=y|date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>
*Henry Degacher ("Max"; born in [[Buckland, Oxfordshire|Buckland]], [[Berkshire]] (now [[Oxfordshire]]), 29 June 1902 – March 1953)<ref name=Peer/>
*Grizel Rosemary Graham<ref>An artist, she created the [[bronze sculpture]] called the ''Bessie'' that is presented to the [[Orange Prize for Fiction]] winner.</ref> (born in [[Belgravia]], [[Middlesex]], 28 November 1906 – 28 January 2007).<ref name=Peer/>

===Education and army service===
[[File:Stowe School - geograph.org.uk - 582994.jpg|thumb|200px|Stowe School]]
English private schools at the time of Niven's boyhood were noted for their strict and sometimes brutal discipline. Niven suffered many instances of [[corporal punishment]] owing to his inclination for pranks, which finally led to his expulsion from [[Heatherdown Preparatory School]] at the age of 10½. This ended his chances for [[Eton College]], a significant blow to his family. After failing to pass the naval entrance exam because of his difficulty with maths, Niven attended [[Stowe School]], a newly created public school led by headmaster J.F. Roxburgh, who was unlike any of Niven's previous headmasters. Thoughtful and kind, he addressed the boys by their first name, allowed them bicycles and encouraged and nurtured their personal interests. Niven later wrote, "How he did this, I shall never know, but he made every single boy at that school feel that what he said and what he did were of real importance to the headmaster".<ref name="Moon">{{Cite book|author=David Niven|title=The Moon's a Balloon|year=1971|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|isbn=0-340-15817-4}}</ref> He attended the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military College at Sandhurst]], graduating in 1930 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the [[British Army|regular Army]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33575|supp=yes|startpage=651|endpage=652|date=31 January 1930|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref>

He did well at Sandhurst, which gave him the "officer and gentleman" bearing that was to be his trademark. He requested assignment to the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] or the [[Black Watch]], then jokingly wrote on the form, as his third choice, "anything but the Highland Light Infantry" (because the HLI wore tartan trews rather than kilts). He was assigned to the HLI, and his comment was known in the regiment. Thus Niven did not enjoy his time in the army. He served with the HLI for two years in [[Malta]] and then for a few months in [[Dover]]. In Malta he became friends with [[Roy Urquhart]], future commander of the [[British 1st Airborne Division]].<ref name="Moon"/>

Niven grew tired of the peacetime army. Though promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1933,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33907|startpage=674|date=31 January 1933|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref> he saw no opportunity for further advancement. His ultimate decision to resign came after a lengthy lecture on [[machine gun]]s, which was interfering with his plans for dinner with a particularly attractive young lady. At the end of the lecture, the speaker (a major general) asked if there were any questions. Showing the typical rebelliousness of his early years, Niven asked, "Could you tell me the time, sir? I have to catch a train".<ref name="Moon"/>

After being placed under close-arrest for this act of insubordination, Niven finished a bottle of [[whisky]] with the officer who was guarding him: Rhoddy Rose (later Colonel R.L.C. Rose, DSO, MC). With Rose's assistance, Niven was allowed to escape from a first-floor window. He then headed for America. While crossing the Atlantic, Niven resigned his commission by [[telegram]] on 6 September 1933.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33975|startpage=5801|date=5 September 1933|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref> Niven then moved to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful career in whisky sales, after which he had a stint in horse [[rodeo]] promotion in [[Atlantic City]]. After detours to [[Bermuda]] and [[Cuba]], he arrived in [[Hollywood]] in 1934.

==Early film career==
When Niven presented himself at [[Central Casting]], he learned that he needed a work permit to reside and work in the U.S. This meant that Niven had to leave the US, so he went to [[Mexico]], where he worked as a "gun-man", cleaning and polishing the rifles of visiting American hunters. He received his [[Permanent residence (United States)|Resident Alien Visa]] from the American consulate when his birth certificate arrived from England. He returned to the United States and was accepted by Central Casting as "Anglo-Saxon Type No. 2008".

His role in ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' brought him to the attention of independent film producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who signed him to a contract and established his career. Niven appeared in 19 films in the next four years. He had supporting roles in several major films—''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose-Marie]]'' (1936), ''Dodsworth'' (1936), ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936),  ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1937)—and leading roles in ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'' (1938), ''Three Blind Mice'' (1938)  and ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' (1939), playing opposite such stars as [[Errol Flynn]], [[Loretta Young]] and [[Laurence Olivier]]. In 1939 he co-starred with [[Ginger Rogers]] in the [[RKO]] comedy ''[[Bachelor Mother]]'', and starred as the eponymous gentleman safe-cracker in ''[[Raffles (1939 film)|Raffles]]''.

Niven joined what became known as the Hollywood Raj, a group of British actors in Hollywood which included [[Rex Harrison]], [[Boris Karloff]], [[Stan Laurel]], [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]<ref>Eforgan, E. (2010) ''Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor''. London: Vallentine Mitchell; p. 94 ISBN 978-0-85303-971-6</ref> and [[C. Aubrey Smith]]. According to his autobiography, he and Errol Flynn were firm friends and had decided to rent [[Rosalind Russell]]'s house at 601 North Linden Drive as a bachelor pad. Russell later named the house "Cirrhosis-by-the-Sea".<ref name="OtherSide"/>

===Second World War===
After Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Niven returned home and rejoined the Army. He was alone among British stars in Hollywood in doing so; the [[British Embassy, Washington, D.C.|British Embassy]] advised most actors to stay.<ref name=friedrich1986>{{cite book|last=Friedrich|first=Otto|title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-20949-4|page=28|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0x8AFchW4JsC&lpg=PP1&dq=city%20of%20nets&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Niven was re-commissioned as a lieutenant in the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]] on 25 February 1940,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34823|supp=yes|startpage=1978|date=5 September 1933|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref> and was assigned to a motor training battalion. He wanted something more exciting however, and transferred into the [[British Commandos|Commandos]]. He was assigned to a training base at [[Inverailort House]] in the Western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. Niven later claimed credit for bringing future Major General Sir [[Robert Laycock]] to the Commandos. Niven commanded "A" Squadron [[GHQ Liaison Regiment]], better known as "Phantom". He worked with the Army Film Unit. He acted in two films made during the war, ''[[The First of the Few]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944). Both were made with a view to winning support for the British war effort, especially in the U.S. Niven's Film Unit work included a small part in the deception operation that used minor actor [[M.E. Clifton James]] to impersonate [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery]]. During his work with the Film Unit, [[Peter Ustinov]], though one of the script-writers, had to pose as Niven's [[Batman (army)|batman]]. (Ustinov also acted in ''The Way Ahead''.) Niven explained in his autobiography that there was no military way that he, as a [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]], and Ustinov, who was only a [[private (rank)|private]], could associate, other than as an officer and his subordinate, hence their strange "act". Ustinov later appeared with Niven in ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978).

Niven took part in the [[Invasion of Normandy]], although he was sent to France several days after [[D-Day]]. He served in the "[[GHQ Liaison Regiment|Phantom Signals Unit]]", which located and reported enemy positions, and kept rear commanders informed on changing battle lines. Niven was posted at one time to [[Chilham]] in [[Kent]]. He remained close-mouthed about the war, despite public interest in celebrities in combat and a reputation for storytelling. He once said:<blockquote>I will, however, tell you just one thing about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near [[Bastogne]]. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war. </blockquote>

He had particular scorn for those newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, "Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard one—they go ''crack''!" He gave a few details of his war experience in his autobiography, ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'': his private conversations with [[Winston Churchill]], the bombing of London, and what it was like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, "Young man, you did a fine thing to give up your film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so − it would have been despicable."<ref name="Moon"/>

A few stories have surfaced. About to lead his men into action, Niven eased their nervousness by telling them, "Look, you chaps only have to do this once. But I'll have to do it all over again in Hollywood with [[Errol Flynn]]!" Asked by suspicious American sentries during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] who had won the [[1943 World Series|World Series in 1943]], he answered "Haven't the foggiest idea&nbsp;... but I did co-star with [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''[[Bachelor Mother]]''!" {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} On another occasion, asked how he felt about serving with the British army in Europe, he allegedly said 'Well on the whole, I would rather be tickling Ginger Rogers' tits'.

Niven ended the war as a [[lieutenant-colonel]]. On his return to Hollywood after the war, he received the [[Legion of Merit]], an American military decoration. Presented by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] himself, it honoured Niven's work in setting up the [[BBC Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme]], a radio news and entertainment station for the Allied forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7698398|title=Recommendation for Award for Niven, John David Rank: Lieutenant Colonel|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37340|supp=yes|startpage=5461|date=6 November 1945|accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref>

==Postwar career==
[[File:David Niven in Enchantment (1948).jpg|thumb|Niven in the 1948 film ''[[Enchantment (1948 film)|Enchantment]]'']]
Niven resumed his career in 1946, now only in starring roles. His films ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'' (1947) with [[Cary Grant]], and ''[[Enchantment (1948 film)|Enchantment]]'' (1948) are all highly regarded. In 1950 he starred in ''[[The Elusive Pimpernel]]'', which was made in Britain and which was to be distributed by Samuel Goldwyn. Goldwyn pulled out, and the film did not appear in the US for three years. Niven had a long, complex relationship with Goldwyn, who gave him his first start. But the dispute over ''The Elusive Pimpernel'' and Niven's demands for more money led to a long estrangement between the two in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51974399|title=David Niven's Own Story|newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=15 September 1971|accessdate=7 July 2012|page=15|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

During this period Niven was largely barred from the Hollywood studios. Between 1951 and 1956 he made 11 films, two of which were MGM productions and the rest were low-budget British or independent productions. However, Niven won a [[Golden Globe]] Award for his work in ''[[The Moon Is Blue]]'' (1953), produced and directed by [[Otto Preminger]]. In 1955 [[Cornel Lucas]] photographed Niven while filming at the [[Rank Organisation|Rank]] Film Studio in [[Denham, Buckinghamshire]].<ref>These images can be seen at the [http://www.cornellucascollection.com Cornel Lucas Collection website].</ref> A limited edition of British postage stamps was produced using one of Lucas's images taken during this portrait sitting. Niven worked in television. He appeared several times on various short-drama shows, and was one of the "four stars" of the dramatic [[anthology series]] ''Four Star Playhouse'', appearing in 33 episodes. The show was produced by [[Four Star Television]], which was co-owned and founded by Niven, [[Dick Powell]] and [[Charles Boyer]]. The show ended in 1955, but Four Star TV became a highly successful TV production company. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[File:David Niven in The Toast of New Orleans trailer cropped.jpg|right|thumb|from the trailer for ''[[The Toast of New Orleans]]'' (1950)]]
Niven enjoyed success in 1956, when he starred as Phileas Fogg in producer [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s ''Around the World in 80 Days''. He won the 1958 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as Major Pollock in ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'', his only nomination for an Oscar. Appearing on-screen for only 16 minutes in the film, this remains the briefest performance ever to win a Best Actor Oscar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscarmovs.com/septab.html|title=Separate Tables (1958)|publisher=Oscarmovs.com|accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref> He was also a co-host of the 30th, 31st and 46th Academy Awards ceremonies. After Niven had won the Academy Award, Goldwyn called with an invitation to his home. In Goldwyn's drawing room, Niven noticed a picture of himself in uniform which he had sent to Goldwyn from Britain during the Second World War. In happier times with Goldwyn, he had observed this same picture sitting on Goldwyn's piano. Now years later, the picture was still in exactly the same spot. As he was looking at the picture, Goldwyn's wife Frances said "Sam never took it down."<ref name="Moon"/>

With an Academy Award to his credit, Niven's career continued to thrive. In 1959 he became the host of his own TV drama series, ''[[The David Niven Show]]'', which ran for 13 episodes that summer. He subsequently appeared in another thirty films, including ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961) ''The Pink Panther'' (1963), ''[[Murder by Death]]'' (1976), ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978) and ''The Sea Wolves'' (1980).

[[File:The Rogues cast 1964.JPG|thumb|left|175px|''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' (1964)]]
In 1964 he and Boyer appeared in the Four Star series ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]''. Niven played Alexander 'Alec' Fleming, one of a family of retired con-artists who now fleece villains in the interests of justice. This was his only recurring role on television. ''The Rogues'' ran for only one season, but won a Golden Globe award. In 1965 he starred in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059905/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_27 ''Where the Spies Are''.] In 1967 he appeared as James Bond 007 in ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Niven had been Bond creator [[Ian Fleming]]'s first choice to play Bond in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. ''Casino Royale'' co-producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] said later that Fleming had written the book with Niven in mind, and therefore had sent a copy to Niven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmss.com/books/fleming|title=Ian Fleming, Author or Spy?|accessdate=24 August 2007}}</ref> Niven was the only James Bond actor mentioned by name in the text of Fleming's novels. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', Bond visits an exclusive ski resort in Switzerland where he is told that David Niven is a frequent visitor and in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', Niven is referred to as the only real gentleman in Hollywood. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

While Niven was co-hosting the [[46th Academy Awards|46th Annual Oscars ceremony]], [[Robert Opel|a naked man]] appeared behind him, [[Streaking|"streaking" across the stage]]. Niven responded "Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IIl3zSYL8k|title=Oscar streaker|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref>

In 1974 he hosted ''David Niven's World'' for [[London Weekend Television]], which profiled contemporary adventurers such as hang gliders, motorcyclists and mountain climbers: it ran for 21 episodes. In 1975 he narrated ''The Remarkable Rocket'', a short animation based on a story by [[Oscar Wilde]]. In 1979 he appeared in ''[[Escape to Athena]]'', which was produced by his son David, Jr. In July 1982, [[Blake Edwards]] brought Niven back for cameo appearances in two final "Pink Panther" films (''Trail of the Pink Panther'' and ''Curse of the Pink Panther''), reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton. By this time, Niven was having serious health problems. When the raw footage was reviewed, his voice was inaudible, and his lines had to be dubbed by [[Rich Little]]. Niven only learned of it from a newspaper report. This was his last film appearance. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Writing===
Niven wrote four books. The first, ''Round the Rugged Rocks'', (published simultaneously in the US under the title "Once Over Lightly") was a novel that appeared in 1951 and was forgotten almost at once. In 1971 he published his autobiography, ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'', which was well received, selling over five million copies. He followed this with ''Bring On the Empty Horses'' in 1975, a collection of entertaining reminiscences from Hollywood's "Golden Age" in the 1930s and 40s. It now appears that Niven recounted many incidents from a first-person perspective that actually happened to other people, especially [[Cary Grant]], which he borrowed and embroidered.<ref name="OtherSide"/> In 1981 Niven published a second and much more successful novel, ''Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly'', which was set during and after the Second World War, and which drew on his experiences during the war and in Hollywood. He was working on a third novel at the time of his death.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Personal life==
After a whirlwind two-week romance in 1940, Niven married Primula Susan Rollo (18 February 1918, London – 21 May 1946), the aristocratic daughter of British barrister William Hereward Charles Rollo, who was a grandson of the 10th [[Lord Rollo]], and Lady Kathleen Nina Hill, daughter of the 6th [[Marquess of Downshire]]. The couple had two sons: [[David Niven, Jr.|David, Jr.]] and Jamie. Primula, whom he called Primmie, died at age 28, only six weeks after moving to the U.S., of a fractured skull and brain lacerations from an accidental fall in the [[Beverly Hills, California]] home of [[Tyrone Power]]. While playing "[[Hide-and-seek|sardines]]", she walked through a door believing it led to a closet. Instead, it led to a stone staircase to the basement.

Niven recalled this as the darkest period of his life, years afterwards thanking his friends for their patience and forbearance during this time. He claimed to have been so grief-stricken that he thought for a while that he had gone mad. Following a suicide attempt involving a handgun which failed to fire, he eventually rallied and returned to filmmaking.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dunk|first=Marcus|title=The Day David Niven Put a Gun to His Head – and Pulled the Trigger|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1183911/The-day-David-Niven-gun-head--pulled-trigger.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=29 May 2009|location=London}}</ref>

In 1948 Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a divorced [[Sweden|Swedish]] fashion model. He recounted their meeting:<blockquote>I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes I had ever seen. It really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady novelists&nbsp;... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.<ref name="Moon"/></blockquote>

They married six weeks later. However, Niven's second marriage was as tumultuous as his first marriage was content. In an unsuccessful effort to bring harmony to the marriage, he and his wife adopted two girls, Kristina and Fiona. Kristina later told biographer Graham Lord that she was convinced that she was Niven's secret child by another fashion model, Mona Gunnarson. All four of Niven's children, as well as many of his friends, told Lord that Hjördis, unable to achieve an acting career, had affairs with other men and became an alcoholic. In October 1951, while pheasant shooting with friends in [[New England]], Hjördis was shot in the face, neck and chest by a member of the hunting party. Local doctors wished to operate immediately to remove the birdshot. However, another doctor advised Niven to allow the swelling of the face to go down. In this way, his wife avoided disfigurement. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

While she was convalescing in the Blackstone Hotel in [[New York City|New York]], Niven and Hjördis were next-door neighbours with [[Audrey Hepburn]], who made her début on Broadway that season. In 1960, while filming ''[[Please Don't Eat the Daisies (film)|Please Don't Eat the Daisies]]'' with [[Doris Day]], Niven and Hjördis separated for a few weeks, but later reconciled. Hjördis stopped drinking alcohol for a time after Niven's death in 1983, but returned to it before her own death of a stroke in 1997 at age 78.<ref name="Niv 2004, p. 425">''Niv: The Authorised Biography of David Niven'' by Graham Lord, Orion, 2004, p. 425</ref> Niven's friend Billie More noted: "This is not kind, but when Hjördis died I can't think of a single soul who was sorry".<ref name="Niv 2004, p. 425"/>

Throughout the 1970s, Niven spent much of his time at his home in Chateau d'Oex in Switzerland, near the ski resort of [[Gstaad]]. He had a close group of friends there including actor [[Roger Moore]], writer [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and former US Ambassador to France [[Evan G. Galbraith]].

==Illness and death==
In 1980, Niven began experiencing fatigue, muscle weakness and a warble in his voice. His 1981 interviews on the talk shows of [[Michael Parkinson]] and [[The Merv Griffin Show|Merv Griffin]] alarmed family and friends; viewers wondered if Niven had either been drinking or suffered a stroke. He blamed his slightly slurred voice on the shooting schedule on the film he had been making, ''[[Better Late Than Never (film)|Better Late Than Never]]''. He was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS, or "Lou Gehrig's disease" in the US and Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in the UK) later that year. His final appearance in Hollywood was hosting the 1981 [[American Film Institute]] tribute to [[Fred Astaire]].

In February 1983, using a false name to avoid publicity, Niven was hospitalised for ten days, ostensibly for a digestive problem. Afterwards, he returned to his chalet at [[Château-d'Œx|Chateau d'Oex]]. His condition continued to decline, but he refused to return to the hospital, and his family supported his decision. He died at his chalet at Chateau d'Oex from ALS on 29 July 1983 at age 73, the same day as his ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' co-star [[Raymond Massey]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Donnelley|first=Paul |title=Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|publisher=Music Sales Group|date=2003|pages=522|isbn=0-711-99512-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=David Niven Dead at 73; Witty Actor Won Oscar|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/obituaries/david-niven-dead-at-73-witty-actor-won-oscar.html?pagewanted=1|website=nytimes.com|date=30 July 1983|page=1}}</ref> He was survived by his four children and his second wife.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=David Niven Dead at 73; Witty Actor Won Oscar|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/obituaries/david-niven-dead-at-73-witty-actor-won-oscar.html?pagewanted=2|website=nytimes.com|date=30 July 1983|page=2}}</ref> Niven is buried in Chateau D'Oex Cemetery in Chateau d'Oex, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Patricia|last2=Brooks|first2=Jonathan|title=Laid to Rest in California: A Guide to the Cemeteries and Grave Sites of the Rich and Famous|publisher=Globe Pequot|date=2006|pages=522|isbn=0-762-74101-5}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A Thanksgiving service for Niven was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London, on 27 October 1983. The congregation of 1,200 included [[Prince Michael of Kent]], [[Margaret, Duchess of Argyll]], Sir [[John Mills]], Sir [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Trevor Howard]], Sir [[David Frost]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] and [[Laurence Olivier|Lord Olivier]].<ref>''Niv'' by Graham Lord, Orion, 2004, p. 420</ref>

Biographer Graham Lord wrote that "the biggest wreath, worthy of a Mafia Godfather's funeral, was delivered from the porters at [[London Heathrow Airport|London's Heathrow Airport]], along with a card that read: 'To the finest gentleman who ever walked through these halls. He made a porter feel like a king'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paulburgin.blogspot.com/2006/01/in-thespian-praise-of-david-niven.html|title=In Thespian Praise of: David Niven|publisher=Paulburgin.blogspot.com|date=25 January 2006|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref>

In 1985 Niven was included in a series of British [[postage stamp]]s, along with Sir [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Sir [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Vivien Leigh]], to commemorate "British Film Year".<ref>[[Alexander Walker (critic)|Walker, Alexander]].

==Quotations==
By Niven:
*"It really is amazing. Can you imagine being wonderfully overpaid for dressing up and playing games? It's like being [[Peter Pan]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jerry M. Belsh, M.D.|url=http://www2.umdnj.edu/nmalsweb/archive/notable98.html|title=Notable People with ALS – David Niven|publisher=.umdnj.edu|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref>

*"I've been lucky enough to win an Oscar, write a best-seller—my other dream would be to have a painting in the [[Louvre]]. The only way that's going to happen is if I paint a dirty one on the wall of the gentlemen's lavatory".<ref>{{IMDb name|0000057}}</ref>

*When asked why he seemed so incredibly cheerful all the time: "Well, old bean, life is really so bloody awful that I feel it's my absolute duty to be chirpy and try and make everybody else happy too".<ref name="HM"/>

*Deadpanning after a streaker ran across stage during an Academy Award telecast: "Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was almost bound to happen. But isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20035559-10391698.html|title=CBS Strange Oscar Moments|work=CBS News|date=24 February 2011}}</ref>
