The paper's print version has the largest circulation of any metropolitan newspaper in the United States, and the [[List of newspapers in the United States by circulation|second-largest circulation]] overall, behind ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. It is ranked [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|39th in the world by circulation]].

The paper's motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page. Since the mid-1970s, it has greatly expanded its lay-out and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports and features. Recently it has been organized into sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports of The Times, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, and other features. On Sunday, it is supplemented by sections of The Week in Review, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and recently ''[[T: The New York Times Style Magazine]]''. ''The New York Times'' stayed with the [[broadsheet]] full page set-up (as some others have changed into a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] lay-out) and an eight-column format for several years after most papers switched to six, and was one of the last newspapers to adopt [[color photography]], especially on the front page.

==History==
[[File:First NYTimes frontpage (1851-9-18).png|thumb|upright|First published issue of ''New-York Daily Times'', on September 18, 1851.]]
''The New York Times'' was founded as the ''New-York Daily Times'' on September 18, 1851, by journalist and politician [[Henry Jarvis Raymond]], (1820–1869), then a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] member and later second chairman of the newly organized [[Republican National Committee|Republican Party National Committee]], and former banker [[George Jones (publisher)|George Jones]]. Sold for a penny (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|1|1851|fmt=c}}¢ today), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:<ref>{{cite news |title=A Word about Ourselves | work =New-York Daily Times |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser/1851/09/18/109920974/article-view |date=September 18, 1851 |accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref>

We do not believe that ''everything'' in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong;—what is good we desire to preserve and improve;—what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.}}

The newspaper shortened its name to ''The New-York Times'' in 1857. It dropped the hyphen in the city name in the 1890s.<ref>[http://blog.nyhistory.org/it-can-hyphen-here-why-the-new-york-historical-society-includes-a-hyphen/ It Can Hyphen Here: Why the New-York Historical Society Includes a Hyphen » New-York Historical Society]. Blog.nyhistory.org (February 13, 2013). Retrieved on July 21, 2013.</ref>  On April 21, 1861, ''The New York Times'' departed from its original Monday–Saturday publishing schedule and joined other major dailies in adding a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. One of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the [[Mortara Affair]], the subject of twenty editorials it published alone.<ref>Cornwell, 2004, p. 151.</ref>

The main office of  ''The New York Times'' was attacked during the [[New York Draft Riots]] sparked by the beginning of military conscription for the Northern [[Union Army]] now instituted in the midst of the Civil War on July 13, 1863. At "Newspaper Row", across from [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], [[Henry Raymond]], owner and editor of ''The New York Times'', averted the rioters with "[[Gatling]]" (early machine, rapid-firing) guns, one of which he manned himself.  The mob now diverted, instead attacked the headquarters of abolitionist publisher [[Horace Greeley|Horace Greeley's]] ''[[New York Tribune]]'' until forced to flee by the [[History of the New York City Police Department|Brooklyn City Police]], who had crossed the [[East River (New York)|East River]] to help the Manhattan authorities.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0801.html].</ref>

The newspaper's influence grew during 1870-71 when it published a series of exposés on [[William Magear Tweed|William Magear ("Boss") Tweed]], leader of the city's Democratic Party—popularly known as "[[Tammany Hall]]" (from its early 19th Century meeting headquarters) — that led to the end of the "Tweed Ring's" domination of New York's City Hall.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 15, 2008|url=http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1851.html|title= New York Times Timeline 1851–1880 |publisher=The New York Times Company}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> In the 1880s, ''The New York Times'' transitioned gradually from editorially supporting [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates to becoming more politically independent and analytical; in 1884, the paper supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Grover Cleveland]] (former Mayor of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Governor of New York State]]) in his [[United States presidential election, 1884|first presidential campaign]]. While this move cost ''The New York Times''{{'}} readership among its more conservative, business-oriented, upper-class readers, the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years and slowly acquired a reputation for even-handedness and accurate modern reporting, especially by the 1890s under its new later owner/publisher's philosophies, [[Adolph Ochs]] of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].<ref name=nyt1881>{{cite web|accessdate=January 22, 2014|url=http://www.nytco.com/who-we-are/culture/our-history/#1910-1881-timeline|title= New York Times Timeline 1881–1910 |publisher=The New York Times Company }}</ref>
''The New York Times'' was acquired by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the ''[[Chattanooga Times]]'', in 1896. The following year, he coined the paper's slogan, "All The News That's Fit To Print", which has since been printed in a box in the upper right hand corner of the front page;<ref name=nyt1881 /> this was a jab at competing papers such as [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''[[New York World]]'' and [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Journal]]'' which were now being known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions known by the end of the century as  "[[yellow journalism]]". Under Ochs guidance, continuing and expanding upon the Henry Raymond tradition, (which were from the era of [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]] of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' which predated Pulitzer and Hearst's arrival in New York), ''The New York Times'' achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation. In 1904, ''The New York Times'' received the first on-the-spot [[wireless]] [[telegraph]] transmission from a naval battle, a report of the destruction of the [[Russian Navy|Imperial Russian Navy]]'s [[Baltic Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in the [[Straits of Tsushima]] off the eastern coast of [[Korea]] in the [[Yellow Sea]] in the western [[Pacific Ocean]] after just sailing across the globe from [[Europe]] from the press-boat ''[[Haimun]]'' during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (one of the most important and history-changing naval battles in history). In 1910, the first air delivery of ''The New York Times'' to [[Philadelphia]] began.<ref name=nyt1881 /> ''The New York Times''{{'}} first trans-Atlantic delivery by air to London occurred in 1919 by dirigible. In 1920, a "4 A.M. Airplane Edition" was sent by plane to Chicago so it could be in the hands of Republican convention delegates by evening.<ref name=nyt1911>{{cite web|accessdate=September 16, 2008|url=http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1911.html|title= New York Times Timeline 1911–1940 |publisher= The New York Times Company}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref>

In the 1940s, the paper extended its breadth and reach. The [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|crossword]] began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section in 1946. ''The New York Times'' began an international edition in 1946. The international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when ''The New York Times'' joined the owners of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' to publish the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' in Paris.

Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page "Bay Area" insert was added to copies of the [[Northern California]] edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.

Because of its steadily declining sales attributed to the rise of online [[alternative media]] and [[social media]], the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses,<ref name="TimesCuts500">{{cite web |url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2005/09/new_york_times_fires_500_staffers/ |title=New York Times Fires 500 Staffers |first=James |last=Joyner |publisher=Outside the Beltway |accessdate=July 4, 2006}}</ref> in common with a general trend among print news media.

===Headquarters building===
The newspaper's first building was located at 113 [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858, it moved to [[41 Park Row]], making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.<ref>{{cite news | author = Dunlap, David W. | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-six-buildings-that-share-one-story.html | title = 150th Anniversary: 1851–2001; Six Buildings That Share One Story | work = The New York Times | date = November 14, 2001 | accessdate = October 10, 2008 | quote = Surely the most remarkable of these survivors is 113 Nassau Street, where the New-York Daily Times was born in 1851.... After three years at 113 Nassau Street and four years at 138 Nassau Street, The New York Times moved to a five-story Romanesque headquarters at 41 Park Row, designed by Thomas R. Jackson. For the first time, a New York newspaper occupied a structure built for its own use.}}</ref>

The paper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904, in an area called Longacre Square, that was later renamed [[Times Square]] in honor of the newspaper. The top of the building{{spaced ndash}} now known as [[One Times Square]]{{spaced ndash}} is the site of the [[New Year's Eve]] tradition of lowering a [[Times Square Ball|lighted ball]], that was started by the paper. The building is also notable for its electronic [[news ticker]]{{spaced ndash}} popularly known as "The Zipper"{{spaced ndash}} where headlines crawled around the outside of the building. It is still in use, but is now operated by the [[Reuters]] news agency. After nine years in its Times Square tower, the newspaper had an Annex built at 229 West 43rd Street. After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year. It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the [[College Point, Queens|College Point]] section of the borough of [[Queens]].

A decade later, The ''New York Times'' moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a gleaming new tower at 620 [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] between West 40th and 41st Streets, in [[Manhattan]]{{spaced ndash}} directly across Eighth Avenue from the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as [[The New York Times Building]] but unofficially called the new "Times Tower" by many New Yorkers, is a [[skyscraper]] designed by [[Renzo Piano]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 25, 2008|url=http://www.nytco.com/pdf/Building_Timeline.pdf|format=pdf|title=Timeline of The New York Times Building| publisher =The New York Times Company}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref name="Headquarters">{{cite web | title =New York Times Headquarters | publisher = SkyscraperPage.com | year = 2007 | url =http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=916 | accessdate = September 16, 2008 }}</ref>

===''New York Times v. Sullivan''===
{{Main|New York Times Co. v. Sullivan}}
The paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions supporting [[freedom of the press]], ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]''. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the "[[actual malice]]" standard for press reports about public officials or [[public figure]]s to be considered [[defamation|defamatory]] or [[libel]]ous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in [[Recklessness (law)|reckless disregard]] of its truth or falsity. Because of the high [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving what is inside a person's head, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=New York Times Co. v. Sullivan|vol=376|reporter=U.S.|opinion=254|court=Supreme Court of the United States|year=1964|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=376&page=254}}</ref>

===The Pentagon Papers===
{{Main|Pentagon Papers}}
In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, a secret [[United States Department of Defense]] history of the United States' political and military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to [[Neil Sheehan]] of ''The New York Times'' by former [[State Department]] official [[Daniel Ellsberg]], with his friend [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]] assisting in copying them. ''The New York Times'' began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over [[Laos]], raids along the coast of [[North Vietnam]], and offensive actions taken by [[U.S. Marines]] well before the public was told about the actions, all while President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the [[credibility gap]] for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the [[Nixon administration]] to fight the ongoing war.<ref name=nytpentagon>{{cite news|accessdate= September 18, 2008|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pentagon_papers/index.html|title=Pentagon Papers |work=The New York Times | first=Noam | last=Cohen}}</ref>

When ''The New York Times'' began publishing its series, President [[Richard Nixon]] became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] included "People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing..." and "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html |title=Audio Tapes from the Nixon White House |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |quote= |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] }}</ref> After failing to get ''The New York Times'' to stop publishing, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that ''The New York Times'' cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, ''The Washington Post'' began publishing its own series. [[Ben Bagdikian]], a ''Post'' editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the ''Post'' received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, [[William Rehnquist]], asking them to stop publishing. When the ''Post'' refused, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] sought another injunction. The [[United States district court|U.S. District court]] judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971 the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] enshrines an absolute [[freedom of speech|right to free speech]], many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of [[national security]] were at stake.<ref name=nytpentagon/>

===Discrimination in employment===
[[Employment discrimination|Discriminatory]] practices restricting women in editorial positions were part of the history, correlating with effects on the journalism published at the time. The newspaper's first general woman reporter was [[Jane Grant]], who described her experience afterwards. She wrote, "In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable [[hazing]]. Because of her [[sex and gender distinction|gender]], promotions were out of the question, according to the then-managing editor.

==Ownership==
[[File:Nytimes hq.jpg|thumb|right|''The New York Times'' headquarters 620 Eighth Avenue]]
In 1896,  Adolph Ochs bought the ''New York Times'', a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States{{'}} newspaper dynasties, has owned ''The New York Times'' ever since.<ref name=nyt1881 /> After the publisher [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the 1960s, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B [[Voting interest|voting shares]]. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.

The Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The Trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr. and Cathy J. Sulzberger.<ref>{{cite news|title=How a Money Manager Battled New York Times|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 21, 2007|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117441975619343135-nb3xaCqDA7AjGYGGjWb0pkAVzt8_20080320.html |accessdate=September 16, 2008 | first=Sarah | last=Ellison}}</ref>

[[Turner Catledge]], the top editor at ''The New York Times'' from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.<ref>Chomsky, Daniel(2006) {{"'}}An Interested Reader': Measuring Ownership Control at the New York Times", ''Critical Studies in Media Communication'', 23(1): 1–18</ref>

===Carlos Slim loan and investment===
On January 20, 2009, the ''New York Times'' reported that [[Carlos Slim Helú|Carlos Slim]], Mexican telecommunications magnate and the world's second richest person,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/top-10-wealthiest-people-in-the-world-2014-edition.html/?a=viewall|work=The Cheat Sheet|last=Coyle|first=Emily|title=Top 10 Wealthiest People in the World: 2014 Edition|date=March 8, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150312013223/http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/top-10-wealthiest-people-in-the-world-2014-edition.html/?a=viewall|archivedate=March 12, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref> loaned it $250 million "to help the newspaper company finance its businesses".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mexican Billionaire Invests in Times Company|work=The New York Times|date=January 19, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/business/media/20times.html |accessdate=July 1, 2012 | first=Eric | last=Dash}}</ref> Since then, Slim has made additional investments in ''Times'' stock;

===Dual-class shares===
Dual-class structures caught on in the mid-20th century as families such as the Grahams of [[The Washington Post Company]] sought to gain access to public capital without losing control. [[Dow Jones & Co.]], publisher of ''The Wall Street Journal'', had a similar structure and was controlled by the Bancroft family but was later bought by [[News Corporation]] in 2007, which itself is controlled by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and [[Murdoch family|his family]] through a similar dual-class structure.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=September 18, 2008|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20032918/|title=Murdoch clinches deal for publisher of Journal |publisher=msnbc}}</ref>

==Content==

===Sections===
The newspaper is organized in three sections, including the magazine.
# News: Includes International, National, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Business, Technology, Science, Health, Sports, The [[New York metropolitan area|Metro]] Section, Education, Weather, and Obituaries.
# Opinion: Includes [[Editorial]]s, [[Op-Ed]]s and [[Letter to the editor|Letters to the Editor]].
# Features: Includes Arts, Movies, Theater, Travel, NYC Guide, Dining & Wine, Home & Garden, Fashion & Style, Crossword, ''The New York Times Book Review'', '' [[T: The New York Times Style Magazine]]'', ''The New York Times Magazine'', and Sunday Review.

Some sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut [[Tri-State Area]] and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of [[editorial cartoons]] from other newspapers, ''The New York Times'' does not have its own staff [[editorial cartoonist]], nor does it feature a [[comics page]] or Sunday [[comics]] section. In September 2008, ''The New York Times'' announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by ''The New York Times'' allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow ''The New York Times'' to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. ''The New York Times''{{'}} announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.<ref name="Pérez-Peña, Richard">{{cite news|accessdate=September 16, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/business/media/06times.html|title=Times Plans to Combine Sections of the Paper |work=The New York Times|date=September 5, 2008|author=Pérez-Peña, Richard}}</ref> According to Russ Stanton, editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', a competitor, the newsroom of ''The New York Times'' is twice the size of the ''Los Angeles Times'', which currently has a newsroom of 600.<ref name="Friedman">{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Jon|title=Can Russ Stanton turn around the L.A.

When referring to people, ''The New York Times'' generally uses [[honorific]]s, rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, Book Review and Magazine).

Joining a roster of other major American newspapers in the last ten years, including ''USA Today'', ''The Wall Street Journal'' and ''The Washington Post'', ''The New York Times'' announced on July 18, 2006, that it would be narrowing the width of its paper by six inches. In an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses for most print versions of American newspapers, the move, which would result in a 5 percent reduction in news coverage, would have a target savings of $12 million a year for the paper.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/media/18web.html |title=Times to Reduce Page Size and Close a Plant in 2008 |work=The New York Times |author= Seelye, Katharine Q. |date=July 18, 2006 |accessdate=September 15, 2008}}</ref> The change from the traditional {{convert|54|in|m}} broadsheet style to a more compact 48-inch web width (12-inch page width) was addressed by both Executive Editor Bill Keller and ''The New York Times'' President Scott Heekin-Canedy in memos to the staff. Keller defended the "more reader-friendly" move indicating that in cutting out the "flabby or redundant prose in longer pieces" the reduction would make for a better paper. Similarly, Keller confronted the challenges of covering news with "less room" by proposing more "rigorous editing" and promised an ongoing commitment to "hard-hitting, ground-breaking journalism".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/07/seinfeld-is-becoming-a-smart-phone-using-binge-watching-millennial/ |title=New York Times to Cut Size 5 Percent; Keller Says Paper Better Off Smaller &#124; the ''New York Observer'' |work=The New York Observer |date=July 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 15, 2008}}</ref> The official change went into effect on August 6, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 18, 2008|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=38405&c=1|title=New York Times trims paper size to cut costs | work=Press Gazette|date=August 7, 2007 }}</ref>

The ''Times Reader'' is a digital version of ''The New York Times''. It was created via a collaboration between the newspaper and [[Microsoft]]. ''Times Reader'' takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting. ''Times Reader'' uses a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] team. It was announced in [[Seattle]] in April 2006 by [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Tom Bodkin]]. In 2009 the ''Times Reader'' 2.0 was rewritten in [[Adobe AIR]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://firstlook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/times-reader-20-is-now-available/ | work=The New York Times | title=Times Reader 2.0 Is Now Available | date=May 12, 2009}}</ref>  In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the Times Reader app would be discontinued on January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only "Today's Paper" app.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/extras/reader/reader.html | work=The New York Times | title=Important Information About Times Reader | date=December 25, 2013}}</ref>

In 2008, ''The New York Times'' created an [[Application software|app]] for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]] which allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal. In April 2010, ''The New York Times'' announced it will begin publishing daily content through an [[iPad]] app.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/02/the-new-york-times-launches-free-ipad-app-for-real-now-paid-app-on-the-way/ | title = The New York Times Launches Free iPad App (For Real Now), Paid App On The Way |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=April 2, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2011 |author=Robin Wauters}}</ref> {{as of|2010|10|df=US}}, ''The New York Times'' iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated  into a [[Subscription business model|subscription-based model]] in 2011.<ref name=ipad />

A 2003 study in ''The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics'' concluded that ''The New York Times'' reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians.<ref name="viser">{{cite journal|title=Attempted Objectivity: An Analysis of the New York Times and Ha'aretz and their Portrayals of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=September 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=114–120|doi=10.1177/1081180X03256999|author=Matt Viser|quote=This study explores the biases, pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian, by looking at quantitative indicators of news coverage in the New York Times and Ha'aretz.

[[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity.

''The New York Times''{{'}} public editor [[Clark Hoyt]] concluded in his January 10, 2009, column, "Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think ''The New York Times'', largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job&nbsp;— and has largely succeeded." <ref>{{cite news | author = Hoyt, Clark | authorlink = Clark Hoyt | date = January 10, 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/opinion/11pubed.html?pagewanted=all | title = Standing Between Enemies | work = The New York Times}}</ref>

Former ''New York Times'' journalist [[Daniel H. Simpson|Daniel Simpson]] has criticized the newspaper's bias in representing wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

====World War II====
On November 14, 2001, in ''The New York Times''{{'}} 150th anniversary issue, former executive editor [[Max Frankel]] wrote that before and during World War II, the ''Times'' had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on [[the Holocaust]] in their news pages.<ref name="frankel">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/specials/onefifty/20FRAN.html | title=Turning Away From the Holocaust | work=The New York Times | author=Max Frankel | date= November 14, 2001 | authorlink= Max Frankel }}</ref> [[Laurel Leff]], associate professor of journalism at [[Northeastern University]], concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] targeting of [[Jew]]s for [[Holocaust|genocide]]. Her 2005 book ''[[Buried by the Times]]'' documents the NYT's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning [[Jewishness]], [[antisemitism]], and [[Zionism]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper|last = Leff|first = Laurel|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 0-521-81287-9|location = New York|year = 2005}}</ref>

The ''Times'' has been criticized for the work of reporter [[Walter Duranty]], who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936. Duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the [[Soviet Union]] and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the [[Holodomor|Ukrainian famine]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&lr=#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false |title=Assignment in Utopia |last=Lyons |first=Eugene |publisher=Greenwood Press Reprint |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=ConqRav>Conquest, R. <u>Reflections on a Ravaged Century</u>.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, "For the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the prize away."<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm "N.Y.

===Fashion news articles promoting advertisers===
In the mid to late 1950s, "fashion writer[s]... were required to come up every month with articles whose total column-inches reflected the relative advertising strength of every ["department" or "specialty"] store ["assigned" to a writer]... The monitor of all this was... the advertising director [of the ''Times'']... " However, within this requirement, story ideas may have been the reporters' and editors' own.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony'', pp. 82–83 (page break between "the" & "relative"; & quotations in brackets per ''id.'', p. 82). The requirement is not given a date except that the author was in "New York in 1955" and then went to be "interview[ed]" by a ''Times'' "hiring" "assistant", ''id.'', p. 77, she was temporarily hired at age 28 to work in "the women's news department" "as a news assistant" for "a special fashion section", ''id.'', p. 78, and the department was "[her] home for the next five years," ''id.'', p. 79. It is not stated whether the requirement began earlier or continued later.</ref>

===Plagiarism===
In May 2003, ''Times'' reporter [[Jayson Blair]] was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in ''The New York Times''{{'}} initial reluctance to fire him.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 15, 2008|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/media_ethics/casestudy_blair.php|title=Jayson Blair: A Case Study of What Went Wrong at The New York Times | work = [[PBS Newshour]]|date=December 10, 2004 }}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref>

===Duke University lacrosse case===
The newspaper was criticized for largely reporting the prosecutors' version of events in the 2006 [[Duke lacrosse case]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Taylor, Jr., Stuart |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2006/08/witness_for_the_prosecution.html |title=Witness for the Prosecution?{{spaced ndash}} The New York Times Is Still Victimizing Innocent Dukies |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date= August 29, 2006 |accessdate= December 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Until-Proven-Innocent-Correctness-Injustices/dp/0312369123 |title=Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case (9780312369125): Stuart Taylor, KC Johnson: Books |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}</ref> Suzanne Smalley of ''[[Newsweek]]'' criticized the newspaper for its "credulous"<ref name=NewsweekNYT>{{Cite news

===Quotes out of context===
In February 2009, a ''[[Village Voice]]'' music blogger accused the newspaper of using "chintzy, ad-hominem allegations" in an article on [[British Tamil]] music artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] concerning her activism against the [[Sri Lankan civil war|Sinhala-Tamil conflict]] in Sri Lanka.<ref name="villagevoice1">{{cite web|author=Baron, Zach|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/04/the_sri_lankan.php|title=The Sri Lankan Government's War with M.I.A. continues|work= [[The Village Voice]]|accessdate= April 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/world/asia/11mia.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Dissonant Undertones of M.I.A | first=Thomas | last=Fuller | date=February 11, 2009}}</ref> M.I.A. criticized the paper in January 2010 after a travel piece rated post-conflict Sri Lanka the "#1 place to go in 2010".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/travel/10places.html|title=The 31 Places to Go in 2010 | work=The New York Times | date=January 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2010/01/13/that-new-mia-track-is-actually-a-protest-song-called-space-odyssey/|title=That New MIA Track Is Actually a Protest Song Called 'Space Odyssey'|work=[[The Fader]]|date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=May 26, 2010|first=Julianne|last=Escobedo Shepherd}}</ref> In June 2010, ''The New York Times Magazine'' published a correction on its cover article of M.I.A., acknowledging that the interview conducted by current ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'' editor and then-''Times Magazine'' contributor Lynn Hirschberg contained a recontextualization of two quotes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30mia-t.html | work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]| title=M.I.A.'s Agitprop Pop | first=Lynn | last=Hirschberg | date=May 25, 2010}}</ref><ref name="mtvnytcon">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1640667/20100603/mia__4_.jhtml|title= M.I.A.

===Delayed publication of 2005 NSA warrantless surveillance story===
The ''New York Times'' has been criticized for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story revealing the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|warrantless surveillance program]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grieve|first1=Tim|title=What the Times knew, and when it knew it|url=http://www.salon.com/2006/08/14/times_24/|accessdate=July 26, 2014|agency=Salon|date=August 14, 2006}}</ref> Ex-NSA officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists [[James Risen]] and [[Eric Lichtblau]], who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's [[2004 Presidential Election (United States)|presidential election]]. Contact with former agency officials began the previous summer.<ref>{{cite news|title=NY Times, Justice Dept. under fire for concealing info on NSA snooping|url=http://rt.com/usa/158780-nyt-justice-withheld-nsa-info/|accessdate=July 18, 2014|agency=RT|date=May 14, 2014}}</ref>

Former ''NYT'' executive editor [[Bill Keller]] decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the Bush administration and being advised not to do so by ''Times'' Washington bureau chief [[Philip Taubman]]. Keller explained the silence's rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013, stating "Three years after 9/11, we, as a country, were still under the influence of that trauma, and we, as a newspaper, were not immune".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Margaret|title=Lessons in a Surveillance Drama Redux|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/public-editor/sullivan-lessons-in-a-surveillance-drama-redux.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=July 18, 2014|agency=The New York Times|date=November 9, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, ''[[PBS Frontline]]'' interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, who said that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. "The editors were furious at me," Risen said to the program. "They thought I was being insubordinate." Risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after the ''Times'' declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told [[NPR]] that the newspaper "avoided disaster" by ultimately publishing the story.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Folkenflik|first1=David|title='New York Times' Editor: Losing Snowden Scoop 'Really Painful'|url=http://www.npr.org/2014/06/05/319233332/new-york-times-editor-losing-snowden-scoop-really-painful|accessdate=July 18, 2014|agency=NPR|date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>
