'''''Late Show with David Letterman''''' is an American [[late-night talk show]] hosted by [[David Letterman]] on [[CBS]], the first iteration of the ''[[Late Show (CBS TV series)|CBS Late Show]]''. The show debuted on August 30, 1993,<ref name="mbc">[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/L/htmlL/latenightwi/latenightwi.htm Late Night with David Letterman / Late Show with David Letterman] from the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]</ref> and is produced by Letterman's production company, [[Worldwide Pants Incorporated]] and [[CBS Television Studios]]. The show's [[music director]] and leader of the house band, the [[CBS Orchestra]], is [[Paul Shaffer]]. The head writer is Matt Roberts and the announcer is [[Alan Kalter]]. Of the major U.S. late-night programs, ''Late Show'' ranks second in cumulative average viewers over time and third in number of episodes over time. In most U.S. markets the show airs from 11:35&nbsp;p.m. to 12:37&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and is recorded Monday through Wednesdays at 4:30&nbsp;p.m., and Thursdays at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. The second Thursday episode usually airs on Friday of that week.<ref name="taped"/>

In 2002, ''Late Show with David Letterman'' was ranked No.&nbsp;7 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|date=February 11, 2009|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml |title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> CBS has a contract with Worldwide Pants to continue the show through 2015.

==History==
CBS had previously attempted late-night talk shows with ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' (1969–1972) and ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'' (1989–1990), but these were unable to compete with NBC's ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and were canceled due to poor ratings. For most of the 20 years preceding ''Late Show'', CBS's late night fare consisted of movies, reruns and specialty programming packaged under the title ''[[The CBS Late Movie|CBS Late Night]]'' and broadcast to middling ratings. When David Letterman became available following [[The Tonight Show#Jay Leno (1992–2009)|a conflict with NBC]], CBS was eager to lure him and offered him a three-year, $14 million per year contract,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305416,00.html|title=Is Dave Worth It?|work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Mark |last=Harris|date=January 29, 1993|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> doubling his ''Late Night'' salary. According to their agreement, the show would spend a month in Hollywood at least once a year.<ref name="NYT" />

CBS purchased the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] for $4 million, spending "several million" to renovate it.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web|last=Carter |first=Bill |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/theater/cbs-buys-a-theater-to-keep-letterman-on-new-york-s-stage.html |title=CBS Buys a Theater To Keep Letterman On New York's Stage |work=The New York Times |date=February 22, 1993|accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> The renovation was supervised by architect [[James Polshek]].<ref name="NYT" /> CBS' total cost for acquiring the show including renovations, negotiation rights paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer [[Bill Wendell]], Shaffer, the writers and the band was over $140 million.<ref>[http://mancave.cbslocal.com/2011/04/11/david-letterman-keeping-us-up-late/ "David Letterman: Keeping Us Up Late"], Mancave, April 11, 2011.</ref>

When Letterman moved to CBS and began ''Late Show'', several of ''Late Night''{{'}}s long-running comedy bits made the move with him. Letterman renamed a few of his regular bits to avoid legal problems over [[trademark]] infringement (NBC cited that what he did on ''Late Night'' was "[[intellectual property]]" of the network). "Viewer Mail" on NBC became the "CBS Mailbag",<ref name="mbc" /> and Larry "Bud" Melman began to use his real name, [[Calvert DeForest]]. Paul Shaffer's "World's Most Dangerous Band" became "The CBS Orchestra", a jab at NBC regarding the show's new home, and a play on the [[The Tonight Show Band|NBC Orchestra]] of the long running ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Letterman's signature bit, the [[Top 10 List|Top Ten List]], was perfunctorily renamed the "Late Show Top Ten List" (over time it was simply referred to again by its original name).

After Letterman was introduced on ''Late Show''{{-'}}s very first episode, ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' anchor [[Tom Brokaw]] accompanied him on stage and wished him "reasonably well". As part of a pre-arranged act, Brokaw then proceeded to retrieve a pair of [[cue cards]] while stating that "These last two jokes are the intellectual property of NBC!" After he carried them off stage, Letterman responded, "Who would have thought you would ever hear the words 'intellectual property' and 'NBC' in the same sentence?" In his opening monologue, Letterman said "Legally, I can continue to call myself Dave"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D9173FF932A0575BC0A965958260 |title=Review/Television; New Time, New Place, Same Humor |work=The New York Times |date=1993-08-31 |accessdate=2011-05-15|author=Janet Maslin}}</ref> but joked that he woke up that morning and next to him in bed was the head of a [[NBC logos|peacock]] (while the orchestra played the theme from ''[[The Godfather]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0DF113CF936A3575AC0A965958260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FL%2FLeno%2C%20Jay |title=AUG. 29–Sept. 4; Mega-Mouths: Jay and Dave Head-to-Head |work=The New York Times |date=1993-09-05 |accessdate=2011-05-15|author=Tom Kuntz}}</ref>

In ratings, Letterman's ''Late Show'' dominated [[Jay Leno]]'s ''Tonight Show'' for its first two years. Leno pulled ahead on July 10, 1995, starting with a [[Hugh Grant]] interview, after Grant's much-publicized arrest for picking up an LA prostitute.<ref name="Hugh Grant Arrest">{{cite news |first=Natalie |last=Finn|title=Tonight Show Turns 15|publisher=[[E!

Likewise, the CBS network was hindered by a weak prime time lineup, along with several large- and major-market [[U.S. television network affiliate switches of 1994|affiliation switches in late 1994]] relating to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s acquirement of CBS's [[National Football League]] rights, stunting the ''Late Show'' just as it was beginning to gain traction.

Announcer [[Bill Wendell]] left in 1995,<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-18/entertainment/ca-36624_1_david-letterman-show</ref> with [[Alan Kalter]] taking his place.

At times ''Late Show'' even came in third in its time slot (behind ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', most recently in November 2008), once prompting Letterman to arrange for a [[Manhattan]] [[Billboard]] proudly declaring himself and his show to be No.&nbsp;3 in Late Night, aping an older, nearby billboard which promoted Leno and ''The Tonight Show'' as No.&nbsp;1.

On June 1, 2009, [[Conan O'Brien]] (who had succeeded Letterman as [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|host of ''Late Night'']] in 1993) took over as host of ''The Tonight Show''—an event Letterman referenced in his own show's Top Ten List on that night—and Letterman's "feud" with Leno temporarily ceased. In 2008 Letterman told ''Rolling Stone'' that he would welcome Leno on his show once Leno's tenure ended.<ref name="Letterman baffled">{{cite news |title=Letterman baffled by NBC's replacing of Leno |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/television/03lett.html |last=Stelter |first=Brian |work=The New York Times |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> Letterman said on competing with O'Brien, "I still find it hard to believe that Jay won’t be there."<ref name="Letterman baffled"/> The interview was held prior to Leno announcing his return to NBC for ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''.<ref name="Letterman baffled"/> In the second week after Letterman and O'Brien began their opposing broadcasts, viewer ratings for ''Tonight'' began to slip and ''Late Show'' was poised to beat ''Tonight'' for the first time in over ten years,<ref name="Letterman baffled"/><ref name="Who's loyal">{{cite web |title=Who's loyal to Leno, O'Brien, and Letterman? |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Television/story?id=7797222&page=1 |last=Fisher |first=Luchina |publisher=ABC News |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> a fact pointed out by Letterman's guests on air ([[Howard Stern]] and [[Julia Roberts]]).<ref name="Who's loyal"/><ref name="Roberts sides">{{cite web |title=Roberts sides with Letterman |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31210920/ |author=Access Hollywood |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> Letterman quickly tried to change subject in the interviews and tried to avert a new rivalry.<ref name="Who's loyal"/><ref name="Roberts sides"/> In fact, the June 9, 2009 episode of ''Late Show'' featuring Roberts rated better than ''Tonight'' with a 3.4 household rating nationally to O'Brien's 2.9.<ref name="Who's loyal"/><ref name="Roberts helps">{{cite web |title=David Letterman: Julia Roberts helps him beat Conan O'Brien for first time; Denzel Washington, Jonas Brothers visit Thursday |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2009/06/david-letterman-julia-roberts-helps-him-beat-conan-obrien-for-first-time-regis-philbin-to-give-top-t.html |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> The Letterman/Leno feud was revived in the wake of the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict]], which saw Letterman side with O'Brien.<ref name="Dave with CoCo">{{cite web |title=Why Jay Leno and David Letterman Hate Each Other |url=http://www.popeater.com/2010/01/27/why-jay-leno-and-david-letterman-hate-each-other/ |last=Ryan |first=Mike |publisher=PopEater |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> However, Leno appeared in a ''Late Show'' promo with Letterman and [[Oprah Winfrey]] aired on CBS during [[Super Bowl XLIV]]; it was Leno and Letterman's first joint appearance since Leno took over the ''Tonight Show'' in 1992. The feud between the hosts ended for good on February 6, 2014 with Leno's second and final retirement and ''Late Night'' host [[Jimmy Fallon]], who succeeded Conan O'Brien in 2009, becoming the current host of the ''Tonight Show'' on February 17, with its subsequent return to New York for the first time since 1972.

On April 3, 2012, CBS reached an agreement with Worldwide Pants and CBS Television Studios to continue the show through 2014. The parties reached another agreement in October 2013 to extend the show an additional year, continuing the series into 2015.<ref name="cbscorporation.com">{{cite press release|url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=871 |title=CBS announces new contract extensions with late night stars David Letterman and Craig Ferguson through 2015 |publisher=CBS Corporation |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref> Including his 11 years on NBC, Letterman is the longest tenured late-night talk show host, having surpassed [[Johnny Carson]].<ref name="Bibel"/>

On April 10, 2014, one week after Letterman announced that he would retire as host of the ''Late Show'' in 2015, CBS announced that [[Stephen Colbert]] (host of competing late night series ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on [[Comedy Central]]) would succeed Letterman as the host of the program after Letterman retires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen Colbert Next Host of 'The Late Show'|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/news/1002302/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>

Director [[Hal Gurnee]] and producer [[Peter Lassally]] left the show soon after to pursue other interests. Gurnee was replaced by Jerry Foley. Burnett was absent from the day-to-day operations from 2000 to 2004, and was replaced by [[Barbara Gaines (television producer)|Barbara Gaines]] and Maria Pope, both of whom continue to serve as executive producers, with Gaines currently acting as on-air producer.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In [[2003 in television|2003]], producer Jude Brennan was added to the team of executive producers.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107331/ Jude Brennan] at [[IMDb]]</ref>

Lassally, who had served as an executive producer for Johnny Carson on ''The Tonight Show'', was invited back to ''Late Show'' in January 2005 as a guest to discuss the recent death of Carson. Lassally served as executive producer for Worldwide Pants' ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' from 1995 to 2014, encompassing the tenures of hosts [[Tom Snyder]], [[Craig Kilborn]] and [[Craig Ferguson]]. He retired at the end of 2014, when Ferguson left to pursue other interests and Worldwide Pants' association with ''Late Late Show'' came to an end.

==Production==

===Studio and set design===
[[File:Michelle Obama on the Late Show with David Letterman.jpg|thumb|Letterman interviewing [[Michelle Obama]] in 2012]]
The show has been taped at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] at the corner of [[Broadway (Manhattan)| Broadway]] and [[53rd Street]] in midtown Manhattan since its inception. Formerly called CBS Studio 50, it had been home to several TV programs over the years, most notably ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Letterman has made use of the immediate neighborhood surrounding the theater for his show, closing off the portion of 53rd Street that goes past his studio for various stunts on occasion. Nearby merchants gained fame after making frequent appearances on the program, including [[Rupert Jee]], owner of the [[Hello Deli]] at 213 W. 53rd St., and [[Mujibur and Sirajul]], Bengali immigrants who worked at a souvenir shop close to the studio.

The stage layout has followed the same basic structure Letterman employed on ''Late Night'': the house band appears on the far left, followed by the performance area and then the interview set.

In May 2015, days before Letterman retired, [[Seth Stevenson]] described what it was like to attend a taping of the ''Late Show'':<ref>{{cite web|title= YouTube Killed the Studio Audience: What I learned from going to tapings of every late-night show | url= http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2015/05/late_night_s_live_tapings_what_it_s_like_to_be_in_the_studio_audience_for.2.html|work=Slate|date= May 10, 2015 |first=Seth |last=Stevenson |accessdate= 2015-05-11}}</ref>
<blockquote>"It felt almost regal to enter the Ed Sullivan Theater beneath a lit marquee on 53rd and Broadway instead of through some unmarked, dented metal door on an industrial block of Hell’s Kitchen. The theater for the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' seats 450 people instead of 100, and its rococo balcony offers a glorious vista over the sprawling stage where the [[The Ed Sullivan Show#Beatles|Beatles first performed in America]]. Instead of bathing us in washed-out, piped-in music, or a half-hearted pop quintet, Paul Shaffer and the CBS orchestra rocked us with a wall of sound, including a horn section that blasted riffs clear to the theater rafters....
It was hard not to sit in that ''Late Show'' studio audience and feel—for the first time—indispensable. Letterman puts on a show. He presents fully-rounded entertainment, and he feeds off the energy in the room. This is a big, brassy venue with a live orchestra, instead of a cramped black-box studio with somebody’s iPod plugged into ceiling speakers. And Letterman needed us there."
</blockquote>

===Same-day tapings===
When Letterman is not on vacation (which he takes roughly ten weeks per year<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,251464_2,00.html |title=A Dave New World |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2002-03-15 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}</ref>), he and his crew work four days per week, taping Friday's show earlier in the week.<ref name="taped">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060405034819/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/03/when-the-hell-does-letterman-tape-his-shows/ |title=When the hell does Letterman tape his shows? |author=Joel Keller |publisher=[[TV Squad]] |date=April 3, 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}</ref> From October 2001 until May 2004, Friday's show was taped on Thursdays. From 2004 to 2010, Friday's show was taped on Mondays.<ref name="taped" /> During this time, the Friday's show's monologue topics, [[Sketches featured on Late Show with David Letterman |sketches, and other segments]] were chosen for their lack of topicality, with few if any references to current events or any subject which would run the risk of seeming dated. However, in late 2011 the ''Late Show'' reverted to the practice of taping the Friday show on Thursdays, helping the Friday shows become more topical and relevant.

===Episode structure===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
The show's opening credits feature a series of shots of New York City as the CBS Orchestra performs the ''Late Show'' theme (a livelier variation of the more jazzy ''Late Night'' theme). The announcer presents the names of that night's guests, as well as Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra, then introduces Letterman. On rare episodes, the show begins with a [[cold open]] with Letterman in a baseball cap interacting with a celebrity.

In more recent years, Alan Kalter has included himself in the introduction. In addition, Letterman has taken to dashing across the stage either just before, during, or just after Kalter introduces him.

Letterman then walks out on the show stage to perform his stand-up [[monologue]], which may begin with a reference to something an audience member said to him during the pre-show question-and-answer session. The jokes are based on pop culture, current events, and politics. He then introduces one or two video jokes such as a running gag or fake commercial/public service announcement. The monologue is followed by Letterman's introduction of Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra. Beginning in 2009, a commercial break replaces Letterman's trademark 'crossing to the desk', which he had done since the early years. Letterman then chats with the audience and Shaffer, sometimes relating an anecdote from his personal life, sometimes discussing his anticipation of a particular guest; a [[running gag]] may be featured.

In 2005, after the death of Johnny Carson, it was revealed that Carson had made a habit of sometimes sending jokes to Letterman which Letterman would then incorporate into his monologues. The January 31, 2005, episode of the ''Late Show'', which featured a tribute to Carson, began with a monologue made up entirely of jokes written by Carson since his retirement.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 11, 2009 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-207_162-667673.html |title=Carson Feeds Jokes To Letterman |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/123709/letterman_pays_special_tribute_to_carson/ |title=Letterman Pays Special Tribute to Carson |publisher=redOrbit |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref>

Letterman reads the [[Top Ten list (David Letterman)|Top Ten List]] at this point before turning to guest interviews with a celebrity, politician, or other public figure. On most episodes, the first guest stays on through the commercial break and continues the interview.

Following the first guest is a short segment to bridge two commercial breaks sequentially. In earlier episodes, Letterman would return to his running gag during this break, or retry a failed stunt from earlier in the show. Later episodes include a brief comedy announcement from announcer Alan Kalter while showing the audience cheering.

The final segment consists of a live musical performance, a comedian performing a [[stand-up comedian|stand-up]] routine, or another guest interview. Musical guests have included artists from [[David Bowie]], [[U2]], [[Neil Young]], [[Coldplay]] to indie bands like [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], [[Gorillaz]] and [[MENEW]]. The [[CBS Orchestra]] frequently accompanies musical guests in performing their songs. Episodes occasionally conclude with Letterman recommending viewers stay tuned for ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson|Craig Ferguson]]'' (''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden|James Corden]]'' as of 2015), but usually he simply waves to the camera, saying, "Good night everybody!" In the latter part of the run, the admonishment to watch Craig Ferguson was delivered by Alan Kalter, via [[voiceover]].

===Regular sketches===
{{Main|List of David Letterman sketches}}
''Late Show'' has various repeated [[absurdism|absurdist]] segments, including those involving cast members' and audience participation. The show will also take a camera crew into the [[Hello Deli]] to show games such as "What's on the [[iPod]]?" and "Beat the Clock," or onto 53rd Street or the roof to record various stunts there.

===High-definition broadcasts===
The show began broadcasting in [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) on August 29, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=
Monday, August 29, 2005 |url=http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/the_wahoo_gazette/?year=2005&month=8&day=29&direct=true |date=August 29, 2005 |website=The Late Show Wahoo Gazette |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |quote=The High-Definition, Wide-Screen broadcasting of the LATE SHOW is exciting for everyone, especially those equipped with the High-Definition, Wide-Screen TV sets.}}</ref> About two weeks later, Tim Kennedy, the show's Technical Director, commented on the transition in the show's official newsletter:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
<blockquote>The biggest challenge in the HD conversion was to renovate and upgrade our old control room, audio room, videotape room, and edit room while still doing five shows a week. ... This entailed putting a remote [[production truck]] on 53rd Street running somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 feet of video and audio cable just to tie the truck to the existing technical plant ...</blockquote>
<blockquote>The coolest piece of equipment is our new control room Virtual Wall. We have done away with the conventional monitor for every video source and replaced it with four 70-inch [[rear projection screen]]s and within those screens we can "virtually" place as many video images as we want, anywhere we want them, and when we want it.</blockquote>
Kennedy and his crew won an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video for a Series" during the nearly four-month-long transition to HDTV.

Previously, only reruns without any special introductions had been aired since Letterman's temporary leave from the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/02/05/2000-02-05_dave_pals_to_cover_for_him_w.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=Dave Pals To Cover For Him While He Heals |date=February 5, 2000}}</ref>

Its second highest rated show aired on February 25, 1994 and had 11.1 million viewers. Both were preceded by the [[Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics#Ladies|ladies' figure skating competition]] which had high interest due to [[Tonya Harding#January 1994 incident|the attack on]] [[Nancy Kerrigan]] at the [[1994 United States Figure Skating Championships]] by Tonya Harding's ex-husband, and both women competing in the event.
