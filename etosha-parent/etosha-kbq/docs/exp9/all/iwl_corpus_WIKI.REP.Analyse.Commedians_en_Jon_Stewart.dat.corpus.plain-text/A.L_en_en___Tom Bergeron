'''Thomas''' "'''Tom'''" '''Bergeron''' (born May 6, 1955) is an American [[television personality]] and [[game show host]], best known as the host of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' (2001–2015) and host of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] reality series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' (2005–present). He was also host of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (1998–2004) and a fill-in host for ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. He is the winner of both a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].

==Early life and career==

Bergeron was born in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]], [[Massachusetts]] the son of Catherine "Kay" (née Costello) and Raymond Bergeron.<ref>http://www.eagletribune.com/haverhill/x1650959184/TV-host-Bergeron-returns-to-his-native-Haverhill-for-book-signing/print</ref> He is of [[French-Canadian]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] descent.<ref>[http://www.pqarchiver.com/titles?dids=1244789151:1244789151&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+17%252C+1999&author=DON+FREEMAN&pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&desc=%2560Squares'+host+sees+humor+go+full+circle&pqatl=google]</ref> His first job in broadcasting was as a [[disc jockey]] at local radio station [[WHAV]], in his home town of Haverhill, Massachusetts.  He became a popular radio DJ in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast area]] of [[New Hampshire]] in the early 1980s on [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth's]] [[WHEB]], where he played comedy records along with music and offbeat interviews.  His popularity led to additional TV and radio auditions.

One of his first jobs on television was as host of a local game show, ''[[Granite State Challenge]]'', on New Hampshire Public Television (produced at NHPTV flagship station [[WENH-TV]]).  He moved to the Boston market in February 1982, joining [[WBZ-TV]] as a general on-air personality.  His early roles at the station included being a contributor on ''[[Evening Magazine]]'' (1982–87), and hosting brief informational and show preview segments known as ''4 Today'', every 30 minutes during WBZ's daytime lineup (1983–87). In 1984, he landed the hosting spot on ''Lottery Live'', the nightly drawings of the Massachusetts State Lottery games. By January 1987, while still working in these roles, Bergeron added ''People Are Talking'' to his duties. He replaced outgoing host Buzz Luttrell on the early afternoon talk show, where he gained even more popularity. While Ron Cantera took over as host of ''4 Today'' (until its cancellation in 1988), Bergeron remained lottery host until drawings moved to [[WNEV-TV]] in September 1987.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bade|Brown|2003|pp=167–168}}</ref>

By the early 1990s, Bergeron was seen as a solid figure in Boston television, and WBZ continued to capitalize on his talents by featuring him on [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ Radio]]. It was there he had an early-morning radio show called ''The Tom Bergeron Show''. When ''People Are Talking'' ended a successful 13-year run in June 1993, Bergeron remained on WBZ-TV as commentator and lifestyle reporter for the station's expanded hour-long noon newscast. In early 1994, Bergeron briefly surfaced as a morning host on Boston's soft-rock station [[WMJX]] ("Magic 106.7"), which was only a short commute to WBZ's studios for his work on the noon news.

==Television==
In June 1994, Bergeron left WBZ when he was hired by the new [[FX Networks|FX]] cable network. He had been selected to co-host a morning talk show for them, called ''Breakfast Time'', which was his first network television exposure. Hosting with [[Laurie Hibberd]], the show became quite successful on the upstart cable network, prompting the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] to pick it up two years later. At the time, the cable system in his hometown of Haverhill didn't carry FX, leading to a long-running and ultimately failed public campaign to get them to pick up the channel or at the very least to locally [[Television syndication|syndicate]] the program. In September 1996, the program moved to Fox and became ''Fox After Breakfast'', since it aired later in the morning than the other network's morning programs. Bergeron and Hibberd continued with the show for one year on Fox; the show was renewed in 1997, but revamped. With new host [[Vicki Lawrence]], a new set and modified format, it became ''The Vicki Lawrence Show''.

Bergeron was promptly signed to a contract with [[ABC News]] as guest host to ''[[Good Morning America]]''. After [[Charles Gibson]] left the show, Bergeron was seriously considered as a permanent replacement,<ref>{{cite web|title='Dancing with the Stars' host Tom Bergeron rumored for 'GMA' position|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/dancing-with-stars-host-tom-bergeron-rumored-for-gma-position-1008569.php|work=Reality TV World |publisher=UPI News Service|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref> but that job went to [[Kevin Newman (Canadian journalist)|Kevin Newman]].

Beginning in 1998, he became the host of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. He was nominated for five [[Emmy]]s and in 2000, he won his first of two Emmy Awards. After ''Hollywood Squares'' ended its six-year-run in 2004, he continued hosting ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', which he started hosting in 2001, and he is also credited as the show's senior producer. Bergeron appeared twice on ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' as an alien trader named D'Marr (2002) and as a Coridan Ambassador (2005). He also appeared in an episode of ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'' in 1998.

In 2005, he began hosting the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] reality series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing With the Stars]]'', for ABC, where he had two former co-hostesses ([[Lisa Canning]] and [[Samantha Harris]]) before [[Brooke Burke]], the winner of [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 7)|season 7]], and later [[Erin Andrews]],who finished in third place of [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 10)|season 10]] took over the job. The show, modeled on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', proved to be a hit, and has now aired in over 90 countries in its various formats. His sharp sense of humor and good banter with the judges and cast members of ''Dancing With the Stars'' have helped to make him a big star again, so much so that in June 2010 ABC invited him back to his daytime roots for one day only as special guest moderator of "The View".

In 2005, Bergeron was a co-host on the [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon|Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon]], and in 2006 he was elected national vice president of the association.

In November 2009, Bergeron celebrated [[AFHV]]'s 20th anniversary with its first host [[Bob Saget]]. In 2010, he appeared in ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]''. In 2011, he made a cameo in an episode of ''[[Tosh.0]]'' as host of ''Dancing with the Internet Stars'', a parody of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.

In March 2011, Bergeron was one of the guest presenters to help promote [[KSBW]]'s second digital channel - Central Coast ABC.<ref>[http://www.ksbw.com/news/27242889/detail.html Editorial: ABC For The Central Coast]. KSBW.</ref> with the launch date of that channel was set for April 2011.

In 2012, Bergeron was selected to host [[A Capitol Fourth]], an annual Independence Day concert shown on [[PBS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2012/07/02/Bergeron-to-host-PBS-July-4-special/UPI-29431341263600/|title=Bergeron to host PBS' July 4 special|publisher=UPI|date=2012-07-02|accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

On March 12, 2014, Bergeron announced that he will not be hosting ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' after the 25th season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/03/12/tom-bergeron-quits-americas-funniest-home-videos/6321201/ | title=Tom Bergeron quits 'America's Funniest Home Videos' | work=USA Today | date=2014-03-12 | accessdate=2014-03-12 | author=Oldenburg, Ann}}</ref>

==Other career ventures==
In 2009, Bergeron released his first book ''I'm Hosting as Fast as I Can: Zen and the Art of Staying Sane in Hollywood''. The book details his career and other oddball stuff, along with some zen and life lessons.
