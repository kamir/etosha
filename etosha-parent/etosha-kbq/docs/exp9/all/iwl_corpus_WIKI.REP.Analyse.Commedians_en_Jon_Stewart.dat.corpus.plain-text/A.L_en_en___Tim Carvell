'''Tim Carvell''' is an American writer known for this work for the TV comedy series ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' and for his print work in publications such as ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

==Early life==
Tim Carvell is a native of [[Bloomfield Hills]], a suburb of [[Detroit]]. He entered [[Columbia University]] in 1991, majoring in history. While there, he wrote news and features for ''Spectator'' which he described as "as good a journalism education as you could get. It allowed you to learn by making mistakes, without suffering real consequences." He graduated in 1995.<ref name=CCToday/>

==Career==
For the first nine years after he graduated from college, Carvell wrote for a number of New York-based publications, including ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated for Women]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. He also contributed humor pieces to [[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|''McSweeney's Quarterly Concern'']]<ref name=CCToday/> and the op-ed page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=CCToday/><ref>Carvell, Tim (January 11, 2006). [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/11/opinion/11carvell.html "A Million Little Corrections"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

Carvell stumbled into a comedy career "by accident". He heard about an opening on the TV comedy series ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' from Steve Bodow, one of the writers on that show. He submitted a writing sample that consisted of the headlines that [[Jon Stewart]] reads at the desk and dialogue between Stewart and correspondents. Carvell was then interviewed by the show's head writer and the executive producer. He joined the show in March 2004, just as the [[2004 U.S. presidential campaign]] was becoming a common news topic.  Describing the subsequent meeting with Stewart as "surreal", Carvell says, "It felt uncannily like I was suddenly a guest on the show, only without a book or movie to promote."<ref name=CCToday/>

Carvell eventually became the series' head writer.<ref>Andreeva, Nellie (January 4, 2011).
