'''''Family Guy''''' is an American [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series centers on the [[Griffin family|Griffins]], a family consisting of parents [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]; their children [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; and their [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] pet dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, [[Rhode Island]], and exhibits much of its humor in the form of [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] that often lampoon [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|The Life of Larry]]'' and ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|Larry & Steve]]''. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of ''Family Guy'' had aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series, putting the series to a 2-year hiatus. However, favorable DVD sales and high [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]s for syndicated reruns on [[Adult Swim]] convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.

''Family Guy'' has been nominated for 12 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 11 [[Annie Award]]s, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in 1961. ''Family Guy'' has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Many [[tie-in]] media have been released, including ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', a [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD]] special released in 2005; ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'', a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and [[Walter Murphy]]; a [[Family Guy Video Game!|video game]] and [[pinball machine]], released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by [[HarperCollins|Harper Adult]] based on the ''Family Guy'' universe; and ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy]]'' (2010), a series of parodies of the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.

A spin-off series, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', featuring [[Cleveland Brown]], aired from September 27, 2009 to May 19, 2013. "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", a crossover episode with ''The Simpsons'', aired on September 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baldwin |first=Kristen |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode |title='The Simpsons,' 'Family Guy' doing crossover episode |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> ''Family Guy'' is a joint production by [[Fuzzy Door Productions]] and [[20th Century Fox Television]] and syndicated by [[20th Television]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fox.com/familyguy/about |title=About the Show |publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Family Guy'' the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.<ref name="tvguide1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time |publisher=Tvguide.com |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref>

These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason.<ref name="AOL">{{cite web |url=http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/seth-macfarlane |title='American Dad' and 'Family Guy' Creator Seth MacFarlane Is Animated About Work and Play |work=The TV Tattler|publisher=[[AOL|AOL Inc.]] |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |date=August 5, 2007}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.<ref name="Road to"/>

MacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology "[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]", which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like "[[Death Has a Shadow]]" and "[[Mind Over Murder]]". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off.<ref name=TVIGNFest>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/696/696615p1.html|title=William S.

Credited with 18 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on ''Family Guy'' staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series.

During the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed "a colossal dick move" in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975944.html?categoryid=2821 |title=Fox to air new ''Guy'' Sunday; MacFarlane hopes network changes plans |last=Adalian |first=Josef |work=Variety |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |accessdate=November 13, 2007 | date=November 13, 2007}}</ref> Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February 17, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20080424fox18 |title=Stewie Is On The Lam On "Family Guy" Sunday, May 18, On Fox |work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}</ref> According to MacFarlane, in 2009, it costs about $2 million to make an episode of ''Family Guy''.<ref>{{Cite episode|title = Seth MacFarlane Visits The Howard Stern Show|url = http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?month=April&day=27&year=2009&x=42&y=10|accessdate = January 19, 2013|series = [[The Howard Stern Show]]|first1 = Howard|last1 = Stern|authorlink1 = Howard Stern|first2 = Seth|last2 = MacFarlane|authorlink2 = Seth MacFarlane|network = [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]|station = [[Howard 100 and Howard 101#Howard 100 2|Howard 100]]|city = New York City|date = April 27, 2009|quote = How much does it cost to make an episode, a half hour episode of a cartoon?"

Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of its music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Named in the suit were [[20th Century Fox Film Corporation|20th Century Fox Film Corp.]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting Co.]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[Seth MacFarlane|MacFarlane]] and [[Walter Murphy|Murphy]]; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Bourne Co., vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc., Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc., The Cartoon Network, Inc., Seth MacFarlane, Walter Murphy |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court, Southern District of New York]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2010|url=http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/family%20guy%20complaint.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Bourne argued that "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in ''[[Campbell v.

In December 2007, ''Family Guy'' was again accused of copyright infringement when actor [[Art Metrano]] filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature "magic" act involving absurd "faux" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |title=Magician sues over cartoon Jesus |work=Chortle |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}</ref> 20th Century Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Arthur Metrano, vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Seth MacFarlane, Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein |court=[[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] |accessdate=April 27, 2010|date=December 5, 2007|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1206_metrano_fox_wm.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> In July 2009 a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved — "purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work" and "amount and substantiality of the taking" — counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth — "economic impact" — had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers — not Metrano or his act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2009/07/the-amazing-metrano-family-guy-and-fair-use.html |title=The Amazing Metrano, Family Guy, and Fair Use |first=Dave |last=Fagundes |date=July 20, 2009 |work=PrawfsBlawg |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}

The primary setting of ''Family Guy'' is Quahog ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|h|ɒ|ɡ}}  [pron. ko-hog or kwo-hog]), a [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional Rhode Island town]]. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at [[Rhode Island School of Design]], and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/familyguy/sethmacfarlane.asp |title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane, creator of The Family Guy |work=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=April 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611145603/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/familyguy/sethmacfarlane.asp|archivedate=June 11, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=James |last=Bartlett |url=http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/ |title=Seth MacFarlane&nbsp;– he's the "Family Guy" |work=Greatreporter.com |accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref> MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] and [[Buddy Cianci]] for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with a news program on [[WNAC-TV]], Channel 64 in Providence, stated that the town is modeled after [[Cranston, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Family Guy writer at Bryant |journal=[[The Providence Journal]] }}</ref>

The "Road to" episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/relying-on-stereotypes-family-guy-sticks-to-its-formula-cleveland-shows-a-softer-side-1.2001650#4 |title=Relying on stereotypes, 'Family Guy' sticks to its formula, 'Cleveland' shows a softer side |last=Phelps |first=Ben |work=[[Tufts Daily]]|quote=The show kicked off its eighth season with another entry in the now-classic "Road to ..." series, which allows for many different sight gags and opportunities for a wide range of humor. |publisher=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |date=October 16, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref name="tvsquadroadto">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/29/family-guy-road-to-rupert/ |title=Family Guy: Road to Rupert |publisher=[[America On Line]]|quote=The FG team went back to familiar territory this week, bringing us another "Road to..." episode. |work=[[TV Squad]] |last=Love |first=Brett |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/105/1057773p2.html |title=Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures |publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN |last=Haque |first=Ahsan |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> They are a parody of the seven ''[[Road to...]]'' comedy films starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]].<ref name="tvsquadroadto"/> These episodes have always involved [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] in some foreign, supernatural or science-fiction location, unrelated to the show's normal location in Quahog. The first, entitled "[[Road to Rhode Island]]", aired on May 30, 2000, during the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]]. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate [[number (music)|musical numbers]], similar to the ''Road'' films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/890/890465p5.html |title=The Cleveland Show Casting Couch |publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN |last=Iverson |first=Dan |author2=Lowe, Scott |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref> The episodes contain several trademarks, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom [[musical cue]]s and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/759/759248p1.html |title=Family Guy: "Road to Rupert" Review |publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN |last=Iverson |first=Dan |date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

The original idea for the "Road to" episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope and Lamour. The first episode was directed by [[Dan Povenmire]], who would direct the rest of the "Road to" episodes until the episode "[[Road to Rupert]]", at which point he had left the show to create ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.<ref name="QA">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736|title= Q&A: Dan Povenmire|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090822162217/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736|archivedate=November 24, 2009|author= Bond, Paul.|date= June 7, 2009|publisher=e5 Global Media|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081024123628/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|archivedate=October 24, 2008|publisher=[[RealNetworks]]|work=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Europe|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire's role as director of the "Road to" episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091017073610/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|archivedate=October 17, 2009|publisher=RealNetworks|work=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Germany|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref>

The "Road to" episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series, thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian, and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/12/family-guy-stewie-and-brians-greatest-adventures |archiveurl=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/12/family-guy-stewie-and-brians-greatest-adventures|archivedate=January 11, 2010|publisher=IGN|work=IGN|title=Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures |accessdate=December 23, 2013}}</ref>

===Humor===
''Family Guy'' uses the filmmaking technique of [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]], which occur in the majority of ''Family Guy'' episodes.<ref name=fhm>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhm.com/reviews/tv/seth-macfarlane--exclusive-interview-with-the-family-guy-guy-20090624 |title=''Family Guy''{{'}}s Seth MacFarlane interviewed! |work=[[FHM]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}</ref> Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.

Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's "super villain" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at [[matricide]]. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.<ref name=matee/> ''Family Guy'' often includes [[Meta-reference|self-referential]] humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters [[Fourth wall|break the fourth wall]] by addressing the audience. For example, in "[[North by North Quahog]]", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]'', ''[[Undeclared]]'', ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', ''[[That '80s Show]]'', ''[[Wonderfalls]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', ''[[Skin (TV series)|Skin]]'', ''[[Girls Club (TV series)|Girls Club]]'', ''[[Cracking Up (TV series)|Cracking Up]]'', ''[[The Pitts]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Get Real (U.S. TV series)|Get Real]]'', ''[[Freakylinks]]'', ''[[Wanda at Large]]'', ''[[Costello (TV series)|Costello]]'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', ''[[A Minute with Stan Hooper]]'', ''[[Normal, Ohio]]'', ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]'', ''[[Harsh Realm]]'', ''[[Keen Eddie]]'', ''[[The $treet]]'', ''[[The American Embassy]]'', ''[[Cedric the Entertainer Presents]]'', ''[[The Tick (2001 TV series)|The Tick]]'', ''[[Luis (TV series)|Luis]]'', and ''[[Greg the Bunny]]''. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during ''Family Guy''{{'}}s hiatus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101206165055/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|title='Dad' Joins MacFarlane's 'Family'|work=New York Daily News|author=Bianculli, David|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Back in the Fold|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=April 28, 2005|page=W37}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=An amazing comeback cartoon&nbsp;— Why Fox resurrected Family Guy|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|location=Bergen County, New Jersey|date=May 1, 2005|author=Rohan, Virginia}}</ref>

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's "Giggity giggity goo", Peter's "Freakin' sweet", and Joe's "Bring it on!"<ref name=matee>{{cite web|publisher=New Corporation|work=IGN|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p8.html|title= Top 25 Family Guy Characters|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}</ref> The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode "[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims "[[D'oh!]]", to which Lois replies, "No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20318518,00.html |title=Tiffani Thiessen Is Expecting a Baby |publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |author=Jordan, Julie |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

===Books===
'''''Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One''''' was written by executive story editor Chevapravatdumrong and actress [[Alex Borstein]]. The book was first published on 8 May 2007.<ref name="Publication">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061143328/Family_Guy_It_takes_a_Village_Idiot_and_I_Married_One/index.aspx|title=Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin discussing her memories of growing up and to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog.

In 2007, at the [[59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]], MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song "The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C." performed in the episode ''[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]''. The song insulted TV shows such as ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', as well as the [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|final scene]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

In 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled ''Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show'', in which voice actors [[Alex Borstein]] and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" in the voice of [[Marlee Matlin]], who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance.
