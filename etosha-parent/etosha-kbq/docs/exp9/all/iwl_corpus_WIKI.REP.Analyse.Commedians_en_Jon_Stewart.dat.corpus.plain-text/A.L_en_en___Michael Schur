Schur and Anne Herbert, and was raised in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref name="Wedding" /><ref>https://twitter.com/KenTremendous/status/303332060137926656</ref> Michael Schur first became interested in comedy when he was 11 years old, when he read ''[[Without Feathers]]'', a 1975 collection of humorous essays by [[Woody Allen]]. Schur said he found the book on his father's bookshelf and stayed up reading it until 4 a.m.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Martin |first=Denise |title=Making bureaucracy work: How NBC's "Parks and Recreation" overcame bad buzz |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-11-18 |location=[[Los Angeles]], [[California]] |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/11/parks-and-recreation.html |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>

Schur attended [[William H.

==Career==
Schur wrote for six seasons on NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' until 2004. Soon after, he became producer and writer for ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' on NBC, for which he wrote ten episodes. Schur appeared on ''The Office'' as [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]]'s cousin [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] in the episodes "[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]," in which Dwight takes [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan]] to his [[beet]] farm, "[[Money (The Office)|Money]]," in which Jim and Pam spend a night at the farm, "[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]]", "[[Koi Pond (The Office)|Koi Pond]]", and "[[Counseling (The Office)|Counseling]]." He also co-wrote ''[[List of The Office (U.S. TV series) episodes#Webisodes|The Office: The Accountants]]'' [[webisode]]s with [[Paul Lieberstein]].

In 2005, Schur served as a co-producer of [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Comeback (TV series)|The Comeback]]'' and wrote two of its thirteen episodes.

Schur also wrote for "[[Fire Joe Morgan]]," a sports journalism blog, under the pseudonym "Ken Tremendous."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2005/04/about-us.html|title=Fire Joe Morgan: About Us|publisher=firejoemorgan.com|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> Schur resurrected the pen name on March 31, 2011, when he began writing for SBNation's Baseball Nation site. Ken Tremendous is also Schur's Twitter username.

In April 2008, Schur and [[Greg Daniels]] started working on a pilot for ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' as a proposed [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''The Office''. Over time, Schur realized ''Parks and Recreation'' would work better as a show if they made it separate from ''The Office''. While ''Parks and Recreation'' received negative reviews in its first season, it received critical acclaim in the second much like ''The Office''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Schur collaborated with [[The Decemberists]] on their music video for ''Calamity Song'' from the album ''[[The King Is Dead (album)|The King Is Dead]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carlin|first=Shannon|title=First Watch: The Decemberists, 'Calamity Song'|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=2011-08-22|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/08/22/139033489/first-watch-the-decemberists-calamity-song |accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref> This video is based upon Eschaton, a mock-nuclear war game played on tennis courts that [[David Foster Wallace]] created in his 1996 novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.
