'''''Naked Pictures of Famous People: Another Example of Blatantly False Advertising''''' is a collection of essays and short stories written in 1998 by [[Jon Stewart]], who now hosts ''[[The Daily Show]]''.  It was the first book Stewart wrote, followed by ''[[America (The Book)]]'', which he co-authored with "The Daily Show" staff. ''Naked Pictures'' was a national best seller, known for its biting wit and [[political satire]].  It features several different formats for its chapters, from two person dialogues to formal letters.

The "chapters" include:
* "Breakfast at Kennedy's" - A journal of a man's friendship with [[John F. Kennedy]] and the [[Kennedy family]].
*"A Very Hanson Christmas: 1996-1999" - Christmas newsletters from the [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] family which get increasingly disturbing as the boys become famous.

* "Local News" - The death of the [[Taco Bell chihuahua]].
* "The Last Supper or the Dead Waiter" - The [[Last Supper]] from the point of view of a [[waiter]].
* "Da Vinci: The Lost Notebook" - [[Leonardo da Vinci|Da Vinci]]'s sketches describing unusual inventions.
* "The Cult" - Jon imagining himself as a [[cult]] leader.
* "Five Under Five" - Five notable kids under five years old.

* "Adolf Hitler: The Larry King Interview" - An interview with an apologetic [[Adolf Hitler]] on ''[[Larry King Live]]''.
* "Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Sitcom" - A fictional [[situation comedy|sitcom]] by [[Lenny Bruce]].
*"[[Microsoft Word]] '98 Suggested Spelling and Usage" - A list of [[Spell checker|spell check]] suggestions Jon encountered while writing the book.

Perhaps inspired by the title of the book, Stewart's collaboration with ''[[The Daily Show]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s team, ''[[America (The Book)]]'', actually included doctored "naked pictures" of the nine members of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].
