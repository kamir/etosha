'''Virginia''' <small>(</small>{{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Virginia.ogg|v|ɚ|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|j|ə}}<small>)</small>, officially the '''Commonwealth of Virginia''', is a [[U.S. state]] located in the [[South Atlantic States|South Atlantic region]] of the [[United States]]. Virginia is nicknamed the "Old Dominion" due to its status as a former dominion of the [[English Crown]],<ref name=encolddominion>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Old_Dominion|title=Old Dominion|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia}}</ref> and "Mother of Presidents" due to the [[List of Presidents of the United States by home state#Places of birth|many U.S. presidents]] having been born there. The geography and climate of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] are shaped by the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] is the most populous city, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population {{as of|2014|lc=on}} is over 8.3 million.<ref name=PopEstUS/>

The area's history begins with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|several indigenous groups]], including the [[Powhatan]]. In 1607 the [[London Company]] established the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first permanent [[New World]] [[Kingdom of England|English]] colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 Colonies]] in the [[American Revolution]] and joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]], during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties [[Wheeling Convention|seceded]] to form the state of [[West Virginia]]. Although the Commonwealth was under [[Solid South|single-party rule]] for nearly a century following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.<ref name=purple/>

The [[Virginia General Assembly]] is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the General Assembly|url=http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/virginiaLegislature.php?secid=20&activesec=2#!hb=1&mainContentTabs=4&content=4,includes/contentTemplate.php%3Ftid%3D52%26ctype%3Db%26cid%3D31|work=Website: Virginia General Assembly|publisher=State of Virginia|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref> The state government has been repeatedly ranked most effective by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]].<ref name=pew/> It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]; federal agencies in [[Northern Virginia]], including the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]; and military facilities in [[Hampton Roads]], the site of the [[Virginia Port Authority|region's main seaport]].<!--no source for this statement: Virginia's public schools and many [[List of colleges and universities in Virginia|colleges and universities]] have contributed to growing media and technology sectors.--> Virginia's economy changed from primarily agricultural to industrial during the 1960s and 1970s, and in 2002 [[integrated circuit|computer chips]] became the state's leading export.<ref name=chips/>

{{Main|Colony of Virginia}}
The first people are estimated to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref>[http://virginiaindians.pwnet.org/lesson_plans/Heritage%20Trail_2ed.pdf Karenne Wood, ed., ''The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail''], Charlottesville, VA: Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 2007.</ref> By 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the [[Algonquian peoples]] had founded towns such as [[Werowocomoco]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]], which they referred to as ''[[Tsenacommacah]]''. The other major language groups in the area were the [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] to the west, and the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoians]], who included the [[Nottoway Tribe|Nottoway]] and [[Meherrin]], to the north and south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under [[Chief Powhatan]] in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=4–11}} Powhatan controlled more than 30&nbsp;smaller tribes and over 150&nbsp;settlements, who shared a common [[Powhatan language|Virginia Algonquian]] language.

Tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to [[Bacon's Rebellion]] in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as 80% of the population.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=51–59}} Rebels, largely from the colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards [[Native American tribes in Virginia|native tribes]], and one result of the rebellion was the signing at [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]] of the [[Treaty of 1677]], which made the signatory tribes [[tributary state]]s and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of [[The College of William & Mary]] in 1693 and was renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] as it became the colonial capital in 1699.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=76–77}} In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the [[Ohio Company]], with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the [[Ohio Country]] west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Anderson|2000|p=23}} [[France]], which claimed this area as part of their colony of [[New France]], viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing [[French and Indian War]] became part of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763).

The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament's]] efforts to levy new taxes following the [[French and Indian War]] were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the [[House of Burgesses]], opposition to [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] was led by [[Patrick Henry]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio26.htm|title=Signers of the Declaration (Richard Henry Lee)|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=April 13, 2006|accessdate=February 2, 2008}}</ref> Virginians began to [[committee of correspondence|coordinate their actions]] with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] the following year.{{sfn|Gutzman|2007|pp=24–29}} After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the [[Virginia Conventions]].

When the [[American Revolutionary War]] began, [[George Washington]] was selected to head the [[Continental Army|colonial army]]. During the war, the capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack.{{sfn|Cooper|2007|p=58}} In 1781, the combined action of [[Continental Army|Continental]] and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the [[Virginia Peninsula]], where troops under George Washington and [[Comte de Rochambeau]] defeated British [[General Cornwallis]] in the [[Siege of Yorktown]].

Virginians were instrumental in writing the [[United States Constitution]]. [[James Madison]] drafted the [[Virginia Plan]] in 1787 and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1789.<ref name=mason/> [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|Virginia ratified]] the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The [[three-fifths compromise]] ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

Protests started by [[Barbara Rose Johns]] in 1951 in [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] against segregated schools led to the lawsuit ''[[Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]]''. This case, filed by Richmond natives [[Spottswood William Robinson III|Spottswood Robinson]] and [[Oliver Hill]], was decided in 1954 with ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]". But, in 1958, under the policy of "[[massive resistance]]" led by the influential segregationist Senator [[Harry F.

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] gained many participants in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965. In 1964 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ordered [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]] and others to [[racial integration|integrate]] schools.{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|pp=357}} In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on [[Interracial marriage in the United States|interracial marriage]] with ''[[Loving v.

In colonial Virginia, free men elected the lower house of the legislature, called the [[House of Burgesses]], which together with the Governor's Council, made the "General Assembly". Founded in 1619, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] is still in existence as the oldest legislature in the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=burgesses>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/06/AR2006050601099_pf.html|title=Latest Budget Standoff Met With Shrugs|first1=Rosalind S.|last1=Helderman|first2=Chris L.|last2=Jenkins|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 7, 2006|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}</ref> The modern government is ranked by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]] with an A− in terms of its efficiency, effectiveness, and infrastructure.

Since 1971, the government has functioned under the seventh [[Constitution of Virginia]], which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the [[federal government of the United States|federal structure]], the government is divided in [[Separation of powers|three branches]]: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]], a bicameral body whose 100-member [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and 40-member [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]] are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent [[List of Virginia Governors|governors]] cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms.<ref name=constitution>{{cite journal|title=Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia by A.

==State symbols==
{{Main|List of Virginia state symbols}}
[[File:Virginia new sign.jpg|thumb|The Virginia welcome sign at the Virginia welcome center on [[Interstate 95|I-95]] employs the state bird, the [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]], and the state tree and flower, the [[Cornus florida|dogwood]].|alt=A large square metal sign, mostly white, with the words Virginia Welcomes You in blue and red. In the center a red cardinal bird sits on a branch with two white flowers around it.]]
The state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "[[Dominion]]" by King [[Charles II of England]] at the time of [[The Restoration]], because it had remained loyal to the crown during the [[English Civil War]], and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title. Charles' supporters were called [[Cavalier]]s, and "The Cavalier State" nickname was popularized after the [[American Civil War]] to romanticize the antebellum period. Sports teams from the [[University of Virginia]] are called the [[Virginia Cavaliers|Cavaliers]].{{sfn|Welch|2006|pp=1–3}} The other nickname, "Mother of Presidents", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as [[Lists of United States Presidents by place of birth#By state of birth|President of the United States]], including four of the first five.<ref name=factpack/>

The state's motto, ''[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic Semper Tyrannis]]'', translates from Latin as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930.<ref name=factpack>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/class_media/4_5_pdfs/factpack-1.pdf|title=Factpack|publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]]|date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=October 14, 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/9-12/9_12_emb_symb.html|title=Capitol Classroom|publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]]|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=April 12, 2008}}</ref> The [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia reel]] is among the [[square dance]]s classified as the [[List of U.S. state dances|state dance]].<ref name=eov/> Virginia currently has no [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]].
