==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] leaves work, and when he is reminded that his [[Dieting|diet]] is starting on the first day of the month (which is that day), he decides to have one last [[wikt:binge|binge]] at [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s Fast-Food Boulevard. After filling up, he decides to throw away his wrappers and the contents of his car in a trash can outside of a [[Krusty Burger]], tossing away a leaky [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and a lit [[match]]. The acid from the leaky battery eats a hole in a gas main, with the lit match igniting the gas and starting a fire which soon causes nearby gas pipes to explode, completely destroying Fast-Food Boulevard.

At a town hall meeting, the enraged residents of [[Springfield (Simpsons)|Springfield]] demand that Fast-Food Boulevard be rebuilt immediately. To fund the reconstruction, a bond measure is proposed. As the next election isn't until June the next year, [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]] moves it to the upcoming Tuesday, making Springfield's presidential primary the first in the [[United States|nation]]. Candidates and reporters head to Springfield when they hear the news.

The candidates flock to the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]], who are undecided. Their home is filled with people and their yard is covered with reporters; helicopters and news vans surround the lot. When voting day arrives, an angry Homer and other citizens hold a meeting in [[Moe's Tavern]]. Homer suggests the people vote for the most ridiculous candidate, whom they choose after [[Chief Wiggum]] suggests himself. The same night, [[Kent Brockman]] announces an unexpected turn of events; Springfield has rejected all the leading candidates and voted for 8-year-old [[Ralph Wiggum]]. He wins the primary, much to the shock of [[Lisa Simpson]].

Ralph is immediately embraced as the leading candidate, and Homer and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become his fans. Lisa, however, is miserable, as she knows how slow Ralph is. A news report (called ''Headbutt'') shows Ralph has no idea of which party's nomination he is seeking. Both the Democratic and Republican parties contend to secure Ralph as their candidate. The leaders of both parties break into Ralph's home, wanting to fight for him. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] confronts Ralph amongst the media frenzy, attempting to convince him not to run. Ralph tells Lisa he wants to run so he can bring peace between warring parties and his earnest kind heartedness wins her support. He is proven to be a formidable candidate, and both the Republicans and the Democrats support Ralph for president. The episode ends with a [[Television advertisement|political commercial]] for Ralph, [[Bipartisanship|sponsored by both parties]].<ref name="FF"/>

===Controversy===
The episode caused controversy in [[Argentina]] prior to its broadcast there. The controversy is over an exchange between [[Lenny and Carl]]. Carl says "I could really go for some kind of [[military dictator]], like [[Juan Perón]]. When he '[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]' you, you stayed 'disappeared'!". Carl's comment is a reference to the [[Dirty War]] in Argentina, a period of military dictatorship during which as many as 30,000 Argentines disappeared, and is largely regarded as having begun during Perón's last government with the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]], a death squad which killed many left-wing dissidents. The clip was viewed on [[YouTube]] over ten thousand times in Argentina and some politicians in the country called for the episode to be censored or banned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/VR1117984017.html |

[[Lorenzo Pepe]], former Argentinian congressman and president of the Juan Domingo Perón Institute said "this type of program causes great harm, because the disappearances are still an open wound here."<ref name="Pepe"/> Some reacted negatively to [[Lenny and Carl#Lenny Leonard|Lenny]]'s response to Carl's comment: "Plus, his wife was [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]", a reference to the film ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' where Madonna played [[Eva Perón]].

In an unprecedented decision, Fox decided not to air the episode in [[Latin America]], except in [[Brazil]]. In an e-mail sent later to the media, the network said that this decision was based on "the possibility that the episode would contribute to reopen wounds very painful to Argentina". The Federal Broadcasting Committee made it clear that the episode was not aired in Argentina by Fox's own choice.<ref name="BBC Brasil" /> Nevertheless, some national TV networks in the region (such as [[Caracol TV|Caracol]] in [[Colombia]], [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]] in [[Chile]], [[Televen]] in [[Venezuela]] and [[Azteca 7|TV Azteca]] in [[Mexico]]) have aired the episode. Finally, on February 19, 2013, [[Telefe]] broadcast the episode [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in Argentina.
