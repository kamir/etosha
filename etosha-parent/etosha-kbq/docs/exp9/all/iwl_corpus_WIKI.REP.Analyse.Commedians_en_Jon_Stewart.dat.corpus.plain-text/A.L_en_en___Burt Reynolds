Reynolds' autobiography (''My Life'') does not name his birthplace, although it does cover his childhood in Lansing, and fails to mention Waycross at all. For more discussion on Burt Reynolds' birthplace, see ([[Talk:Burt Reynolds|'discussion page]])</ref>  Reynolds, his mother and sister joined his father at [[Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri#Military base|Fort Leonard Wood]], and lived for two years. When Reynolds' father was sent to Europe, the family returned to Lansing. In 1946, the family moved to [[Riviera Beach, Florida]]. His father became Chief of Police of [[Riviera Beach, Florida|Riviera Beach]], which is adjacent to the north of [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].

During [[10th grade]] at [[Palm Beach Lakes Community High School|Palm Beach High School]], Reynolds was named First Team All State and All [[Southeastern United States|Southern]] as a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], and received multiple scholarship offers.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 17, 33-7, 41-4</ref> After graduating from Palm Beach High in West Palm Beach, Reynolds attended  [[Florida State University]] on a [[college football|football]] scholarship, and played [[running back|halfback]].<ref>He was a member of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. Photo gallery of Reynolds at FSU: http://heritage.fsu.edu/photos/burtatfsu.html</ref> While at Florida State, Reynolds became roommates with now notable college football broadcaster and analyst [[Lee Corso]]. Reynolds hoped to be named to All-American teams and to have a career in professional football. However, Reynolds was injured in the first game of the season; a car accident later that year worsened the injury. With his college football career over, Reynolds considered becoming a police officer, but his father suggested that he finish college and become a [[Probation officer|parole officer]]. In order to keep up with his studies, he began taking classes at [[Palm Beach Community College|Palm Beach Junior College]] (PBJC) in neighboring [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]]. In his first term at PBJC, Reynolds was in a class taught by [[Watson B. Duncan III]]. Duncan pushed Reynolds into trying out for a play he was producing, ''[[Outward Bound (play)|Outward Bound]]''. He cast Reynolds in the lead role based on having heard Reynolds read Shakespeare in class. Reynolds won the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance in ''Outward Bound''. Reynolds calls Duncan his [[mentor]] and the most influential person in his life.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 57-9</ref> While at Florida State, Reynolds became a brother of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=161 |title=Phi Delta Theta International Site - Famous Phis |publisher=Phideltatheta.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>

==Career==

===Stage===
[[File:Burt Reynolds Gunsmoke 1962.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Reynolds in Gunsmoke (1962)]]
The Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a [[summer stock theater]], in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Reynolds saw the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically demanding summer jobs, but did not yet see acting as a possible career. While working there, Reynolds met [[Joanne Woodward]], who helped him find an agent and was cast in ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in [[New York City]]. After his Broadway debut ''Look, We've Come Through'', he received favorable reviews for his performance and went on tour with the broadway, driving the bus and appeared on stage.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 59-63.</ref> After the tour, Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes. His classmates included [[Frank Gifford]], [[Carol Lawrence]], [[Red Buttons]] and [[Jan Murray]]. After a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but he soon got a part in a revival of ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', in which [[Charlton Heston]] played the starring role. After the play closed, the director, [[John Forsythe]], arranged a film audition with [[Joshua Logan]] for Reynolds. The film was ''[[Sayonara]]''; Reynolds was told that he could not be in the film because he looked too much like [[Marlon Brando]]. Logan advised Reynolds to go to [[Hollywood]], but Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 63-5.</ref> Reynolds worked on odd jobs, such as waiting tables, washing dishes, driving a delivery truck and as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at the [[Roseland Ballroom]]. It was while working as a [[Stevedore|dockworker]] that Reynolds was offered $150 to jump through a glass window on a live television show.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 65-7.</ref>

Reynolds played Ben Frazer in the [[NBC]] series, ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'' and Tony Sapio in ''[[The Lawless Years]]'' episode, "The Payoff.

Later, Reynolds guest-starred in the syndicated [[crime drama]], ''[[The Brothers Brannagan]]'' in the episode "Bordertown". He went on to appear in a number of other shows, including three segments of the [[Ron Hayes]] syndicated adventure series ''[[The Everglades (TV series)|The Everglades]]''.

He played Quint Asper, the half-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[blacksmith]] and de facto deputy in [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' for three seasons, and the series generated widely circulated promotional photos of Reynolds in front of a barn on the Upper Iverson, including one that appears on the page. In 1962, Reynolds made a guest appearance on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' in "The Case of the Counterfeit Crank". In 1963, he played Rocky in ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode 155 "[[The Bard (The Twilight Zone)|The Bard]]" in which he amusingly lampooned his then-[[lookalike]] [[Marlon Brando]]. In 1965, he guest-starred as Technical Sergeant Chapman, a Flight Engineer in the second season episode 7, "Show Me A Hero" of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|12 O-Clock High]]''.<ref>{{Cite news| url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734451/|title= Show Me a Hero, I'll Show You a Bum |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate = May 20, 2014}}</ref>
Later, he starred in two short-lived cop shows: ''[[Hawk (TV series)|Hawk]]'' and ''[[Dan August]]''. He disparaged these shows, telling [[Johnny Carson]] that Dan August had "two forms of expression: "mean and meaner." Reynolds appeared on ABC's ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' hosted by outdoors [[journalist]] [[Grits Gresham]], who took celebrities on [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[shooting]] trips around the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Later that year, he worked as a guest [[color analyst]] on [[CBS Sports]]' telecast of the [[Sun Bowl]], teaming with [[Pat Summerall]] and [[Tom Brookshier]].

Stryker]]'', one of the rotating elements of the ''[[ABC Mystery Movie]]''. Reynolds tried his hand at producing two television shows with friend [[Bert Convy]], including ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]''. He appeared as a celebrity gameplayer in the inaugural week of the show along with [[Justine Bateman]], [[Debbie Reynolds]] and [[Loretta Swit]]. The set of the series was modeled after Reynolds' living room.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Another show Burt and Bert produced was titled ''[[3rd Degree (game show)|3rd Degree]]'' and like on ''Win, Lose, or Draw'', Burt appeared on a few episodes as a panelist from 1989 to 1990. He also played Wood Newton in the [[CBS]] sitcom, ''[[Evening Shade]]'', and won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Emmy Award]].<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/burt-reynolds Burt Reynolds Emmy Winner]</ref> In July 2010, he guest-starred as an ex-[[CIA]] agent being hunted down by a team of Russian assassins who wanted to kidnap, interrogate, then kill him, on [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[Burn Notice]]''. Part of this role depicted absent-mindedness which was noted in the closing scene as "not only being when he drank" implying his character suffered from some form of memory disability or disease.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the animated series ''[[Archer (TV series)|Archer]]'' episode "The Man from Jupiter", Reynolds guest-starred as himself who takes on a team of [[Cuba]]n hitmen and helps [[Sterling Archer]] who idolizes him.

===Film===
[[File:Burt Reynolds With Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game.jpg|left|thumb|Reynolds with the Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game, Florida State University, 1963]]
After his film debut ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'', Reynolds used his TV fame to secure leading roles in overseas low-budget films, his first leading role is a [[spy film]] ''[[Operation C.I.A.]]'' (1965), set in South Vietnam, but shot in Thailand. Later, Reynolds played the titular role in ''[[Navajo Joe]]''. The low-budget starring roles established Reynolds as a bankable leading man in films and earned him starring roles in American big-budget ones. Reynolds was under strong consideration by producer [[Saul David]] for the lead in ''[[Our Man Flint]]'' but was rejected by the influential [[Lew Wasserman]].<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/saul-david-2/the-industry-life-in-the-hollywood-fast-lane/</ref> Reynolds was offered the role of [[James Bond]] by [[Albert R. Broccoli]], when [[Sean Connery]] left the franchise, but turned the role down, saying "An American can't play James Bond. It just can't be done."<ref>[http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1038368.php]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> Broccoli offered the role to another non-Briton, Australian [[George Lazenby]]. He filmed ''[[Shark! (film)|Shark!]]'' in 1967 with [[Sam Fuller]] who disowned the cut of the film.<ref>Fuller, Samuel  ''Samuel Fuller: Interviews'' Univ. Press of Mississippi, 30 May 2012</ref> Reynolds later starred in Saul David's ''[[Skullduggery (1970 film)|Skullduggery]]'' (1970). His breakout performance in ''[[Deliverance]]'' (1972) made him a star and Reynolds gained notoriety when he posed naked in the April (Vol. 172, No. 4) issue of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17896980|title= Burt Reynolds nude: 10 facts about the Cosmo centrefold|publisher= [[BBC News]] |date = April 30, 2012}}</ref> Reynolds claims the centerfold in Cosmopolitan hurt the chances for the film and the cast from receiving [[Academy Award]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wenn|title=Burt Reynolds: Nude photo cost 'Deliverance' Oscar glory|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=771035|work=MSN|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> In 1977, Reynolds and [[Nick Nolte]] refused to play [[Han Solo]] in the first film of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, so [[George Lucas]] offered the role to [[Harrison Ford]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/burt-reynolds.html|title= Burt Reynolds Biography |publisher= [[The Biography Channel]] |accessdate = May 15, 2014}}</ref> Reynolds starred in the popular film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' alongside [[Jerry Reed]], [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Sally Field]]. Reynolds later claimed the turning point of his career was making ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' (1983). After voicing Charlie B. Barkin in the animated fantasy film, ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]'' (1989), he played a sex-obsessed congressman David Dilbeck in ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' (1996), which was a box-office success, though generally panned by critics. According to Reynolds, his performance was inspired by politicians he met through his father, who had been a police chief. He played Jack Horner in ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997) and won another Golden Globe Award. He played [[Boss Hogg]] in a film remake of the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (2005)<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377818/fullcredits#cast The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) - Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{better source|date=December 2012}}</ref> and Nate Scarborough in a remake of ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', with [[Adam Sandler]], who played the role of Paul "Wrecking" Crewe like him.

Best Buddies Canada is a national charitable organization dedicated to fostering friendships between students and individuals with intellectual disabilities. Reynolds is receiving its annual award for his decades-long "commitment to aiding and inspiring youth by supporting drama education and humanitarian causes", said the group. Such causes include the Burt Reynolds Institute for Theatre in Tequest, Florida, founded by the legendary actor in 1979. Donations by the star have also helped establish the Burt Reynolds Eminent Scholar Chair in Regional and Professional Theatre at the Florida State University, and the [[Asolo Repertory Theatre]] in Sarasota, Florida Reynolds has already been honoured for his efforts in aiding the children of Chernobyl.</ref>
