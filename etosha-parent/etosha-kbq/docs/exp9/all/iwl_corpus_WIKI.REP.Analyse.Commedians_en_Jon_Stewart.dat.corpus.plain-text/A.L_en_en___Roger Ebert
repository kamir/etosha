'''Roger Joseph Ebert''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|b|ər|t}}; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American [[film criticism|film critic]], journalist, and screenwriter. He was a film critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' from 1967 until his death in 2013.<ref name="site">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com |title=RogerEbert.com |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> In 1975, Ebert was the first film critic to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]].<ref name="Salt Lake Tribune death" /> As of 2010, his reviews were [[print syndication|syndicated]] to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad. Ebert also published more than 20 books and dozens of collections of reviews.

Ebert and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' critic [[Gene Siskel]] helped popularize nationally-televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the [[PBS]] show ''[[Sneak Previews]]'', followed by several variously-named ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies]]'' programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase "Two Thumbs Up," used when both hosts gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with [[Richard Roeper]].

In 2005, Ebert became the first film critic to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="Salt Lake Tribune death">{{cite news|last=Rousseau|first=Caryn|title=Roger Ebert, first movie critic to win Pulitzer, dies at 70|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56107300-223/ebert-movie-siskel-chicago.html.csp|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=April 4, 2013}}</ref> [[Neil Steinberg]] of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' said Ebert "was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic",<ref name=SunTimesObit /> Tom Van Riper of ''[[Forbes]]'' described him as "the most powerful pundit in America",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/09/21/pundit-americas-top-oped-cx_tvr_0924pundits.html|title=The Top Pundits in America|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=December 9, 2008|author=Riper, Tom Van|date=September 24, 2007|work=Forbes}}</ref> and [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called him "the best-known film critic in America".<ref name="LA Times death Turan">{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Remembrance: Roger Ebert, film's hero to the end|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-roger-ebert-appreciation-20130405,0,669989.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 4, 2013}}</ref>

Ebert lived with cancer of the [[Papillary thyroid cancer|thyroid]] and [[salivary gland cancer|salivary glands]] from 2002 that required treatments necessitating the removal of his lower jaw, which cost him the ability to speak or eat normally. Regardless, his ability to write was unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013.<ref name=SunTimesObit />

Regarding his early influences in film criticism, Ebert wrote in the 1998 parody collection ''Mad About the Movies'':
:I learned to be a movie critic by reading ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine... ''Mad'''s parodies made me aware of the machine inside the skin&nbsp;– of the way a movie might look original on the outside, while inside it was just recycling the same old dumb formulas. I did not read the magazine, I plundered it for clues to the universe. [[Pauline Kael]] lost it at the movies; I lost it at ''Mad'' magazine.<ref>Foreword to ''Mad About the Movies'', Mad Books, 1998, ISBN 1-56389-459-9</ref>

Ebert began taking classes at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] as an early-entrance student, completing his high-school courses while also taking his first university class.<ref>Ebert, Roger. Life Itself: A Memoir. New York: Grand Central Publishing, 2011. p. 91.</ref> After graduating from Urbana High School in 1960, Ebert then attended and received his undergraduate degree in 1964. While at the University of Illinois, Ebert worked as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Illini]]'' and then served as its editor during his senior year while also continuing to work as a reporter for the ''News-Gazette'' of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois (he had begun at the ''News-Gazette'' at age 15 covering Urbana High School sports).<ref>Ebert, Roger.

Ebert spent a semester as a master's student in the department of English there before attending the [[University of Cape Town]] on a Rotary fellowship for a year.<ref>Ebert, Roger. ''Life Itself: A Memoir''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, 2011. p.96.</ref> He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the [[University of Chicago]], he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the ''Chicago Daily News'', hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the ''Daily News'', including an article on the death of writer [[Brendan Behan]], he would be hired by editor [[Herman Kogan]]. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the ''Chicago Sun-Times,'' [[James F. Hoge, Jr.|Jim Hoge]], who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the ''Sun-Times'' in 1966.<ref>Ebert, Roger. ''Life Itself: A Memoir''.

==Career==

Ebert began his career as a film critic in 1967, writing for the ''Chicago Sun-Times''. He also met film critic [[Pauline Kael]] for the first time at the New York Film Festival in 1967. After he sent her some of his columns, she told him they were "the best film criticism being done in American newspapers today".<ref name=ChicagoMag /> That same year, Ebert's first book, a history of the [[University of Illinois]] titled ''Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life'', was published by the University's press. In 1969, his review of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 Ebert's review of ''Night of the Living Dead''] January 5, 1967</ref> was published in ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for the 1970 [[Russ Meyer]] film ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' and sometimes joked about being responsible for the film, which was poorly received on its release but is now regarded as a [[cult classic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19700101/REVIEWS/708110301/1023 |title=Beyond the Valley of the Dolls|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com date=1980|author=Ebert, Roger|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Ebert and Meyer also made ''[[Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens]]'', ''[[Up! (1976 film)|Up!]]'', and other films, and were involved in the ill-fated [[Sex Pistols]] movie ''[[Who Killed Bambi? (1978 film)|Who Killed Bambi?]]'' (In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of ''Who Killed Bambi?'' aka ''Anarchy in the UK'' on his blog.)<ref>[http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/who_killed_bambi_-_a_screenpla.html Ebert, Roger. "'Who Killed Bambi?'&nbsp;– A screenplay"], ''Chicago Sun-Times, April 25, 2010</ref>

From the 1970s on, Ebert worked for the [[University of Chicago]] as a guest lecturer, teaching a night class on film. For example, his fall 2005 class was on the work of the German director [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert by Roger Ebert.jpg|thumb|left|Roger Ebert (right) with [[Russ Meyer]] in 1970.]]
In 1975, Ebert began co-hosting a weekly film review television show, ''Sneak Previews'', which was locally produced by the Chicago [[public broadcasting]] station [[WTTW]]. Three years later, [[Gene Siskel]] became a co-host when the show was picked up by [[PBS]] for national distribution. The duo became famous for their "thumbs up/thumbs down" review summaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20129634,00.html|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|title=Despite the Loss of Film-Critic Buddy Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert Gives Life a Thumbs-Up|newspaper=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|date= November 1, 1999}}</ref> Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase "Two Thumbs Up".<ref name=Statement />

In 1982, they moved from PBS to launch a similar [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] commercial television show named ''[[At the Movies (1982–90 TV series)|At The Movies With Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert]]''. In 1986, they again moved the show to new ownership, creating ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel & Ebert & The Movies]]'' through [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]], part of [[the Walt Disney Company]].{{IMDb title|id=0090523|title=Siskel & Ebert (TV Series 1986 - 2010)}}

After Siskel's death in 1999, the producers retitled the show ''Roger Ebert & the Movies'' and used rotating co-hosts. In September 2000, ''Chicago Sun-Times'' columnist [[Richard Roeper]] became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At The Movies With Ebert & Roeper]]'' and later At the Movies.

Ebert ended his association with the Disney-owned ''At The Movies'' in July 2008,<ref name=Statement>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/22arts-EBERTANDROEP_BRF.html|title=Ebert and Roeper No Longer at the Movies |publisher=New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=Aug 30, 2013}}</ref> after the studio indicated it wished to take the program in a new direction. On February 18, 2009, Ebert reported that he and Roeper would soon announce a new movie-review program,<ref name=NewShow>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN|title=Roger Ebert.

On January 31, 2009, Ebert was made an honorary life member of the [[Directors Guild of America]].<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081217/film_nm/us_ebert "Directors Guild to honor Roger Ebert" [[Yahoo!

===Critical style===
Ebert described his critical approach to films as "relative, not absolute"; he reviewed a film for what he felt it would be to its prospective audience, yet always with at least some consideration as to its value as a whole. He awarded four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest, unless he considered the film to be "artistically inept" or "morally repugnant", in which case it received no stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/201010315/1023|title='&#39;Death Wish II'&#39; review by Roger Ebert|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

<blockquote>When you ask a friend if ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'' is any good, you're not asking if it's any good compared to ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'', you're asking if it's any good compared to ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]''. And my answer would be, on a scale of one to four, if ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' is four, then ''Hellboy'' is three and ''The Punisher'' is two. In the same way, if ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' gets four stars, then ''[[The United States of Leland]]'' clocks in at about two.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040423/REVIEWS/404230305/1023 Ebert's review of ''Shaolin Soccer''] (April 23, 2004)</ref></blockquote>

Ebert emphasized that his star ratings had little meaning if not considered in the context of the review itself. Occasionally (as in his review of ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]''), Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged such cases, stating, "I cannot recommend the movie, but … why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, ''that'' would be a reason".<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060330/REVIEWS/60323008 Ebert's review of ''Basic Instinct 2''] (March 21, 2006)</ref> In August 2004 [[Stephen King]], in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve.<ref>[[King, Stephen]], [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,681657,00.html "The Four-Star Follies"], August 20, 2004. Retrieved January 31, 2008.</ref> In his review of ''[[The Manson Family (film)|The Manson Family]]'', Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation ''per se''. He similarly gave the [[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|Adam Sandler-starring remake]] of ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the [[Cannes Film Festival]], he recommended readers not see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050526/REVIEWS/50510003/1023 |title=Ebert's review of '&#39;The Longest Yard'&#39; (2005 version) at rogerebert.com; May 27, 2005 |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> He declined to give a star rating to ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede]]'', arguing that the rating system was "unsuited" to such a film: "Is the movie good?

Ebert reprinted his starred reviews in movie guides. In his appearances on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', he was frequently challenged to defend his ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception&nbsp;– when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' three and a half stars. Ebert later added ''The Godfather Part II'' to his "Great Movies" list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his "worthlessness" but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review.<ref name="ebertgm">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Godfather, Part II review|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=October 2, 2008|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/REVIEWS08/810020300/1023|accessdate=February 28, 2010 }}</ref> When reviewing the [[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|2009 remake of ''The Last House on the Left'']], Ebert noted how he had given the [[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|controversial 1972 original]] three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: "I wrote that original "Last House" review 37 years ago.

Ebert occasionally accused some films of having an unwholesome political agenda, and the word "fascist" accompanied more than one of Ebert's reviews of the law-and-order films of the 1970s such as ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge against such films as ''[[The Night Porter]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750210/REVIEWS/502100301/1023|title=Ebert's review of ''The Night Porter''|date=February 10, 1975|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

Ebert's reviews could clash with the overall reception of movies, as evidenced by his one-star review of the celebrated 1986 [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' ("marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots … in a way, [director Lynch's] behavior is more sadistic than the [[Dennis Hopper|Hopper]] character").<ref>{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| title = Review of ''Blue Velvet''| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860919/REVIEWS/609190301/1023|accessdate= September 4, 2009| work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> He was dismissive of the popular 1988 [[Bruce Willis]] action film ''[[Die Hard]]'' ("inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot"),<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Review of ''Die Hard''|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880715/REVIEWS/807150301/1023|accessdate=September 4, 2009|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> while his positive 3 out of 4 stars review of 1997's ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]'' ("Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure")<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Review of ''Speed 2: Cruise Control'' |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970627/REVIEWS/706270305/1023

Ebert was also an advocate and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming to the defense of the cast and crew of [[Justin Lin]]'s ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'' (2001) during a [[Sundance Film Festival]] screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans.

Ebert was accused by some [[horror movie]] fans of elitism in his dismissal of what he calls "Dead Teenager Movies". Ebert clarified that he did not disparage horror movies as a whole, but that he drew a distinction between films like ''[[Nosferatu]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', which he regarded as "masterpieces", and films which he felt consisted of nothing more than groups of teenagers being killed off with the exception of one survivor to populate a sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605083630/http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/egebertsax2007.html|author=Gurnow, Michael|title=Roger Ebert's Bloody Ax: An Examination of the Film Critic's Elitist Dismissal of the Horror Film|publisher=The Horror Review|year=2007|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

Ebert revisited and sometimes revised his opinions. After ranking ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' third on his 1982 list, it was the only movie from that year to appear on his later "Best Films of the 1980s" list (where it also ranked third). He made similar revaluations of 1981's ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and 1985's ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. ''[[The Three Colors trilogy]]'' (''[[Three Colors: Blue|Blue]]'', ''[[Three Colors: White|White]]'', and ''[[Three Colors: Red|Red]]''), and ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' originally ranked second and third on Ebert's 1994 list; both were included on his "Best Films of the 1990s" list, but their order had reversed.<ref>[http://www.innermind.com/misc/s_e_top.htm "Siskel and Ebert Top Ten Lists (1969–1998)"]. innermind.com.

Ebert was an admirer of director [[Werner Herzog]], whom he supported through many years when Herzog's popularity had declined. He conducted an onstage public "conversation" with Herzog at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in 2004, after a screening of Herzog's film ''[[Invincible (2001 drama film)|Invincible]]'' at the Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival.

In 2005, Ebert opined that video games are not art, and are inferior to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, "video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful", but "the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art".<ref>Ebert, Roger (November 27, 2005).

In a July 1, 2010, blog entry, Ebert maintained his position that video games can never be art in principle, but conceded that he should not have expressed this skepticism without being more familiar with the actual experience of playing them. He reflected on the reaction to his blog entry, gamers' attempts to recommend to him games such as ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', and his reluctance to play games due to his lack of interest in the medium. Ebert did say that he enjoyed playing ''[[Cosmology of Kyoto]]''.<ref>Ebert, Roger (July 1, 2010). [http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html Roger Ebert.

===Legacy===
Ebert was an outspoken opponent of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]], repeatedly criticizing its decisions regarding which movies are suitable for children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703766704576009343432436296.html |title=Getting Real About Movie Ratings|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=December 11, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

Ebert also frequently lamented that cinemas outside major cities are "booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes", making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.<ref>Ebert, Roger (January 29, 2004). {{Wayback |date=20040604184449 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/oscars/ebert27.html |title="They got it right"}}. ''Chicago Sun-Times''.</ref>

Ebert was a strong advocate for [[Maxivision]] 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060219/ANSWERMAN/602190302/1023 |title=Ebert's "Movie Answer Man column", February&nbsp;19, 2006|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref> Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of [[3D film|3D effects in film]], which he found unrealistic and distracting.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/08/dminus_for_3d.html|title=D-minus for 3-D|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]: Blogs|date=August 16, 2008|accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

===Film and TV appearances===
In 1995, Ebert, along with colleague Gene Siskel, guest-starred on an episode of the animated TV series ''[[The Critic]]''. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/the-critic/siskel-and-ebert-and-jay-and-alice/episode/53022/summary.html TV.com] Episode summary: ''The Critic''&nbsp;– "Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice"</ref> The following year, Ebert appeared in ''Pitch'', a documentary by Canadian film makers [[Spencer Rice]] and [[Kenny Hotz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125459/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm |title=Pitch (1997) Full cast & crew |publisher=IMDb}}</ref>
