'''Caryn Elaine Johnson''' (born November 13, 1955),<ref>One [http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/whoopi-goldberg], source indicates she was born in 1949], but provides no supporting reference</ref> better known by her stage name '''Whoopi Goldberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|wh|ʊ|p|i}}), is an American comedian, actress, political activist, writer, producer, television host and singer. Although Goldberg made her film debut in the avant-garde [[ensemble film]] ''[[Citizen: I'm Not Losing My Mind, I'm Giving It Away]]'' (1982), her [[breakthrough role]] was playing Celie, a mistreated black woman in the [[Deep South]] in the [[period drama]] film ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985). For her performance, she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

She played Oda Mae Brown{{spaced ndash}} a wacky [[psychic]] helping a slain man ([[Patrick Swayze]]) save his lover ([[Demi Moore]]){{spaced ndash}} in the [[romantic fantasy]] film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' (1990), for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Goldberg was the second black woman in the history of the Academy Awards to win an acting Oscar (the first being [[Hattie McDaniel]], who won for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' in 1939). She was co-producer of the television game show ''[[Hollywood Squares#1998–2004|Hollywood Squares]]'' from 1998 to 2004. She has been the moderator of the daytime television talk show ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' since 2007. Goldberg has been nominated for 13 [[Emmy Award]]s for her work in television.  She is one of the [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|few entertainers]] who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award.

Her stage name, Whoopi, was taken from a [[whoopee cushion]]; she has stated that "If you get a little gassy, you've got to let it go. So people used to say to me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from."<ref>{{cite news|author=Solomon, Deborah|authorlink=Deborah Solomon|title=Making Nice|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/magazine/20wwln_q4.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 2006|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Whoopi+Goldberg+with+Lisa+Yapp%22&search_type=|title=Whoopi Goldberg with Lisa Yapp|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref> Whoopi's mother thought that a Jewish surname would get her further in Hollywood, so she replaced Johnson with [[Goldberg (surname)|Goldberg]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

According to an anecdote told by [[Nichelle Nichols]] in the documentary film ''[[Trekkies (film)|Trekkies]]'' (1997), a young Goldberg was watching ''[[Star Trek TOS|Star Trek]]'', and upon seeing Nichols' character [[Uhura]], exclaimed, "Momma! There's a black lady on TV and she ain't no maid!"<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Nichelle Nichols|Nichols, Nichelle]]|title=Trekkies|medium=DVD|publisher=Neo Motion Pictures |date=1997}}</ref> This spawned lifelong fandom of ''Star Trek'' for Goldberg, who would eventually ask for and receive a recurring guest-starring role on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.

Between the years of 1979 and 1981, she lived in [[East Germany]], working in a number of theater productions. During her travels, she would smuggle various items into the country for the artists she stayed with.<ref>{{cite web |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=5maGpPv6F94 |title=Maher, Hitchens Goldberg on Communism, Socialism and Capitalism |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early work===
Goldberg trained under acting teacher [[Uta Hagen]] at the [[HB Studio]] in New York City. She first appeared onscreen in 1981–82 in ''[[Citizen: I'm Not Losing My Mind, I'm Giving It Away (film)|Citizen: I'm Not Losing My Mind, I'm Giving It Away]]'', an avant-garde ensemble feature by San Francisco filmmaker [[William Farley (director)|William Farley]]. Goldberg created ''The Spook Show'', a one-woman show composed of different character monologues, in 1983. Director [[Mike Nichols]] offered to take the show to Broadway. The self-titled show ran from October 24, 1984 to March 10, 1985, for a total of 156 performances. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

While on Broadway, Goldberg's performance caught the eye of director [[Steven Spielberg]]. He was about to direct the film ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', based on the novel by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Alice Walker]], and offered her a leading role. ''The Color Purple'' was released in late 1985 and was a critical and commercial success. It was later nominated for 11 [[Academy Award]]s, including a nomination for Goldberg as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oscar.go.com/oscar-history/year/1986 |title=Oscar History 1986.}}</ref>

===A comedic and dramatic balance===
[[File:Whoopi Goldberg Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldberg at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Goldberg starred in [[Penny Marshall]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Jumpin' Jack Flash (film)|Jumpin' Jack Flash]]'', and began a relationship with David Claessen, a director of photography on the set; the couple married later that year. The film was a success, and during the next two years, three additional motion pictures featured Goldberg: ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]'', ''[[Fatal Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Telephone (film)|The Telephone]]''. Though these were not as successful as her prior motion pictures, Goldberg still garnered awards from the [[NAACP Image Award]]s. Claessen and Goldberg divorced after the box office failure of ''The Telephone'', which Goldberg was under contract to star in. She tried to sue the producers of the film, to no avail. The 1988 movie ''[[Clara's Heart]]'' was critically acclaimed, and featured a young [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. As the 1980s concluded, she participated in the numerous HBO specials of ''[[Comic Relief USA|Comic Relief]]'' with fellow comedians [[Robin Williams]] and [[Billy Crystal]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In January 1990, Goldberg starred with [[Jean Stapleton]] in the situation comedy ''[[Bagdad Cafe (TV series)|Bagdad Cafe]]''. The show ran for two seasons on [[CBS]]. Simultaneously, Goldberg starred in ''[[The Long Walk Home]]'', portraying a woman in the [[civil rights movement]]. She played a psychic in the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and became the first black woman to win the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in nearly 50 years, and only the second black woman in Oscar history to win an acting award (the first being [[Hattie McDaniel]], for 1939's ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''). ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'' named her character, Oda Mae Brown, in its list of Top 100 best film characters of all time.<ref>{{cite news|author= Borgeson, Kelly ''et al.''|title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time|url=http://www.premiere.com/features/1539/the-100-greatest-movie-characters-of-all-time-page12.html|work=Premiere|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref>

Goldberg starred in ''[[Soapdish]]'' and had a recurring role on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' as [[Guinan (Star Trek character)|Guinan]], which she would reprise in two ''Star Trek'' movies. On May 29, 1992, ''[[Sister Act]]'' was released. The motion picture grossed well over US$200 million and Goldberg was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. Next, she starred in ''[[Sarafina! (film)|Sarafina!]]''. During the next year, she hosted a late-night talk show, ''[[The Whoopi Goldberg Show]]'', and starred in two more motion pictures: ''[[Made in America (1993 film)|Made in America]]'' and ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]''. From 1994 to 1995, Goldberg appeared in ''[[Corrina, Corrina (film)|Corrina, Corrina]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'' (voice), ''[[The Pagemaster]]'' (voice), ''[[Boys on the Side]]'' and ''Moonlight and Valentino''. Goldberg guest starred on ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' in 1996. She became the first African-American woman to host the [[66th Academy Awards|Academy Awards show in 1994]], and the first woman to solo host. She hosted the awards show again in 1996, 1999 and 2002. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Goldberg starred in four motion pictures in 1996: ''[[Bogus (film)|Bogus]]'' (with [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Haley Joel Osment]]), ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]'', ''[[The Associate]]'' (with [[Dianne Wiest]]) and ''[[Ghosts of Mississippi]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[James Woods]]). During the filming of ''Eddie'', Goldberg began dating co-star [[Frank Langella]], a relationship which lasted until early 2000. In October 1997, Goldberg and ghostwriter Daniel Paisner cowrote ''Book'', a collection featuring insights and opinions.<ref>[http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000018950,00.html Paisner] at Penguin web site</ref>{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} In November and December 2005, Goldberg revived her one-woman show on Broadway at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] in honor of its 20th anniversary.

From 1998 to 2001, Goldberg took supporting roles in ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' with [[Angela Bassett]], ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' with [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Angelina Jolie]], ''[[Kingdom Come (2001 film)|Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (2001 film)|Rat Race]]'' with an all-star ensemble cast. She starred in the  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV versions of ''[[Cinderella (1997 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[A Knight in Camelot]]'', and the TNT Original Movie ''[[Call Me Claus]]''. In 1998, she gained a new audience when she became the "Center Square" on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', hosted by [[Tom Bergeron]]. She also served as executive producer, for which she was nominated for four [[Emmy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/whoopi-goldberg |title=Whoopi Goldberg Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref> She left the show in 2002, and the "Center Square" was filled in with celebrities for the last two on-air seasons without Goldberg. Most recently, she had a cameo role as [[Megan Fox]]'s boss in the 2014 reboot of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], and played herself in [[Chris Rock]]'s [[Top Five]].

[[File:Whoopi Comic Relief cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldberg at [[Comic Relief]] in 2006]]
In 2003, Goldberg returned to television, starring in the NBC comedy ''[[Whoopi]]'', which was canceled after one season. On her 46th birthday, Goldberg was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Goldberg also appeared alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Angela Bassett]] in the HBO documentary ''[[Unchained Memories]]'' (2003), narrating slave narratives. During the next two years she became a spokeswoman for [[Slim Fast]] and produced two television sitcoms: Lifetime's original drama ''[[Strong Medicine]]'' that ran for six seasons and ''Whoopi's Littleburg'', a [[Nickelodeon]] show for younger children. Goldberg made guest appearances on ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'' as an elderly character named Louise Clarkson. She produced the [[Noggin (TV channel)|Noggin]] sitcom ''[[Just for Kicks (TV series)|Just for Kicks]]'' in early 2006. She was a guest at [[Elton John]]'s 60th birthday bash and concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] on March 25, 2007. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

On September 4, 2007, Goldberg became the new moderator and co-host of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', replacing [[Rosie O'Donnell]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Whoopi Goldberg joins 'The View'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/01/view.whoopi/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular|publisher=CNN|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307185632/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/01/view.whoopi/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular|archivedate=March 7, 2008}}</ref> She stated on her official blog that she wanted Goldberg to be moderator. Goldberg's debut as moderator drew 3.4 million viewers, 1 million fewer than O'Donnell's debut ratings. After two weeks, however, ''The View'' was averaging 3.5 million total viewers under Goldberg, a 7% increase from 3.3 million under O'Donnell the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|author=Learmonth, Michael|title=Whoopi-led View on topshow tops Rosie's ratings|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972516.html?categoryid=1275&cs=1|work=Variety|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref>

On more than one occasion, Goldberg has expressed strong disagreement and irritation with different remarks made by [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]], such as on October 3, 2007, when Hasselbeck commented that [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]'s proposed US$5,000 baby entitlement might lead to fewer abortions because of women wanting to keep the money.<ref>{{cite news|title=Access Hollywood|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah6972.shtml|work=Access Hollywood|accessdate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080317202446/http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah6972.shtml|archivedate=March 17, 2008}}</ref>
