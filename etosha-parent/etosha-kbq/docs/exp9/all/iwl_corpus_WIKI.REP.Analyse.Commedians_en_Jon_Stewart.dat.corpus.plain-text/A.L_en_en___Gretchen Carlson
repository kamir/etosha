Carlson was moved to ''[[Fox & Friends]]'' initially as a weekend substitute host. But on September 25, 2006, a shifting of anchors, which included [[E.D. Hill]] moving to the 10 a.m. hour of ''[[Fox News Live]]'', opened a weekday slot on ''Fox & Friends'', which Carlson filled. She co-hosted with [[Steve Doocy]] and [[Brian Kilmeade]] for several years.

She announced on ''Fox & Friends'' on June 9, 2009 (also repeated on [[Glenn Beck]]'s Fox News program), that her parents' car dealership had been selected for closing as part of the [[General Motors]] reorganization and bankruptcy on June 1, 2009.<ref name="Levy06162009">{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/north/47970131.html?elr=KArks:DCiUMcyaL_nDaycUiacyKUnciaec8O7EyUr |title=GM terminates contract with Anoka’s Main Motors|last=Levy|first=Paul|date=June 16, 2009|work=StarTribune.com|publisher=The Star Tribune Company|accessdate=9 December 2009|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota}}</ref><ref name="Froemming06042009">{{Cite web|url=http://www.abcnewspapers.com/index.php?id=7661&task=view&option=com_content&Itemid=26|title=Anoka’s Main Motors being cut by GM|last=Froemming|first=Mandy Moran|date=June 4, 2009|work=Anoka County Union|publisher=ABCNewspapers.com|accessdate=9 December 2009|location=Coon Rapids, Minnesota}}</ref> A year later the Star Tribune reported that "It took an act of Congress, a national TV appeal and maybe a little bit of history on the owners' side, but Main Motor, the Anoka car dealership that Lee and Karen Carlson's family has owned for 91 years, will keep its General Motors dealership after all."<ref>Levy, Paul.

=="Hostile enemy" comment==
On ''Fox & Friends'', during a January 10, 2007, interview with [[Dan Bartlett]], counselor to then-president [[George W. Bush]], Carlson labeled [[Democratic Party United States|Democrat]]ic [[U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy]] a "hostile enemy" of the United States, "right here on the home front." Bartlett replied, "Well, we don't view Ted Kennedy as a hostile enemy. We do view him to be an open and often critic of the war. He has been from the very outset. I don't think that's anything new." [[Keith Olbermann]] chose her as that day's "Worst Person in the World" on that night's broadcast of his show ''Countdown'',<ref name=WorstPerson>{{cite web|title=Carlson Earns 'Worst Person' Award|url=http://www.newshounds.us/2007/01/11/carlson_earns_worst_person_award.php|website=News Hounds|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=11 January 2007}}</ref> while [[Howard Kurtz]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called it "the Fox News exchange of the day" and asked, "Doesn't the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] allow for dissent?"<ref>{{cite news |title=One Last Surge |author= |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/01/11/BL2007011100388_4.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |publisher=The Washington Post Company |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=4 & 5 |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |quote=The president's speech surprised me last night. |date=January 11, 2007}}</ref>
