'''Edward R. Murrow''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR-cats|KBEh}} (born '''Egbert Roscoe Murrow''';<ref>[http://ncpedia.org/biography/murrow-edward Edward R. Murrow<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> April 25, 1908 – April 27, 1965) was an American broadcast journalist. He first came to prominence with a series of radio news broadcasts during [[World War II]], which were followed by millions of listeners in the United States.

A pioneer of television news broadcasting, Murrow produced a series of reports that helped lead to the [[censure]] of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Fellow journalists [[Eric Sevareid]], [[Ed Bliss]], [[Bill Downs]], [[Dan Rather]], and [[Alexander Kendrick]] consider Murrow one of journalism's greatest figures, noting his honesty and integrity in delivering the news.

==Early life==
{{Journalism sidebar}}
Murrow was born Egbert Roscoe Murrow at Polecat Creek, near [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]],<ref name=Baker>Baker, Anne Pimlott (2004), [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47830 "Murrow, Edward Roscoe (1908–1965)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, accessed December 7, 2010</ref> in [[Guilford County, North Carolina]], the son of Roscoe C. Murrow and Ethel F. (née Lamb) Murrow. His parents were [[Quakers]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/01/28/famous.quakers/ |title= What Richard Nixon and James Dean had in common |accessdate=2008-01-31 |last=Hattikudur |first=Mangesh |date=January 28, 2008 |work= |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> He was the youngest of three brothers and was a "mixture of English, [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish and German" descent.<ref>{{cite news |title=Edward R.

Lacey was four years old and Dewey was two years old when Murrow was born.<ref name="Edward R 2004">''Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism.'' Edwards, B. 2004.</ref> His home was a log cabin without electricity or plumbing, on a farm bringing in only a few hundred dollars a year from corn and hay.

When Murrow was six years old, his family moved across the country to [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]] in [[Western Washington|western]] [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to [[Homestead principle|homestead]] near [[Blanchard, Washington|Blanchard]], {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} south of the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]]. He attended high school in nearby [[Edison, Washington|Edison]], and was president of the student body in his senior year and excelled on the debate team. He was also a member of the basketball team which won the Skagit County championship.

After graduation from high school in 1926, Murrow enrolled at [[Washington State University|Washington State College]] (now Washington State University) across the state in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], and eventually majored in speech. A member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]], he was also active in college politics. By his teen years, Murrow went by the nickname "Ed" and during his second year of college, he changed his name from Egbert to Edward. In 1929, while attending the annual convention of the [[National Student Federation of America]], Murrow gave a speech urging college students to become more interested in national and world affairs; this led to his election as president of the federation. After earning his bachelor's degree in 1930, he moved back east to New York.

Murrow was assistant director of the [[Institute of International Education]] from 1932 to 1935 and served as assistant secretary of the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]], which helped prominent German scholars who had been dismissed from academic positions. He married [[Janet Huntington Brewster]] on March 12, 1935. Their son, Charles Casey Murrow, was born in the west of London on November 6, 1945.

==Career at CBS==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
Murrow joined [[CBS]] as director of talks and education in 1935 and remained with the network for his entire career.<ref name=Baker /> CBS did not have news staff when Murrow joined, save for announcer [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]]. Murrow's job was to line up newsmakers who would appear on the network to talk about the issues of the day. But the onetime Washington State speech major was intrigued by Trout's on-air delivery, and Trout gave Murrow tips on how to communicate effectively on radio.

Murrow went to London in 1937 to serve as the director of CBS's European operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/Radio%20TV%20Mirror/Radio%20and%20Television%20Mirror%204010.pdf|title=They Also Serve|page=16|author=Rankin, Katherine|date=October 1940|work=Radio-TV Mirror|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> The position did not involve on-air reporting; his job was persuading European figures to broadcast over the CBS network, which was in direct competition with [[NBC]]'s two radio networks. Murrow recruited journalist [[William L. Shirer]] to take a similar post on [[Continental Europe|the continent]]. The two men would become the forefathers of broadcast journalism.

===Radio===
Murrow gained his first glimpse of fame during the March 1938 ''[[Anschluss]],'' in which [[Adolf Hitler]] engineered the [[annexation]] of [[Austria]] by [[Nazi Germany]]. While Murrow was in [[Poland]] arranging a broadcast of children's choruses, he got word from Shirer of the annexation—and the fact that Shirer could not get the story out through Austrian state radio facilities. Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London, where he delivered an uncensored, eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered a plane to fly from [[Warsaw]] to [[Vienna]], so he could take over for Shirer.

At the request of CBS New York (either chief executive [[William S. Paley]] or news director [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]]), Murrow and Shirer put together a ''[[CBS World News Roundup|European News Roundup]]'' of reaction to the Anschluss, which brought correspondents from various European cities together for a single broadcast. On March 13, 1938, the special was broadcast, hosted by Bob Trout in New York, including Shirer in London (with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] [[Ellen Wilkinson]]), reporter [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] of the ''Chicago Daily News'' in Paris, reporter [[Pierre J. Huss]] of the International News Service in [[Berlin]], and Senator [[Lewis B. Schwellenbach]] in Washington, D.C. Reporter Frank Gervasi, in Rome, was unable to find a transmitter to broadcast reaction from the Italian capital, but phoned his script to Shirer in London, who read it on the air.<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|116–120}} Murrow reported live from Vienna, in the first on-the-scene news report of his career: "This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna.... It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived."

The broadcast was considered revolutionary at the time. Featuring multipoint, live reports in the days before modern technology (and without each of the parties necessarily being able to hear one another), it came off almost flawlessly. The special became the basis for ''[[CBS World News Roundup|World News Roundup]]''—broadcasting's oldest news series, which still runs each weekday morning and evening on the [[CBS Radio Network]].

In September 1938, Murrow and Shirer were regular participants in CBS's coverage of the crisis over the [[Sudetenland]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], which Hitler coveted for Germany and eventually won in the [[Munich Agreement]]. Their incisive reporting heightened the American appetite for radio news, with listeners regularly waiting for Murrow's [[shortwave]] broadcasts, introduced by analyst [[H. V. Kaltenborn]] in New York saying, "Calling Ed Murrow ... come in Ed Murrow."

During the following year, leading up to the outbreak of [[World War II]], Murrow continued to be based in London. William Shirer's reporting from Berlin brought him national acclaim, and a commentator's position with CBS News upon his return to the United States in December 1940. (Shirer would describe his [[Berlin]] experiences in his best-selling book ''[[Berlin Diary]]''.) When the war broke out in September 1939, Murrow stayed in London, and later provided live radio broadcasts during the height of [[the Blitz]] in ''[[London After Dark]]''. These broadcasts electrified radio audiences as news programming never had: previous war coverage had mostly been provided by newspaper reports, along with [[newsreel]]s seen in movie theaters; earlier radio news programs had simply featured an announcer in a studio reading [[wire service]] reports.

==World War II==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
Murrow's reports, especially during the Blitz, began with what became his signature opening, "''This'' is London," delivered with his vocal emphasis on the word ''this'', followed by the hint of a pause before the rest of the phrase. His former speech teacher, [[Ida Lou Anderson]], suggested the opening as a more concise alternative to the one he had inherited from his predecessor at CBS Europe, Cesar Saerchinger: "Hello America. This is London calling." Murrow's phrase became synonymous with the newscaster and his network.<ref name="link">{{cite web| title=Edward R. Murrow graduates from Washington State College on June 2, 1930| url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=7526| author=Kit Oldham| date=26 October 2005| publisher=HistoryLink.org| accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>

Murrow achieved great celebrity status as a result of his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with "good night, and good luck." The future British monarch, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said "good night, and good luck to you all". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with "Good night, and good luck." Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.

When Murrow returned to the U.S. in 1941, CBS hosted a dinner in his honor on December 2 at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. 1,100 guests attended the dinner, which the network broadcast. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a welcome-back telegram, which was read at the dinner, and [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Archibald MacLeish]] gave an [[encomium]] that commented on the power and intimacy of Murrow's wartime dispatches.<ref name="sperber1998">{{cite book | title=Murrow, His Life and Times | publisher=Fordham University Press | author=Sperber, A. M. | year=1998 | isbn=0-8232-1881-3}}</ref>{{rp|203–204}}

The [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] occurred less than a week after this speech, and the U.S. entered the war as a combatant on the Allied side.

Murrow flew on 25 Allied combat missions in Europe during the war,<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|233}} providing additional reports from the planes as they droned on over Europe (recorded for delayed broadcast). Murrow's skill at improvising vivid descriptions of what was going on around or below him, derived in part from his college training in speech, aided the effectiveness of his radio broadcasts.

As hostilities expanded, Murrow expanded CBS News in London into what [[Harrison Salisbury]] described as "the finest news staff anybody had ever put together in Europe".<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|230}} The result was a group of reporters acclaimed for their intellect and descriptive power, including [[Eric Sevareid]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Howard K. Smith]], [[Mary Marvin Breckinridge]], [[Cecil Brown (journalist)|Cecil Brown]], [[Richard C. Hottelet]], [[Bill Downs]], [[Winston Burdett]], [[Charles Shaw (journalist)|Charles Shaw]], [[Ned Calmer]], and [[Larry LeSueur]]. Many of them, Shirer included, were later dubbed "[[Murrow's Boys]]"—despite Breckinridge being a woman.

Murrow so closely cooperated with the British that in 1943 [[Winston Churchill]] offered to make him joint [[director-general of the BBC]], in charge of programming. Although he declined the job, during the war Murrow did fall in love with Churchill's daughter-in-law, [[Pamela Harriman|Pamela]],<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|221–223,244}}<ref>{{cite book | title=Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign against American "Neutrality" in World War II | author=Cull, Nicholas John | year=1995 | pages=192 | isbn=0-19-508566-3}}</ref> whose other American lovers included [[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]], whom she married many years later. Pamela wanted Murrow to marry her, and he considered it; however, after his wife gave birth to their only child, Casey, he ended the affair.

After the war, Murrow recruited journalists such as [[Alexander Kendrick]], [[David Schoenbrun]], [[Daniel Schorr]]<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news

On April 12, 1945, Murrow and [[Bill Shadel]] were the first reporters at the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp in Germany. He met emaciated survivors including [[Petr Zenkl]], children with [[Identification in Nazi camps#Numbers|identification tattoos]], and "bodies stacked up like cordwood" in the crematorium. In his report three days later, Murrow said:<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|248–252}}

{{quote|I pray you to believe what I have said about Buchenwald. I have reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it I ''have'' no words....

==Postwar broadcasting career==
[[Image:Murrow and Truman.jpg|thumb|Edward R. Murrow and [[Harry S. Truman]], ''[[This I Believe]]'' series, 1951–1955]]

===Radio===
In December 1945 Murrow reluctantly accepted Paley's offer to become a Vice President of the network and head of CBS News, and made his last news report from London in March 1946.<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|259,261}} The relationship between Murrow and Shirer ended in 1947 in one of the great confrontations of American broadcast journalism, when Shirer was fired by CBS. He said he resigned in the heat of an interview at the time, but was actually terminated.<ref name=native>{{cite book|title=20th Century Journey: A Native's Return |publisher=Little Brown |year=1990 |author=William L. Shirer}}</ref> The dispute began when J.B. Williams, maker of shaving soap, withdrew its sponsorship of Shirer's Sunday news show. CBS, of which Murrow was then vice president for public affairs, decided to "move in a new direction," hired a new host, and let Shirer go. There are different versions of these events; Shirer's was not made public until 1990.

Shirer contended that the root of his troubles was the network and sponsor not standing by him because of his comments critical of the [[Truman Doctrine]], as well as other comments that were considered outside of the mainstream. Shirer and his supporters felt he was being muzzled because of his views. Meanwhile, Murrow, and even some of Murrow's Boys, felt that Shirer was coasting on his high reputation and not working hard enough to bolster his analyses with his own research.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Murrow and Shirer never regained their close friendship.

The episode hastened Murrow's desire to give up his network vice presidency and return to newscasting, and it foreshadowed his own problems to come with his friend Paley, boss of CBS.

Murrow and Paley had become close when the network chief himself joined the war effort, setting up [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] radio outlets in Italy and North Africa. After the war, he would often go to Paley directly to settle any problems he had. "Ed Murrow was Bill Paley's one genuine friend in CBS," noted Murrow biographer [[Joseph Persico]].

Murrow returned to the air in September 1947, taking over the nightly 7:45&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] newscast sponsored by [[Campbell's Soup]] and anchored by his old friend and announcing coach [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]]. (Trout left for NBC<!-- before or after this?--> but returned to CBS in 1952.)

In 1950, Murrow narrated a half-hour radio documentary called "The Case for the Flying Saucers". It offered a balanced look at [[unidentified flying object]]s, a subject of widespread interest at the time. Murrow interviewed both [[Kenneth Arnold]] (whose 1947 report kick-started interest in UFOs) and astronomer [[Donald Menzel]] (who argued that UFO reports could be explained as people misidentifying prosaic phenomena).<ref>[July 23, 2010 The documentary is available online.]</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

From 1951 to 1955, Murrow was the host of ''[[This I Believe]]'', which offered ordinary people the opportunity to speak for five minutes on radio.

Murrow continued to present daily radio news reports on the CBS Radio Network until 1959. He also recorded a series of narrated "historical albums" for [[Columbia Records]] called ''I Can Hear It Now'', which inaugurated his partnership with producer [[Fred W. Friendly]]. In 1950 the records evolved into a weekly CBS Radio show, ''[[Hear It Now]]'', hosted by Murrow and co-produced by Murrow and Friendly.

===Television and films===
As the 1950s began, Murrow began his television career by appearing in editorial "tailpieces" on the [[CBS Evening News]] and in the coverage of special events. This came despite his own misgivings about the new medium and its emphasis on pictures rather than ideas.

On November 18, 1951, ''Hear It Now'' moved to television and was re-christened ''[[See It Now]]''. After the pre-title sequence and introduction, viewers saw and heard host Murrow explain with a knowing smile, "This is an old team, trying to learn a new trade."<ref name="sperber1998"/>{{rp|354}}

In 1952, Murrow narrated the political documentary ''Alliance for Peace'', an information vehicle for the newly formed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] detailing the effects of the Marshall Plan upon a war-torn Europe. Written by [[William Templeton (screenwriter)|William Templeton]] and produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn, Jr.]]

In 1953, Murrow launched a second weekly TV show, a series of celebrity interviews entitled ''[[Person to Person]]''.

====Criticism of McCarthyism====
''See It Now'' focused on a number of controversial issues in the 1950s, but it is best remembered as the show that criticized [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]], contributing, if not leading, to the political downfall of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].

On March 9, 1954, Murrow, Friendly, and their news team produced a half-hour ''See It Now'' special titled "A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy".<ref name="seenow540309">{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/murrowmccarthy.html|title=A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy|work=[[See It Now]]|publisher=CBS|date=March 9, 1954|accessdate=November 23, 2008}}</ref> Murrow used excerpts from McCarthy's own speeches and proclamations to criticize the senator and point out episodes where he had contradicted himself. Murrow and Friendly paid for their own newspaper advertisement for the program; they were not allowed to use CBS's money for the publicity campaign or even use the CBS logo.

Nevertheless, the broadcast contributed to a nationwide backlash against McCarthy and is seen as a turning point in the history of television. It provoked tens of thousands of letters, telegrams, and phone calls to CBS headquarters, running 15 to 1 in favor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Val |title=PRAISE POURS IN ON MURROW SHOW |newspaper=New York Times |date=11 March 1954 |page=19 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05EEDE1738E23BBC4952DFB566838F649EDE }}</ref> In a retrospective produced for ''[[Biography (television program)|Biography]]'', Friendly noted how truck drivers pulled up to Murrow on the street in subsequent days and shouted "Good show, Ed. Good show, Ed."

Murrow offered McCarthy a chance to appear on ''See It Now'' to respond to the criticism. McCarthy accepted the invitation and made his appearance three weeks later,<ref name="seenow540406">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/josephmccarthycbsseeitnow.htm|title=Audio for "Reply to Edward R.

Murrow"], ''[[American Masters]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved March 28, 2008.</ref>

In the program following McCarthy's appearance, Murrow commented that the senator had "made no reference to any statements of fact that we made" and contested the personal attacks made by "the junior senator from [[Wisconsin]]" against himself.<ref name="seenow540413">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/edwardrmurrowtomccarthy.htm|title=Response to Senator Joe McCarthy|work=[[See It Now]]|publisher=CBS|date=April 13, 1954|accessdate=November 23, 2008}}</ref>

[[Image:Murrow57.jpg|thumb|Edward R. Murrow at work with CBS, 1957]]

====Later television career====
Murrow's hard-hitting approach to the news, however, cost him influence in the world of television. ''See It Now'' occasionally scored high ratings (usually when it was tackling a particularly controversial subject), but in general it did not score well on prime-time television.

When a [[quiz show]] phenomenon began and took TV by storm in the mid-1950s, Murrow realized the days of ''See It Now'' as a weekly show were numbered. (Biographer Joseph Persico notes that Murrow, watching an early episode of ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'' air just before his own ''[[See It Now]]'', is said to have turned to Friendly and asked how long they expected to keep their time slot).

''See It Now'' was knocked out of its weekly slot in 1955 after sponsor [[Alcoa]] withdrew its advertising, but the show remained as a series of occasional TV special news reports that defined television documentary news coverage. Despite the show's prestige, CBS had difficulty finding a regular sponsor, since it aired intermittently in its new time slot (Sunday afternoons at 5 p.m. ET by the end of 1956) and could not develop a regular audience.

In 1956, Murrow took time to appear as the on-screen narrator of a special prologue for [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s epic production, ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. Although the prologue was generally omitted on telecasts of the film, it was included in home video releases.

====Fall from favor====
Murrow's reporting brought him into repeated conflicts with CBS, especially its chairman [[William S. Paley|Bill Paley]], which Friendly summarized in his book ''Due to Circumstances Beyond our Control''. ''See It Now'' ended entirely in the summer of 1958 after a clash in Paley's office. Murrow had complained to Paley he could not continue doing the show if the network repeatedly provided (without consulting Murrow) equal time to subjects who felt wronged by the program.

According to Friendly, Murrow asked Paley if he was going to destroy ''See It Now'', into which the CBS chief executive had invested so much. Paley replied that he did not want a constant stomach ache every time Murrow covered a controversial subject.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Smith | first = Sally Bedell | authorlink = Sally Bedell Smith | title = In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley : The Legendary Tycoon and His Brilliant Circle | publisher = Simon & Schuster | date = November 1990 | isbn = 978-0-671-61735-6 }}</ref>

''See It Now'''s final broadcast, "Watch on the [[Ruhr]]" (covering postwar Germany), aired July 7, 1958. Three months later, on October 15, 1958, in a speech before the [[Radio Television Digital News Association|Radio and Television News Directors Association]] in Chicago, Murrow blasted TV's emphasis on entertainment and commercialism at the expense of [[public interest]] in his "wires and lights" speech:

{{cquote|During the daily peak viewing periods, television in the main insulates us from the realities of the world in which we live. If this state of affairs continues, we may alter an advertising slogan to read: ''Look now, pay later''.<ref name="rtnda58">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/content/edward_r_murrow_s_1958_wires_lights_in_a_box_speech#.VCl4tmddVWI|title=Edward R. Murrow Speech|publisher=Radio-Television News Directors Association|date=October 15, 1958|accessdate=November 23, 2008}}</ref>}}

The harsh tone of the Chicago speech seriously damaged Murrow's friendship with Paley, who felt Murrow was biting the hand that fed him. Before his death, Friendly said that the RTNDA address did more than the McCarthy show to break the relationship between the CBS boss and his most respected journalist.

After the end of ''See It Now,''  Murrow was invited by New York's Democratic Party to run for the Senate. Paley was enthusiastic and encouraged him to do it. Harry Truman advised Murrow that his choice was between being the junior senator from New York or being Edward R. Murrow, beloved broadcast journalist and hero to millions. He listened to Truman.<ref name="Edward R 2004"/>

Beginning in 1958, Murrow hosted a talk show entitled ''[[Small World (Talk show)|Small World]]'' that brought together political figures for one-to-one debates.  In January 1959, he appeared on [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s ''The Press and the People'' with [[Louis Lyons]], discussing the responsibilities of television journalism.<ref>[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:9e3aec4b58a32e284b755c6f2318f47b92db3d08 "Responsibilities Of Television, The; Part I"].

WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved November 9, 2010.</ref>

After contributing to the first episode of the documentary series ''CBS Reports'', Murrow, increasingly under physical stress due to his conflicts and frustration with CBS, took a sabbatical from summer 1959 to mid-1960, though he continued to work on ''CBS Reports'' and ''Small World'' during this period. Friendly, executive producer of ''CBS Reports'', wanted the network to allow Murrow to again be his co-producer after the sabbatical, but he was eventually turned down.

Murrow's last major TV milestone was reporting and narrating the ''CBS Reports'' installment "[[Harvest of Shame]]", a report on the plight of [[Migrant workers|migrant farm workers]] in the United States. Directed by Friendly and produced by David Lowe, it ran in November 1960, just after [[Thanksgiving]].

Murrow portrayed himself in the British film production of ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' in 1960, recreating some of the wartime broadcasts he did from London for CBS.<ref name="bismark">{{IMDb title|0054310|Sink the Bismarck!}}</ref>

Murrow resigned from CBS to accept a position as head of the [[United States Information Agency]], parent of the [[Voice of America]], in January 1961. President [[John F. Kennedy]] offered Murrow the position, which he viewed as "a timely gift". CBS president [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] had reportedly been offered the job but declined, suggesting that Murrow be offered the job.

On September 16, 1962, Murrow introduced educational television to New York City via the maiden broadcast of WNDT, which became [[WNET]].

[[Image:Murrow challengeofideas desk.jpg|thumb|Murrow, now [[United States Information Agency|USIA]] director, appears in a 1961 Cold War propaganda film.]]

Murrow's appointment as head of the [[United States Information Agency]] was seen as a vote of confidence in the agency, which provided the official views of the government to the public in other nations. The USIA had been under fire during the McCarthy era, and Murrow brought back at least one of McCarthy's targets, [[Reed Harris]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Reed Harris Dies.

Joseph McCarthy. |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/125587462.html |quote=Reed Harris, 72, a writer, publisher, and former State Department official who was driven from government for a time after a highly publicized confrontation with the late Sen.

However, the early effects of cancer kept him from taking an active role in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] planning. He did advise the president during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] but was ill at the time the president was assassinated. Murrow was drawn into Vietnam because the USIA was assigned to convince reporters in Saigon that the government of Ngo Dinh Diem embodied the hopes and dreams of the Vietnamese people. Murrow knew the Diem government did no such thing.<ref>Edwards, Bob. Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004. Print.</ref> Asked to stay on by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], Murrow did so but resigned in early 1964, citing illness. Before his departure, his last recommendation was of [[Barry Zorthian]] to be chief spokesman for the U.S. government in [[Saigon]], Vietnam.<ref name="FT01">{{cite news| author=Jurek Martin| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5915b0f0-201b-11e0-a6fb-00144feab49a.html#axzz1BVSm2Get| title=US spokesman who fronted Saigon’s theatre of war| work=[[Financial Times]]| date=15 January 2011| publisher=ft.com| accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>

Murrow's celebrity gave the agency a higher profile, which may have helped it earn more funds from Congress.{{ref}} His transfer to a governmental position – Murrow was a member of the [[National Security Council]], a position for life – led to an embarrassing incident shortly after taking the job; he asked the [[BBC]] not to show his documentary ''[[Harvest of Shame]]'', in order to not damage the European view of the USA, however the BBC refused as it had bought the programme in good faith.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0425.html</ref> British newspapers delighted in the irony of the situation, with one ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' writer saying: "if Murrow builds up America as skillfully as he tore it to pieces last night, the propaganda war is as good as won".<ref>http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS316/mbase/docs/harvest.html</ref>

According to some biographers,{{Who|date=December 2012}} near the end of Murrow's life, when health problems forced him to resign from the USIA, Paley reportedly invited Murrow to return to CBS. Murrow, possibly knowing he could not work, declined Paley's offer.

==Death==
A [[chain smoker]] throughout his life, Murrow was almost never seen without his trademark [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]] cigarette. It was reported that he smoked between sixty and sixty-five cigarettes a day, equivalent to roughly three packs.<ref>{{cite book|title=The broadcast century and beyond|author=Robert L.

He developed lung cancer and lived for two years after an operation to remove his left lung.

Murrow died at his home on April 27, 1965, two days after his 57th birthday.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', April 28, 1965, p. 60.</ref> His colleague and friend [[Eric Sevareid]] said of him, "He was a shooting star; and we will live in his afterglow a very long time." CBS carried a memorial program, which included a rare on-camera appearance by Paley.

==Legacy==
After Murrow's death, the Edward R. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy was established at [[Tufts University|Tufts University's]] [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]]. Murrow's library and selected artifacts are housed in the Murrow Memorial Reading Room that also serves as a special seminar classroom and meeting room for Fletcher activities. Murrow's papers are available for research at the [http://dca.tufts.edu Digital Collections and Archives] at Tufts, which has a [https://wikis.uit.tufts.edu/confluence/display/MurrowCollection/Home website] for the collection and makes many of the digitized papers available through the [[Tufts Digital Library]].

The center awards Murrow [[Fellow#Graduate school fellowships|fellowships]] to mid-career professionals who engage in research at Fletcher, ranging from the impact of the "new world information order" debate in the international media during the 1970s and 1980s to, currently, [[telecommunications]] policies and regulation. Many distinguished journalists, diplomats, and policymakers have spent time at the center, among them the late [[David Halberstam]], who worked on his [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning book, ''[[The Best and the Brightest]]'', as a writer-in-residence in the early 1970s. Veteran journalist [[Crocker Snow, Jr.]] was named director of the Murrow Center in 2005.

In 1971 the RTNDA established the [[RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award|Edward R. Murrow Award]], honoring outstanding achievement in the field of electronic journalism. There are four other awards also known as the "[[Edward R. Murrow Award (disambiguation)|Edward R. Murrow Award]]," including [[Edward R. Murrow Award (WSU)|the one]] at Washington State University.

In 1973, Murrow's alma mater, [[Washington State University]], dedicated its expanded communication facilities the Edward R. Murrow Communications Center and established the annual Edward R. Murrow Symposium.<ref name="wsu1">{{cite web| url=http://communication.wsu.edu/overview/history/history2.htm| title=Murrow College History 1973–1980| publisher=Washington State University| author=Ryan Thomas| accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> In 1990, the WSU Department of Communications became the Edward R.

Several movies were filmed, either completely or partly about Murrow. 1986, [[HBO]] broadcast the made-for-cable biographical movie, ''[[Murrow (film)|Murrow]]'', with [[Daniel J. Travanti]] in the title role, and [[Robert Vaughn]] in a supporting role. In the 1999 film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', [[Lowell Bergman]], a television producer for the CBS news magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'', played by [[Al Pacino]], is confronted by [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]], played by [[Christopher Plummer]], after an exposé of the tobacco industry is edited down to suit CBS management and then, itself, gets exposed in the press for the self-censorship. Wallace passes Bergman an editorial printed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which accuses CBS of betraying the legacy of Edward R. Murrow. ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' is a 2005 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated film directed, co-starring and co-written by [[George Clooney]] about the conflict between Murrow and [[Joseph McCarthy]] on ''See It Now''. Murrow is portrayed by actor [[David Strathairn]], who received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination. In the film, Murrow's conflict with CBS boss Bill Paley occurs immediately after his skirmish with McCarthy.
