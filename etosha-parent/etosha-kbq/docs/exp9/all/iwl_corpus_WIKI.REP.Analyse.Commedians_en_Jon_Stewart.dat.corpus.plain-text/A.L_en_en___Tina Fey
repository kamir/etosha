She is best known for her work on the [[NBC]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (1998–2006), the critically acclaimed NBC comedy series ''[[30 Rock]]'' (2006–2013), and films such as ''[[Mean Girls]]'' (2004), ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'' (2008), ''[[Date Night]]'' (2010), and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (2014).

Fey broke into comedy as a featured player in the Chicago-based [[improvisational theatre|improvisational comedy]] group [[The Second City]]. She then joined ''SNL'' as a writer, later becoming [[head writer]] and a performer, known for her position as co-anchor in the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment. In 2004, she co-starred in and wrote the screenplay for ''[[Mean Girls]],'' which was [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from the 2002 self-help book ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]''.  After leaving ''SNL'' in 2006, she created the television series ''[[30 Rock]]'' for [[Broadway Video]], a situation comedy loosely based on her experiences at ''SNL''. In the series, Fey portrays the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy series. In 2008, she starred in the comedy film ''Baby Mama'', alongside former ''SNL'' co-star [[Amy Poehler]]. Fey next appeared in the 2010 comedy film ''[[Date Night]]'' and the animated film ''[[Megamind]]''. In 2015, she created and produced the television series ''[[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]]'' for [[NBC]], although it was eventually moved to [[Netflix]].

Fey has received eight [[Emmy Awards]], two [[Golden Globe Awards]], five [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and four [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], and has been nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for her autobiographical book ''[[Bossypants]]'', which topped the [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] for five weeks.
