'''George Robert''' "'''Bob'''" '''Newhart''' (born September 5, 1929) is an American [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and [[actor]]. Noted for his [[deadpan]] and slightly [[stammering]] delivery, Newhart came to prominence in the 1960s when his album of comedic [[monologues]] ''[[The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart]]'' was a worldwide bestseller and reached number one on the ''Billboard'' pop album chart—it remains the 20th best-selling comedy album in history.<ref>Manilla, Ben. "[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17561805 'Button-Down Mind' Changed Modern Comedy]", 2007-10-23.</ref> The follow-up album, ''The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!'' was also a massive success, and the two albums held the ''Billboard'' number one and number two spots simultaneously.<ref name="autobio" />

Newhart later went into acting, starring in two long-running and award-winning situation comedies, first as psychologist Dr. Robert "Bob" Hartley on the [[1970s in television|1970s]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' and then as innkeeper Dick Loudon on the [[1980s in television|1980s]] sitcom ''[[Newhart]]''. He also had two short-lived sitcoms in the nineties titled ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]'' and ''[[George and Leo]]''. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]] in ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' and Papa Elf in ''[[Elf (movie)|Elf]]''. He provided the voice of Bernard in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] animated films ''[[The Rescuers|The Rescuers (1977)]]'' and ''[[The Rescuers Down Under|The Rescuers Down Under (1990)]]''. In 2004 he played the library head [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Judson (Bob Newhart)|Judson]] in ''[[The Librarian (franchise)|The Librarian]]'', a character which continued in 2014 to the TV series ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]''. In 2011, Newhart made a cameo in the film ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'', and in 2013 he guest starred in three episodes of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', for one of which he won his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] on September 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Newhart finally gets his Emmy Award|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/bob-newhart-finally-gets-his-emmy-award/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>

On February 20, 2015, Newhart was honored with the Publicists of the International Cinematographers Guild Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saval|first1=Malina|title=Publicists Guild Celebrates Life and Career of Bob Newhart|url=http://variety.com/2015/biz/awards/publicists-guild-celebrates-life-and-career-of-bob-newhart-1201436361/|website=variety.com|publisher=Variety Media / Penske Business Media|accessdate=February 28, 2015|date=February 19, 2015|quote=After 55 years of standup, albums and TV shows, the comedian continues to entertain}}</ref>

==Early life==
Newhart was born and raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], [[Illinois]]. His parents were Julia Pauline (''née'' Burns; 1900–1993), a housewife, and George David Newhart (1900–1985), a part-owner of a plumbing and heating-supply business. His mother was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his father had Irish, [[German people|German]] and [[English people|English]] ancestry.<ref name=autobio/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/richardson.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Richardson |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref> One of his grandmothers was from [[St. Catharines]], Ontario,  [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Misunderstanding Thorold, feeling good about St. Catharines |author= Herod, Doug |url= http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2211240 |newspaper= St Catharines Standard |date= December 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> Newhart has three sisters, Virginia, Mary Joan (a nun, who taught at the all-girls Carmel High School in [[Mundelein, Illinois]]) and Pauline.

Newhart was educated at Roman Catholic schools in the Chicago area, including St. Catherine of Siena grammar school in Oak Park, and attended [[St. Ignatius College Prep]] (high school), graduating in 1947. He then enrolled at [[Loyola University of Chicago]] from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in business management.

Newhart was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and served in the United States during the [[Korean War]] as a personnel manager until being discharged in 1954. Newhart briefly attended [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]] but did not complete a degree, in part, he says, because he was asked to behave unethically during an internship.<ref name=autobio/>

==Career==
After the war, Newhart got a job as an accountant for [[USG Corporation|United States Gypsum]]. He later said that his motto, "That's close enough", and his habit of adjusting petty cash imbalances with his own money shows he did not have the temperament to be an accountant.<ref name=autobio/> He also said he was a clerk in the unemployment office who made $55 a week, but who quit upon learning unemployment benefits were $45 a week and he "only had to come in to the office one day a week to collect it."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html American Masters . Bob Newhart | PBS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Comedy albums===
In 1958, Newhart became an advertising [[copywriter]] for Fred A. Niles, a major independent film and television producer in [[Chicago]].<ref name="MargaretMick2011">{{cite book | author1=Margaret Hicks | author2=Mick Napier | title=Chicago Comedy: A Fairly Serious History | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8GB83XHjwh0C&pg=PA66 | accessdate=24 November 2012 | date=2 May 2011 | publisher=The History Press | isbn=978-1-60949-211-3 | page=66}}</ref> It was here that he and a co-worker would entertain each other with long telephone calls about absurd scenarios, which they would later record and send to radio stations as audition tapes. When his co-worker ended his participation, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing the [[shtick]] which was to serve him well for decades. In addition to his various stand-up bits, he incorporated that shtick into his television series at appropriate times. The auditions led to his first recording contract. A disc jockey at a radio station - Dan Sorkin, who later became the announcer-sidekick on his NBC series — introduced Newhart to the head of talent at [[Warner Bros. Records]], which signed him in 1959—only a year after the label was formed—based solely on those recordings. He expanded his material into a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up routine]] which he began to perform at nightclubs.<ref name=autobio/>

Newhart became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he became the world's first solo "[[double act|straight man]]". This is a seeming contradiction in terms: by definition, a straight man is the counterpart to a more loony comedic partner. Newhart's routine, however, was simply to portray one end of a conversation (usually a phone call), playing the straightest of comedic straight men and implying what the other person was saying. Newhart told a 2005 interviewer for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[American Masters]]'' that his favorite stand-up routine is "Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue", in which a slick promoter has to deal with the reluctance of the eccentric President to agree to efforts to boost his image. The routine was suggested to Newhart by Chicago TV director and future comedian [[Bill Daily]], who would be Newhart's castmate on the 1970s ''The Bob Newhart Show'' for CBS. Newhart became known for using an intentional stammer, in service to his unique combination of politeness and disbelief at what he was supposedly hearing. Newhart has used the delivery throughout his career. In his 2006 book ''I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This,'' he included the following anecdote:
{{quotation|When I was doing ''The Bob Newhart Show,'' one of the producers pulled me aside and said that the shows were running a little long. He wondered if I could cut down the time of my speeches by reducing my stammering. 'No, that stammer bought me a house in Beverly Hills.'<ref>{{cite web|last=Newhart |first=Bob |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6111083 |title=Bob Newhart, 'I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This' |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>}}

His 1960 comedy album, ''[[The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart]]'', went straight to number one on the charts, beating [[Elvis Presley]] and the cast album of ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. It was the first comedy album to make #1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts.<ref name=parade>{{cite news | title = In Step With: Bob Newhart | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = July 17, 2005 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_07-17-2005/in_step_with_0 }}</ref> ''Button Down Mind'' received the [[Grammy Awards of 1961|1961 Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

Subsequent comedy albums include ''Behind the Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart'' (1961), ''The Button-Down Mind on TV'' (1962), ''Bob Newhart Faces Bob Newhart'' (1964), ''The Windmills Are Weakening'' (1965), ''This Is It'' (1967), ''Best of Bob Newhart'' (1971), and ''Very Funny Bob Newhart'' (1973). Years later he released ''Bob Newhart Off the Record'' (1992), ''The Button-Down Concert'' (1997) and ''Something Like This'' (2001), an anthology of his 1960s Warner Bros. albums.

===Television===
Newhart's success in stand-up led to his own [[NBC]] [[variety show]] in 1961, ''[[The Bob Newhart Show (1961 TV series)|The Bob Newhart Show]]''. The show lasted only a single season, but earned Newhart a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination and a [[Peabody Award]]. The Peabody Board cited him as:
{{quotation|... a person whose gentle satire and wry and irreverent wit waft a breath of fresh and bracing air through the stale and stuffy electronic corridors. A merry marauder, who looks less like St. George than a choirboy, Newhart has wounded, if not slain, many of the dragons that stalk our society. In a troubled and apprehensive world, Newhart has proved once again that laughter is the best medicine.}}

In the mid-1960s, Newhart appeared on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' 24 times, and on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' eight times.<ref name=autobio/> He appeared in a [[1963 in television|1963 episode]] of ''[[List of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes|The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'', "How to Get Rid of Your Wife", and on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. Newhart guest-hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' 87 times, and hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice, 15 years apart (1980 and 1995).

In addition to stand-up comedy, Newhart became a dedicated character actor. That led to other series such as: ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[Captain Nice]]'', 2 episodes of ''Insight'', and ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]''. He reprised his role as Dr. Bob Hartley on ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' and appeared as himself on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and as a retired forensic pathologist on ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''.

Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', for which he was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]],<ref name=autobio/> as well as on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' (see below in "Other appearances") and a role on ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as [[Ducky Mallard|Ducky]]'s mentor and predecessor who, it was discovered, had [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. In 2013 he also appeared on ''[[Committed (2005 TV series)|Committed]]'' and appeared in an episode of the sixth season of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', for which he was awarded a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], and subsequent episodes of its seventh season.<ref>{{cite web|title='The Big Bang Theory' Season 6: Bob Newhart to Play Professor Proton - TVLine|url=http://tvline.com/2013/03/21/the-big-bang-theory-season-6-cast-bob-newhart-professor-proton/|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>

===Films===
Primarily a television star, Newhart has been in a number of popular films, beginning with the 1962 war story ''[[Hell Is for Heroes (film)|Hell Is for Heroes]]'' starring [[Steve McQueen]]. His films have ranged from 1970's [[Alan Jay Lerner]] musical ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', the 1971 [[Norman Lear]] comedy ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', the [[Mike Nichols]]-directed war satire ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch 22]]'', the Walt Disney animated feature ''[[The Rescuers]]'' in 1977 along with its sequel ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' in 1990, to the 2003 [[Will Ferrell]] holiday comedy ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]''.

Newhart played the President of the United States in a 1980 comedy, ''[[First Family (film)|First Family]]''. He appeared as a beleaguered school principal in 1997's ''[[In & Out]]'', starring [[Kevin Kline]].

In 2011 he made a cameo appearance as a sadistic, but appreciative CEO at the end of the film ''[[Horrible Bosses]]''.

==Sitcoms==

===''The Bob Newhart Show''===
[[File:Newhart show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|195px|right|Standing, from left: Howard Borden, Carol Kester, Jerry Robinson. Seated: Bob and Emily Hartley]]
Newhart's most notable exposure on television came from two long-running programs that centered on him. In 1972, soon after Newhart guest-starred on [[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]], he was approached by his agent and his managers, producer [[Grant Tinker]] and actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]] (the husband/wife team who founded [[MTM Enterprises]]), to work on a pilot series called ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', to be written by Davis and Music. He was very interested in the starring role of dry psychologist Bob Hartley, with [[Suzanne Pleshette]] playing his wry loving wife, Emily, and [[Bill Daily]] as neighbor and friend Howard Borden.

''The Bob Newhart Show'' faced heavy competition from the beginning, launching at the same time as the popular shows ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[Sanford And Son]]'', and ''[[The Waltons]]''. Nevertheless, it was an immediate hit. The show eventually referenced what made Newhart's name in the first place. Apart from the first few episodes, it used an opening-credits sequence featuring Newhart answering a telephone in his office. According to co-star [[Marcia Wallace]], the entire cast got along well, and Newhart became close friends with both Wallace and co-star Suzanne Pleshette.

The cast also included unfamiliar actors: Marcia Wallace as Bob's wisecracking, man-chasing receptionist, Carol Kester; [[Peter Bonerz]] as orthodontist Jerry Robinson, whose offices were on the same floor as Newhart's Hartley; [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] as Elliot Carlin, the most misanthropic among members of Dr. Hartley's most frequently seen group therapy sessions; legendary character actor and voice artist, [[John Fiedler]] (the voice of [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]]); [[Florida Friebus]] (once the mother on ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'') as another group member; and, scattered over two seasons, [[Pat Finley]] as Hartley's sister, Ellen, a love interest for Howard Borden. Future ''Newhart'' regular [[Tom Poston]] had a briefly recurring role as Cliff Murdock; veteran stage actor [[Barnard Hughes]] appeared as Hartley's father for three episodes spread over two seasons, and studio film veteran [[Martha Scott]] appeared in several episodes as Hartley's mother. Actress [[Teri Garr]] appeared twice in the 1973-74 season.

By 1977, the show was suffering lackluster ratings and Newhart wanted to end it, but was under contract to do one more season. The show's writers tried to rework the sitcom by adding a pregnancy, but Newhart objected: "I told the creators I didn't want any children, because I didn't want it to be a show about 'How stupid Daddy is, but we love him so much, let's get him out of the trouble he's gotten himself into'." Nevertheless, the staff wrote an episode that they hoped would change Newhart's mind. Newhart read the script and he agreed it was very funny. He then asked, "Who are you going to get to play Bob?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/newhart1.htm |title=The Bob Newhart Show &#124; A Television Heaven Review |publisher=Televisionheaven.co.uk |date=1929-09-05 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> Coincidentally, Newhart's wife gave birth to their daughter Jenny late in the year, which caused him to miss several episodes.

In the last episode of the fifth season, not only was Bob's wife, Emily, pregnant, but his receptionist, Carol, too. In the first show of the sixth season, Bob revealed his dream of the pregnancies and that neither Emily nor Carol were really pregnant.

Marcia Wallace spoke of Newhart's amiable nature on set: "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I had a dog that I used to bring to the set by the name of Maggie. And whenever there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, who invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!"

Newhart finally discontinued the sitcom in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, ''[[Newhart]]'', Wallace said, "But some of the other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, ''[[George & Leo]]'', in 1997.

===''Newhart''===
[[File:Bob Newhart crop.jpg|thumb|left|Newhart at the 1987 Emmy Awards]]
By 1982, Newhart was interested in a new [[sitcom]]. After he had discussions with [[Barry Kemp (TV producer)|Barry Kemp]] and [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], the show ''[[Newhart]]'' was created, in which Newhart played [[Vermont]] innkeeper Dick Loudon. Actress [[Mary Frann]] was cast as his wife, Joanna Loudon.  Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after the first season, and another unfamiliar [[prime-time]] actress and soap star (who had been a fan of Newhart's since she was 21), [[Julia Duffy]] joined the cast as Dick's inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen. A familiar actor (who had been a fan of Newhart's since he was 17), [[Peter Scolari]] was also cast as Dick's [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons. Well known actor [[Tom Poston]] played the role of handyman George Utley on "Newhart" and received three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for his role in "Newhart" as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, 1984, 1986 and 1987. Like ''The Bob Newhart Show'', ''Newhart'' was an immediate hit, and like the show before it, it was also nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habits finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary polycythemia. The doctors ordered him to stop smoking.

In 1987, ratings began to drop. ''Newhart'' ended in 1990 after eight seasons and 182 episodes. The last episode ended with a scene in which Newhart wakes up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette, who had played Emily, his wife from ''The Bob Newhart Show''. He realizes (in a satire of a famous plot element in the television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' a few years earlier) that the entire eight-year ''Newhart'' series had been a single nightmare of Dr. Bob Hartley's, provoked by "eating too much Japanese food before going to bed." Recalling Mary Frann's buxom figure, Bob closes the segment and the series by telling Emily, "You really should wear more sweaters" before the typical closing notes of the old ''Bob Newhart Show'' theme played over the fadeout. The twist ending was later chosen by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as the best finale in television history.

===Other TV series===
[[File:Bob Newhart, 1991.jpg|thumb|right|About 1991, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] ]]
In 1992, Newhart returned to television with a series called ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]'', about a [[cartoonist]]. An ensemble cast included a pre-''[[Friends]]'' [[Lisa Kudrow]], but the show did not develop a strong audience and was canceled shortly after the start of its second season, despite good critical reviews. (On ''The Tonight Show'' following the cancellation, Newhart famously {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} joked he had now done shows called ''The Bob Newhart Show'', ''Newhart'' and ''Bob'' so his next show was going to be called ''The''.)

In 1997, Newhart returned again with ''[[George and Leo]]'' on [[CBS]] with [[Judd Hirsch]] and [[Jason Bateman]]; the show was canceled during its first season.

In 1995, a 65-year-old Newhart was approached by the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network to do his very first comedy special in his 35-year career. His special ''Off The Record'' consisted of him doing material from his first and second albums in front of a live audience in Pasadena, California. In 2003, Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' in a rare dramatic role that earned him an [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination, his first in nearly 20 years. In 2005, he began a recurring role in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Morty, the on-again/off-again boyfriend of Sophie ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]), Susan Mayer's ([[Teri Hatcher]]) mother. In 2009, he received another [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for reprising his role as Judson in ''[[The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice]]''.

On August 27, 2006, at the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]], hosted by [[Conan O'Brien]], Newhart was placed in a supposedly airtight glass prison that contained three hours of air. If the Emmys went over the time of three hours, he would die. This gag was an acknowledgment of the common frustration that award shows usually run on past their allotted time (which is usually three hours). Newhart "survived" his containment to help O'Brien present the award for Outstanding Comedy Series (which went to ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'').

During an episode of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', Newhart made a comedic cameo with members of ABC's show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' lampooning an alternate ending to the series finale. In 2011, Newhart appeared in a small but pivotal role as a doctor in Lifetime's anthology film on breast cancer ''Five''. And, in 2013, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Big Bang Theory]] ''as the aged Professor Proton (Arthur Jeffries), a former science TV show host turned children's party entertainer, for which he won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]], his first Emmy Award.<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/bob-newhart Bob Newhart | Television Academy]. Emmys.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref>

On December 19, 2014, Newhart made a surprise appearance on the final episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' where he was revealed to be the person inside Secretariat, Ferguson's on-set pantomime horse. The show then ended with a scene parodying the ''[[Newhart]]'' series finale, with Ferguson and [[Drew Carey]] reprising their roles from ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.

Newhart is known for his [[deadpan]] delivery and a slight [[Stuttering|stammer]] which he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career.<ref name=autobio/> On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the [[Jack Benny]] tradition of being the "straight man" while the sometimes somewhat bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs.

Several of his routines involve hearing one half of a conversation as he speaks to someone over the phone. In a bit called ''King Kong'', a rookie security guard at the [[Empire State Building]] seeks guidance as to how to deal with an ape who is "18 to 19 stories high, depending on whether we have a [[Thirteenth floor|13th floor]] or not". He assures his boss he has looked in the guards manual "under 'ape' and 'ape's toes'". Other famous routines include "The Driving Instructor", "The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (and Storm Door Company)", "Introducing Tobacco to Civilization", "Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue", "Defusing a Bomb" (in which an uneasy security division commander tries to walk a new and nervous security guard through defusing a live shell discovered on a California beach), "The Retirement Party", "A Neighbour's Dog", "Ledge Psychology", and "The Khrushchev Landing Rehearsal."

In a 2012 podcast interview with [[Marc Maron]], comedian [[Shelley Berman]] accused Newhart of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style, describing it as a "very special technique that couldn't really be imitated. It could be stolen. And it was." When asked by Maron if it was done maliciously, Berman replied, "Maliciously? He wouldn't do it maliciously. Nobody does that. But he did it to make a living. And he became a star." Berman later added, "I thought it was a rotten thing to do. I thought the agents who sold him - I thought they were just as guilty as everybody else. But, my God, to go into a town and do my show, and the critics saying that I borrowed some stuff from Newhart..."<ref>[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_332_-_shelley_berman 2012 Marc Maron interview, occurs at around 39 minutes & 56 minutes] - [http://traffic.libsyn.com/wtfpod/WTF_-_EPISODE_332_SHELLEY_BERMAN.mp3 WTF_-_EPISODE_332_SHELLEY_BERMAN.mp3]</ref>

In interviews, Newhart has never taken credit for originating the telephone concept, which he has noted was done earlier by Berman and [[Nichols and May]], and earlier than that by [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] in his well-known sketch "Hello Mama", and even earlier in the 1913 recording "[[Cohen on the Telephone]]"; and would later be done by [[Lily Tomlin]] as well.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martel|first=Ned|title=For Bob Newhart, Dean of Deadpan, the Laughs Go On|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/arts/television/12bob.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 12, 2005}}</ref><ref>Thorn, Jesse.

==Writings==
On September 20, 2006, Hyperion Books released Newhart's first book, ''I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This''. The book is primarily a memoir, but features comic bits by Newhart as well. Transcripts of many of Newhart's classic routines are woven in with the rest of the text. As actor [[David Hyde Pierce]] notes, "The only difference between Bob Newhart on stage and Bob Newhart offstage &ndash; is that there is no stage."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-newhart19sep19,1,1987080.story?coll=la-entnews-tv | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Matthew | last=DeBord | date=September 19, 2006 | title=Bob Newhart is cool.

==Personal life==
Newhart was introduced by [[Buddy Hackett]] to Virginia "Ginnie" Quinn, the daughter of character actor [[Bill Quinn]].<ref name=autobio/> They were married on January 12, 1963. The couple have four children (Robert, Timothy, Jennifer and Courtney), and several grandchildren. They are Roman Catholic and raised their children as such, but Ginnie said they did not want them to have "the fears" that came from their upbringing.<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/people/pn/Bob_Newhart.html From: Jeff Sorensen, Bob Newhart, St. Martin's Press: New York (1988) via adherents.com]</ref> He is a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in [[Beverly Hills, California]].<ref>[http://www.goodshepherdbh.org/a-city-on-a-hill/our-history/ Church of the Good Shepherd: Our History]</ref>

In 1985, Newhart was rushed to the emergency room, suffering with secondary [[polycythemia]], after years of heavy smoking. He made a recovery, several weeks after, and has since quit smoking.<ref name=autobio/>
