In 2006, Wilmore began appearing regularly on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'', where he was billed as the "Senior Black Correspondent" or a derivative form of the title, such as the "Senior Executive Commander-in-Chief Who Happens To Be Black Correspondent" following the election of [[Barack Obama]].<ref name="lee"/> His work on the show frequently centered on humorous observations of the Black experience in American society.<ref name="bashir"/><ref name="lee"/> In January 2009, [[Disney Hyperion|Hyperion]] published Wilmore's ''I'd Rather We Got Casinos: And Other Black Thoughts'', a political humor book described by [[Booklist]] as "a faux collection of articles, essays, radio transcripts, and letters exploring the more ludicrous angles on race." Wilmore originated the titular phrase ''I'd Rather We Got Casinos'' in a January 2007 ''Daily Show'' appearance.<ref>{{cite video |title= Black History Month |date= January 31, 2007 |publisher= ''The Daily Show''.

I'd rather we got casinos. |url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-january-31-2007/black-history-month }}</ref>

Wilmore has continued to make occasional acting appearances, including a role as a minister in ''[[I Love You, Man]]'' ([[2009 in film|2009]]) and a supporting role in ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]'' ([[2010 in film|2010]]).

In 2011, Wilmore began a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'', where he played Mr. Forristal, Brad's ([[Damon Wayans, Jr.]]) uptight boss.

As of 2012, Wilmore starred in the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] special titled ''Race, Religion and Sex'' that was shot in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Part stand-up show, part town-hall meeting, the special was the basis for a possible series that would take place in different cities.
