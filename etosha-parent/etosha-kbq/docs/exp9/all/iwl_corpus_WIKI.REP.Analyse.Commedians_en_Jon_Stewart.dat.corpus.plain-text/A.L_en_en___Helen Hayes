'''Helen Hayes MacArthur''' (October 10, 1900 &ndash; March 17, 1993) was an American actress whose career spanned almost 80 years. She eventually garnered the nickname "First Lady of the American Theatre" and was one of twelve people [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award (an EGOT)]]. Hayes also received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], America's highest civilian honor, from [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in 1986.<ref>Reagan, Ronald.[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=37238&st=medal&st1=freedom "Ronald Reagan: Remarks at the Presentation Ceremony for the Presidential Medal of Freedom - May 12, 1986"] presidency.ucsb.edu, May 12, 1986, accessed August 27, 2011</ref> 

In 1988, she was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].  The annual [[Helen Hayes Awards]], which have recognized excellence in professional theatre in the greater Washington, D.C. area since 1984, are her namesake.  In 1955 the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

==Early life==
Helen Hayes was born in [[Washington D.C.]] on October 10, 1900. Her mother, Catherine Estelle ([[married and maiden names|née]] Hayes), or Essie, was an aspiring actress who worked in touring companies.<ref>[http://www.helenhayes.com/about/bio.htm "The Official Website of Helen Hayes: Biography"] Helen Hayes.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref><ref name="hayes1">[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&entitY_id=3739&source_type=A "Biography of Helen Hayes"] Kennedy-Center.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref> Her father, Francis van Arnum Brown, worked at a number of jobs, including as a clerk at the Washington Patent Office and as a manager and salesman for a wholesale butcher.<ref name="hayes1"/><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848403-1,00.html "The Theatre:Helen Millennial"] ''Time Magazine'', December 30, 1935.</ref> Hayes' [[Irish Catholic]] maternal grandparents emigrated from [[Ireland]] during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]].<ref>Rice, Jean.[http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/IrelandGenWeb/2003-02/1044131835 "Helen Hayes (1900-1993),The First Lady [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF123DF93BA25750C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 "Helen Hayes, Flower of the Stage, Dies at 92"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), March 18, 1993</ref>

Hayes began a stage career at an early age. She said her stage debut was as a 5-year-old singer at Washington's Belasco Theatre (on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.)<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[http://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Evely+%22On+This+Spot:+Pinpointing+the+Past+in+Washington+%22&source=bl&ots=lrRgMc5EwO&sig=ozOjnbFbH7AHwbceLxEiftb4JGQ&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22&f=false "The White House Neighborhood"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.'' (2008), Capital Books, ISBN 1-933102-70-5, p.166</ref> By the age of ten, she had made a short film called ''Jean and the Calico Doll'', but moved to [[Hollywood]] only when her husband, playwright [[Charles MacArthur]], signed a Hollywood deal. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes "Helen Hayes"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>

==Career==
[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|left|200px|thumb|In the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]
Her sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Myrna Loy]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with actor [[Gary Cooper]], whom Hayes admitted to finding extremely attractive), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise from her Broadway hit) and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]''. However, Hayes did not prefer that medium to the stage.

Hayes eventually returned to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in the [[Gilbert Miller]] production of ''Victoria Regina'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].

In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly [[stowaway]] in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback—she had suspended her career for several years due to the death of her daughter Mary, and her husband's failing health.

In 1955 the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. However, business interests in the 1980s wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. To accomplish razing this theatre and three others, as well as the [[Hotel Astor]], the business interests received Hayes' consent to raze the theatre named for her, even though she had no ownership interest in the buildings. Parts of the original Helen Hayes theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[The Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper Westside of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. "Dickens lends the Bard a Hand," ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed The [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014 the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as The Playhouse Market a quaint restaurant and Gourmet Deli.

It is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the "First Lady of the Theatre".  Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]] also held that title, and each thought that the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html "The Theatre: Great Katharine"]''Time Magazine'', April 3, 1939</ref> One critic said that Cornell played every Queen as though she were a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman as though she were a Queen.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In 1982, with friend [[Lady Bird Johnson]], she founded the National Wildflower Research Center, now the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ "About Us, History"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>

The [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington D.C. area is named in her honor. She has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6220 Hollywood Blvd. Helen Hayes is also a member of the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterhalloffame.org/members.html#H|title=Members of the American Theater Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Hayes was a [[Catholic]]<ref>Hayes, Helen. ''My Life in Three Acts''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: San Diego, CA, 1990, p.unknown</ref><ref>Hevesi, Dennis. "Helen Hayes Is Remembered in Church She Loved", ''The New York Times'', March 21, 1993, p.45</ref> and a pro-business Republican who attended many [[Republican National Conventions]] (including the one held in New Orleans in 1988), but she was not as politically vocal as some others (e.g., [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[John Wayne]], [[Ronald Reagan]] etc.) in the Hollywood community of that time.

Hayes wrote three memoirs: ''A Gift of Joy'', ''On Reflection'' and ''My Life in Three Acts''. Some of the themes in these books include her return to [[Roman Catholicism]] (she had been denied communion from the Church for the length of her marriage to MacArthur, who was a [[divorce]]d [[Protestant]]); and the death of her only daughter, Mary, who was an aspiring actress, from [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]], went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television.  (Hayes herself guest starred on a 1975 episode of ''Hawaii Five-0'', playing the aunt of MacArthur's character.)

Hayes was hospitalized a number of times for her [[asthma]] condition, which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from legitimate theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. "Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust," ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/oscar/article-9039658 "Helen Hayes Biography"] britannica.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>

Her last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]]. [[Clive Barnes]] wrote "She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting...She is one of those actors...where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing."<ref>Barnes, Clive. "Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|left|thumb|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.|272x272px]]
Hayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. "Dickens lends the Bard a Hand," ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.

In 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 returned to the New York stage in a benefit reading for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with the late [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. "Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref>  The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before.  The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating the performance.

==Helen Hayes Hospital==

According to her daughter-in-law, [[HB Macarthur]], Hayes took the most pride, however, in her philanthropic work with Helen Hayes Rehabilitation Hospital located in [[West Haverstraw, NY]] She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities.

Hayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital and successfully led a fight to prevent the relocation of the facility to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in the successful lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.

Hayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading the race by riding in a classic car and handing out awards to runners, handcyclists and wheelchair racers, and generously offering the use of her home Pretty Penny for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.

==Death==
Hayes died on [[St. Patrick's Day]],1993 from [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. [[Lillian Gish]] had designated Hayes as beneficiary of her estate, but Hayes survived her by less than a month. Hayes was interred in the Oak Hill Cemetery, Nyack, New York.<ref name=pace>Pace, Eric.[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF123DF93BA25750C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 "Helen Hayes, Flower of the Stage, Dies at 92"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), March 18, 1993</ref> In 2011, she was honored with a US postage stamp.<ref>[http://www.beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes "Helen Hayes Postage Stamp"] beyondtheperf.com, April 25, 2011, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>
