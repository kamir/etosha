'''Lorne Michaels''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born '''Lorne Lipowitz'''; November 17, 1944)<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitor|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 18, 2011|issue=1181|page=34}}</ref> is a Canadian-American<ref name=filmr>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/57/Lorne-Michaels.html |title=Lorne Michaels Biography (1944–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' series (since 1993), and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' (since 2014).

==Early life==
Michaels was born in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, the son of Florence (Becker) and Henry Abraham Lipowitz, a furrier.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shriver|first=Ryan|title=Lorne Michaels|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548262/Lorne-Michaels/biography|accessdate=April 25, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/57/Lorne-Michaels.html|title=Lorne Michaels Biography (1944-)|work=filmreference.com}}</ref> He was the eldest of the Lipowitz children. He has a sister, Barbara Lipowitz, who currently resides in Toronto, and a brother, Mark Lipowitz, who died from a brain tumor. Michaels attended the [[Forest Hill Collegiate Institute]] in Toronto and graduated from [[University College, University of Toronto]], where he majored in English, in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548262/Lorne-Michaels/biography |title=Lorne Michaels |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' }}</ref> Michaels began his career as a writer and broadcaster for [[CBC Radio]].<ref name="ggbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.bce.ca/ggawards/en/p_michaels_l.html |title=2006 Governor General's Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement |publisher=Bce.ca |date= |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> He moved to Los Angeles from Toronto in 1968 to work as a writer for ''[[Laugh-In]]'' and ''[[Phyllis Diller|The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show]]''. He starred with [[Hart Pomerantz]] in ''[[The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour]]'', a Canadian comedy series which ran briefly in the early 1970s. During the late 1960s, Michaels married [[Rosie Shuster]], who later worked with him on ''Saturday Night Live'' as a writer.<ref>{{cite web|author=HelloStuart User Score 13 , Last Online 8 hrs, 50 mins ago |url=http://www.tv.com/rosie-shuster/person/13663/summary.html |title=Rosie Shuster |publisher=TV.com |date=June 19, 1950 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> She was the daughter of [[Frank Shuster]], one half of the famous comedy team, [[Wayne and Shuster]]. Michaels and Shuster were divorced in 1980.

==''Saturday Night Live''==
In 1975 Michaels created (with fellow NBC employee [[Dick Ebersol]] and president of the network Herb Schlosser) the TV show ''NBC's Saturday Night'', which in 1977 changed its name to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''  (initially there was a name conflict with an ABC show titled "Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell" which debuted 9/20/75 and was cancelled on 11/26/75).  The show, which is performed live in front of a studio audience, immediately established a reputation for being cutting-edge and unpredictable. It became a vehicle for launching the careers of some of the most successful comedians in the United States.

Originally the producer of the show, Michaels was also a writer and later became executive producer. He occasionally appears on-screen as well, where he is known for his [[deadpan]] humor. Throughout the show's history, ''SNL'' has been nominated for more than 156 [[Emmy Award]]s and has won 36. It has consistently been one of the highest-rated late-night television programs. Michaels has been with ''SNL'' for all seasons except for his hiatus in the early 1980s (seasons 6–10).

His daughter, Sophie, has appeared in episodes, one of which was during the show's 30th season hosted by [[Johnny Knoxville]] during the monologue when Lorne introduces Johnny Knoxville to his daughter and Sophie shocks Knoxville with a taser. She also appeared in a sketch about underage drinking when [[Zac Efron]] hosted the show.

Perhaps Michaels' best-known appearance occurred in the first season when he offered [[the Beatles]] $3,000 (a deliberately paltry sum) to reunite on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75rbeatles.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Beatles Offer, April 24, 1976 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date= |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> He later upped his offer to $3,200, but the money was never claimed. According to an interview in ''Playboy'' magazine,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] happened to be in New York City that night and saw the show. They very nearly went, but changed their minds as it was getting too late to get to the show on time, and they were both tired. This near-reunion was the basis for the TV movie [[Two of Us (2000 television)|''Two of Us'']].  On the November 20th 1976 show, musical guest [[George Harrison]] appears, with Michaels telling Harrison the offer was conditioned on all four members of the group showing up, not just ''any'' Beatle. Harrison tells Michaels his refusal to pay him his share is "chintzy," and Michaels counters by saying The Beatles don't have to split the money equally.  They can give, say, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] less if they want.

==Other work==
Michaels started [[Broadway Video]] in 1979, producing such shows as ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]''.  Shortly afterwards, citing burnout, he left Saturday Night Live.  He returned to the show in 1985.

During his ''SNL'' hiatus, Michaels created another sketch show entitled ''[[The New Show]]'', which debuted on Friday nights in prime time on NBC in January 1984. The show failed to garner the same enthusiasm as ''SNL''.

In the 1980s, Michaels appeared in an [[HBO]] [[mockumentary]] titled ''[[The Canadian Conspiracy]]'' about the supposed subversion of the United States by Canadian-born media personalities, with [[Lorne Greene]] as the leader of the conspiracy. Michaels was identified as the anointed successor to Greene.

Michaels is also the executive producer of [[NBC]] show ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]],'' and was the executive producer of ''[[30 Rock]]'' and ''[[Up All Night (TV series)|Up All Night]]'' during their runs.

On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Michaels will be taking over as the executive producer for ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Consequently ''The Tonight Show'' moved to New York in early 2014 as ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', changing from ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/news/its-official-jimmy-fallon-will-replace-jay-leno-as-host-of-the-tonight-show-in-2014-136500861201 |title=It's Official: Jimmy Fallon Will Replace Jay Leno as Host of The Tonight Show in 2014 |publisher=TV.com |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>

In a 2008 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', as well in various other interviews, [[Tina Fey]] admitted that [[Alec Baldwin]]'s character [[Jack Donaghy]] on ''30 Rock'' is inspired by Michaels. In a different interview, on [[NPR]]'s radio show ''[[Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!]]'', Baldwin stated that some of his inspiration for Donaghy was drawn from Michaels.<ref>{{YouTube|o_IQQkfyhwk|Unscripted with Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey}} – 1:56–2:38.
