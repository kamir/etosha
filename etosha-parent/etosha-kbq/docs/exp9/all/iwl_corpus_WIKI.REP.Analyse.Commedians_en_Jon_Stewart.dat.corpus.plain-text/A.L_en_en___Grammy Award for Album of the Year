The '''[[Grammy Award]] for Album of the Year''' is presented by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency  and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position."<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref> Album of the Year is the most prestigious and final award category at the Grammys having been presented since [[1st Grammy Awards|1959]]. Although it was originally presented to the artist alone, the award is now presented to the main artist, the featured artist(s), the producer, the engineer and/or mixer and the mastering engineer. In [[Grammy Awards of 1962|1962]], the award name was extended to '''Album of the Year (other than classical)''' but, in [[Grammy Awards of 1965|1965]], the shorter name returned. It was not until [[Grammy Awards of 1968|1968]], [[Grammy Awards of 1969|1969]], [[41st Grammy Awards|1999]], [[53rd Grammy Awards|2011]], and [[56th Grammy Awards|2014]] that the award was won by a rock, [[country music|country]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Independent music|indie]], or [[electronic music]] album respectively. As of [[54th Grammy Awards|2012]], classical albums are eligible for this award, with the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Album|Best Classical Album]] being discontinued.

==Achievements==
[[Frank Sinatra]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Daniel Lanois]] (as producer) and [[Bob Ludwig]] (as mastering engineer) are the biggest winners in this category with three victories each. [[Bob Ludwig]] is the only person to win the award three consecutive years (2013-2015). [[Paul McCartney]] leads all performers with nine nominations: five as a member of [[The Beatles]], three for solo albums, and one as a member of [[Wings (band)|Wings]]. Frank Sinatra leads solo performers with eight nominations, seven for solo albums and one for a duet album. Paul McCartney and Paul Simon are the only artists with nominations in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s.

[[Norah Jones]] holds the female artist record with the most wins in this category with four, for her own album, ''[[Come Away with Me]]'', and as a featured artist on [[Outkast]]'s ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', [[Ray Charles]]' ''[[Genius Loves Company]]'' and [[Herbie Hancock]]'s ''[[River: The Joni Letters]]''. [[Natalie Cole]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]] are all tied with two wins each, winning for their respective albums, ''[[Unforgettable... with Love]]'', ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'', ''[[Raising Sand]]'' and ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'' and as featured artists (Hill on [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'', Cole and Raitt on Ray Charles' ''Genius Loves Company'' and Krauss on the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' soundtrack]]). To date, no woman has won the award more than once for her own albums.

The youngest album artist to win is [[Taylor Swift]], who won the award for ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' in 2010 at the age of 20. The Peasall Sisters, Sarah, Hannah and Leah, are the category's youngest credited winners, winning for their contributions to the album [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' soundtrack]] at the ages of 13, 9, and 7 respectively. Leah Peasall is the youngest winner of any Grammy in any category.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=peasall&title=&year=All&genre=All Past Winners Search | GRAMMY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The youngest person to make an appearance on an Album of the Year is [[Stevie Wonder]]'s daughter Aisha Morris who appeared on "[[Isn't She Lovely?]]" off the album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' as an infant.

The Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' was the first album by a [[rock and roll]] artist to win, [[Glen Campbell]]'s ''[[By The Time I Get To Phoenix]]'' was the first by a [[country]] artist, [[Lauryn Hill]]'s ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'' first by a [[hip hop]] artist, [[Arcade Fire]]'s ''[[The Suburbs (album)|The Suburbs]]'' the first [[Indie rock|Indie]] artist, and [[Daft Punk]]'s ''[[Random Access Memories]]'' the first by an [[electronic music]] artist.

Only two artists have ever been awarded the Grammy for "Album of the Year" in two consecutive years, [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. Sinatra had wins in 1966 and 1967 and Wonder followed with wins in 1974 and 1975. Wonder and Sinatra both won the most Grammys for Album of the Year within a decade. Sinatra had wins in 1960, 1966 and 1967, while Wonder had wins in 1974, 1975 and 1977.

Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, [[Barbra Streisand]], and [[Lady Gaga]] are the only artists to receive three consecutive nominations in this category, with Gaga being the only solo artist to receive this nomination for her first three albums. Additionally, The Beatles hold the record for most consecutive years being nominated for Album of the Year, with five.

To date, there have been two "live" albums to win the award: ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'' and ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert For Bangladesh]]'', though two "[[MTV Unplugged]]" albums ([[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Eric Clapton]]'s and [[MTV Unplugged: Tony Bennett|Tony Bennett]]'s) have won the award as well, which were performed in front of an intimate, live audience. One television soundtrack recording was also the very first recipient: ''[[The Music from Peter Gunn]]''. Two comedy albums have also triumphed in this category: ''[[The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart]]'' and ''[[The First Family (album)|The First Family]]''. There have been three soundtrack compilation albums that have been successful, as well: ''[[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|Saturday Night Fever]]'', ''[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|The Bodyguard]]'' and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]''.

Productions, Karl Richardson, Ralph MacDonald, Richard Finch, [[Ron Kersey]], Thomas J. Valentino & William Salter, as producers.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=saturday+night+fever&year=All&genre=13 Past Winners Search | GRAMMY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></li></small>

*B <span id=endnote_B/>'''[[#ref B|^]]'''<small>Only Houston and the producers of her tracks received the award.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=the+bodyguard&year=All&genre=13 Past Winners Search | GRAMMY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Unlike the other two soundtrack compilation albums to win this award, ''none'' of the other artists who appeared on ''The Bodyguard'' soundtrack ([[Kenny G]], [[Aaron Neville]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], [[The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.]], [[Curtis Stigers]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Sass Jordan]], and the uncredited instrumental ensemble that performed [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme) shared in the award, nor did the producers of those tracks (other than Cole, Foster & Clivilles who also produced some of Houston's tracks).</li></small>

*C <span id=endnote_C/>'''[[#ref C|^]]'''<small>Award recipients include Mike Piersante & [[Peter Kurland]], as engineers and mixers; Gavin Lurssen, as master engineer; [[T-Bone Burnett]], as producers; [[Alison Krauss]] & Union Station, [[Chris Sharp]], [[Chris Thomas King]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gillian Welch]], [[Harley Allen]], [[John Hartford]], [[Mike Compton (musician)|Mike Compton]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], Pat Enright, Peasall Sisters, [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Sam Bush]], [[Stuart Duncan]], [[The Cox Family]], The Fairfield Four, [[The Whites]] & [[Tim Blake Nelson]] (all from the U.S.) as featured artists. [[James Carter and the Prisoners]], [[Harry McClintock]] & [[The Stanley Brothers]] were not included as their recordings long preceded the soundtrack; the only members of those acts still alive at that time were James Carter (the only "Prisoner" from the [[Alan Lomax]] recording who was located) and Ralph Stanley (separately credited for recording "O, Death" specifically for the soundtrack). The [[Soggy Bottom Boys]] aren't credited as a group, but [[Dan Tyminski]] (the singing voice of [[George Clooney]] in the film) is credited as a member of Union Station, while the other two members (Harley Allen & Pat Enright) are credited individually. Chris Sharp, Mike Compton, Sam Bush & Stuart Duncan are not listed as lead or featured artists on any track, but were included for their instrumental credits on the album.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=o+brother+where+art+thou&year=All&genre=13 Past Winners Search | GRAMMY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></li></small>

<!-- == Confusion ==
Every year produces much confusion between the Grammy categories, [[Record of the Year]], [[Song of the Year]], and Album of the Year. Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the performing artist and the producer, recording engineer, and/or mixer for that song. Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually created the song in the first place. Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, producer, and recording engineer for that album. 
Removed this section, because it is mentioned in the overview of the article.-->
