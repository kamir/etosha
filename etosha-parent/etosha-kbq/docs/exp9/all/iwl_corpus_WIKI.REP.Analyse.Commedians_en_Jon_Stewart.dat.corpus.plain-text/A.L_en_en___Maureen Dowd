Dowd's columns have been described as letters to her mother, whom friends credit as "the source, the fountain of Maureen’s humor and her Irish sensibilities and her intellectual take."<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/> Dowd herself has said, "she is in my head in the sense that I want to inform and amuse the reader."<ref name="freshdialogues.com">[http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/04/03/maureen-dowd-talks-green/ Fresh Dialogues interview with Alison van Diggelen, April 2009]</ref> Dowd's columns are distinguished by an acerbic, often [[polemical]] writing style.<ref name="stiletto">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/04/AR2005110401996.html | title=Sex & the Single Stiletto | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | authorlink=Howard Kurtz | date=2005-10-05 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | pages=C01 | accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> Her columns often display a critical and irreverent attitude towards powerful, mostly political, figures such as former [[President of the United States|President]]s [[George W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Dowd also tends to refer to her subjects by nicknames.  For example, she has often referred to Bush as "W." and former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] as "Big Time."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/08/opinion/liberties-west-wing-chaperone.html | title=Liberties; West Wing Chaperone | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | date=2000-10-08 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>  She has called President [[Barack Obama]] "[[Spock]]"<ref name="spock">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/opinion/30dowd.html | title=As the Nation's Pulse Races, Obama Can't Seem to Find His | last=Dowd | first=Maureen | date=December 30, 2009 | work=[[The New York Times]] | pages=A27 | accessdate=January 3, 2010 }}</ref> and "Barry." Dowd's interest in candidates' personalities earned her criticism early in her career: "She focuses too much on the person but not enough on policy."<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/>

Dowd, who perceives her columns to be an exploration of politics, Hollywood, and gender related topics, often uses popular culture to support and metaphorically enhance her political commentary.<ref name="stiletto" /> In a ''Times'' video debate, she said of the [[Government of North Korea|North Korean government]]: "...you could look at a movie like ''[[Mean Girls]]'' and figure out the way these North Koreans are reacting; you know it's like high school girls with nuclear weapons—they just want some attention from us, you know?"<ref>{{cite video | people=[[David Brooks (journalist)|Brooks, David]]; Dowd, Maureen; [[Frank Rich|Rich, Frank]] (speakers) | url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2006/07/19/opinion/1194817112243/2-bushs-circle-of-trust.html | title=U.S. Politics: What's Next?<!-- see beginning of first video in the series -->—2: Bush's Circle of Trust | format=[[Flash Video]] | publisher=The New York Times | time=5:05 | date=2006-07-19 | accessdate=2009-05-19 }}</ref>

Dowd's columns have also been described as often being political cartoons that capture a caricatured view of the current political landscape with precision and exaggeration.<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/> For example, in the run-up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] Dowd wrote that [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate "[[Al Gore]] is so feminized and diversified and [[ecology|ecologically]] correct that he's practically [[lactation|lactating]],"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2007/11/6238_maureen_down_re.html | title=Maureen Dowd Rehashes the "Presidential Candidate X is a Wuss" Construct | last=Stein | first=Jonathan | work=MoJo (blog) | publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones and the Foundation for National Progress]] | date=2007-11-19 | accessdate=2009-05-19 }}</ref> while referring to the Democratic party as the "mommy party."<ref name="NYmag-dowd"/> In a Fresh Dialogues interview years later she said, "I was just teasing him a little bit because he was so earnest and he could be a little righteous and self important. That’s not always the most effective way to communicate your ideas, even if the ideas themselves are right. I mean, certainly his ideas were right but he himself was – sometimes – a pompous messenger for them."<ref name="freshdialogues.com"/>

''[[Talking Points Memo]]'' [[blog]]ger "thejoshuablog" found a paragraph in Dowd's May 17, 2009 ''Times'' column that was similar to one in a May 14 blog post by ''TPM'' editor [[Josh Marshall]], and accused her of [[plagiarism]].<ref>Philips, Angela.

On March 4, 2014, Dowd published a column about the dominance of men in the film industry; in it she quoted [[Amy Pascal]], co-chairman of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]].<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/dowd-frozen-in-a-niche.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}</ref> According to [[Buzzfeed]], “leaked emails from Sony” suggested that Dowd had promised to share the column with Pascal’s husband, former ''Times'' reporter [[Bernard Weinraub]] prior to the column's publication. Buzzfeed said  the column “painted Pascal in such a good light that she engaged in a round of mutual adulation with Dowd over email after its publication.”<ref>http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/leaked-emails-reveal-maureen-dowd-promised-to-sony-execs-hus#.khYrwZeAom</ref> Both Dowd and Weinraub have denied that Weinraub ever received the column. On December 12, 2014 ''Times'' public editor  Margaret Sullivan concluded, “While the tone of the email exchanges is undeniably gushy, I don’t think Ms. Dowd did anything unethical here.” Sullivan noted that Dowd was starting "a new writing assignment for the ''Times Magazine''."<ref>http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/maureen-dowd-amy-pascal-email-leak-questions/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22%7D</ref>

On May 2, 2015, Dowd published a column in the NY Times about her niece, Tara who had a stroke at age 41, caused by an arterial dissection in her brain.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-stroke-of-fate.html?_r=0</ref> Prior to the stroke, Tara had been a very active athlete. The first neurologist who saw Tara told her to cut back on physical activity, but a second neurologist, Dr. [[Louis R. Caplan]], a Harvard neurologist, disagreed with the first neurologist and told her to return to exercise, which she did safely.  In the article, Dr. Caplan neurologist suggested that going to the emergency rooms was "dangerous" and compared ERs to "local gas stations" where you should not get your brain, a "Rolls-Royce" serviced. He suggested you go see a neurologist instead of going to the ER.  These comments unleashed a firestorm of comments from emergency medicine physicians on social media, who thought that Caplan's comments were poorly informed and reckless, particularly sending the message not to go to the ER when you're having stroke, which directly contradicts recommendations from the American Heart Association to "call 9-1-1" when experiencing signs of stroke.<ref>http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/WarningSigns/Stroke-Warning-Signs-and-Symptoms_UCM_308528_SubHomePage.jsp</ref> In a related column in the Huffington Post, Dr. David Newman, an ER physician from Mount Sinai, wrote that Dr. Caplan's comments showed "poor insight" and "narrow expertise", claiming that subspecialty medicine as a whole was expensive and often unnecessarily invasive.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-h-newman-md/quiet-fortitude-in-the-er_b_7209372.html</ref>
