'''Thelma Ritter''' (February 14, 1902 – February 5, 1969) was an American actress, best known for her comedic roles as working class characters and strong [[New York City English|New York accent]]. She received six [[Academy Award]] nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and won one [[Tony Award]] for Best Leading Actress in a Musical.

==Early life==
Ritter was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], in 1902.<ref>Born in 1902 as per [http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/ssdi/search?l=Ritter&ss=X&f=Thelma&m=+&s1=&s2=&s3=&ib=0&ad=&by=1902&ba=0&dy=&da=0&bm=0&dm=0&bd=0&dd=0&rci=&bci=&rco=&bco=&rst=&bst=&rzi=&bzi= Social Security Death Index under the name '''Thelma Ritter''']</ref> After appearing in high school plays and [[Summer stock theatre|stock companies]], she trained as an actress at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].

==Career==
Ritter did stock theater and radio shows early in her career, without much impact. Ritter's first movie role was in ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947). She made a memorable impression in a brief uncredited part, as a frustrated mother unable to find the toy that [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]] has promised her son. Her second role, in writer-director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]'s ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949), left a mark, although Ritter was again uncredited. Mankiewicz kept Ritter in mind, and cast her as "Birdie" in ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950), which earned her an Oscar nomination. A second nomination followed for her work in [[Mitchell Leisen]]'s' classic ensemble [[screwball comedy]] ''[[The Mating Season (film)|The Mating Season]]'' (1951) starring [[Gene Tierney]] and [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]]. She enjoyed steady film work for the next dozen years.

She appeared in many of the episodic drama TV series of the 1950s, such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', and ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]''. Other film roles were as [[James Stewart]]'s nurse in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) and as [[Doris Day]]'s housekeeper in ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959). Although best known for comedy roles, she played the occasional dramatic role, most notably in ''[[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With a Song in My Heart]]'' (1952), ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953), ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), and ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961).

==Death==
Her last work was an appearance on ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]'' on January 23, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewindmillsofyourmind.com/jerry-lewis-show |title=Appearance on Jerry Lewis Show |publisher=Thewindmillsofyourmind.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> Ritter died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[New York City]], just nine days before her 67th birthday.
