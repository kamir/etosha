==Controversies==
In February 2010, [[Jack Shafer]] of [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] claimed that the chief investigative reporter for ''The Daily Beast'', [[Gerald Posner]], had lifted five sentences from a ''[[Miami Herald]]'' article and claimed that he had written them himself and was able to publish them in ''The Daily Beast'' under his own name. Shafer also discovered that Posner had written plagiarized content from a ''Miami Herald'' blog, a ''Miami Herald'' editorial, ''Texas Lawyer'' magazine and a health care journalism blog. An immediate internal investigation by ''The Daily Beast'' led to Posner's departure.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami-dade/story/1473780.html "Author Gerald Posner quits Daily Beast amid plagiarism allegations"]. ''Miami Herald''. 11 February 2010</ref>
