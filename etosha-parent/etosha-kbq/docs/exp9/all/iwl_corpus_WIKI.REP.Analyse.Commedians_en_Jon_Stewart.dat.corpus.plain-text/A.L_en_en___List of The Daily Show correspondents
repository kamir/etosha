{{refimprove|date=March 2012}}
This article is a list of the correspondents and on-screen contributors, past and present, who have appeared on the [[News satire|satirical]] [[television program]] ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''.  Correspondents, collectively known as '''"The Best F#@king News Team Ever"''', normally have two roles: "experts" with satirical "senior" titles whom host [[Jon Stewart]] interviews about certain issues, or hosts of original reporting segments which often showcase interviews of serious political figures. The show's contributors often have their own unique recurring segment on the show and tend to appear less frequently.
