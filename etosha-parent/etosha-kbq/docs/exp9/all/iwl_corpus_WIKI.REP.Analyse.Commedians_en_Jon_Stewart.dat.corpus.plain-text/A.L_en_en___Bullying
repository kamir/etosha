'''Bullying''' is the use of force, threat, or [[coercion]] to [[abuse]], [[intimidate]], or aggressively [[wikt:domination|dominate]] others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power. Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal [[harassment]] or [[threat]], physical [[assault]] or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets. [[Rationalization (making excuses)|Rationalizations]] for such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size or ability.<ref>{{cite web | title =Children who are bullying or being bullied | work = Cambridgeshire County Council: Children and families | publisher =Cambridgeshire County Council | date =2013-07-24 | url = http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last =Ericson | first =Nels | title =Addressing the Problem of Juvenile Bullying | journal =OJJDP Fact Sheet #FS-200127| volume =27 | publisher =U.S. Department of Justice: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention | date =June 2001 | url =https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/fs200127.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}</ref> If bullying is done by a group, it is called [[mobbing]].<ref name="DavenportSchwartz1999">{{cite book|author1=Noa Davenport|author2=Ruth Distler Schwartz|author3=Gail Pursell Elliott|title=Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JlJoyD84BfAC|accessdate=2013-10-28|date=1999-07-01|publisher=Civil Society Publishing|isbn=978-0-9671803-0-4}}</ref>

Bullying ranges from simple one-on-one bullying to more complex bullying in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who may seem to be willing to assist the primary bully in his or her bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse.<ref name="Bennett2006">{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bennett|title=Peer Abuse Know More!: Bullying from a Psychological Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infinity|isbn=978-0-7414-3265-0}}</ref> [[Robert W.

==Definitions==
Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally. Bullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person.<ref name="Besag1989">{{cite book|author=Valerie E.

# Physical (hitting, punching, or kicking) 
# Verbal (name-calling or taunting)
# Relational (destroying peer acceptance and friendships)
# Cyber-bullying (using electronic means to harm others)
Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier. Cyber-bullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.<ref name=":0" />

Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus<ref name="History">{{cite web | title =History | work =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | publisher =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | url = http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/history.html | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}</ref> says bullying occurs when a person is "exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons". He says negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways."<ref name="History"/>

==Etymology==
The word "[[bully]]" was first used in the 1530s meaning "sweetheart", applied to either sex, from the Dutch ''boel'' "lover, brother", probably diminutive of Middle High German ''buole'' "brother", of uncertain origin (compare with the German ''buhle'' "lover"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through "fine fellow", "blusterer", to "harasser of the weak". This may have been as a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" as in "protector of a prostitute", which was one sense of "bully" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb "to bully" is first attested in 1710.<ref>{{cite web | title =bully | work =Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher =Douglas Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}</ref>

Dr. Cook says that "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers".<ref name="APS2010">{{cite journal | authorlink = | title =Predictors of Bullying and Victimization in Childhood and Adolescence: A Meta-analytic Investigation | journal =School Psychology Quarterly | volume =25 | issue =2 | pages =65–83 | publisher = American Psychological Association | year =2010 | url =http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/spq-25-2-65.pdf | doi =10.1037/a0020149 | accessdate = 2013-10-28 | last1 = Cook | first1 = Clayton R. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Kirk R. | last3 = Guerra | first3 = Nancy G. | last4 = Kim | first4 = Tia E. | last5 = Sadek | first5 = Shelly}}</ref>

Contrarily, some researchers have suggested that some bullies are psychologically strongest and have high social standing among their peers, while their targets are emotionally distressed and socially marginalized.<ref>Juvonen (2003) [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1231.abstract ''Bullying Among Young Adolescents: The Strong, the Weak and the Troubled''] in ''Pediatrics'', December 2003, {{cite web

===Of typical bystanders===
Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present that instills the fear of "speaking out" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the "bully mentality" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, [[Norm (social)|norm]] within the group.<ref name = "bystander attitudes">{{cite web | title =Bullies, Victims, and Bystanders | work =athealth.com: Consumer: Issues | publisher =Athealth.com | url = http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title =New Tactics To Tackle Bystander's Role In Bullying | newspaper =Science Daily | department = Science News | publisher =Science Daily, LLC | date =2009-01-27 | url =http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>

Unless action is taken, a "[[Bullying culture|culture of bullying]]" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.<ref>{{cite web | title =419: Petty Tyrant | work =This American Life: Radio Archive | publisher =Chicago Public Media & Ira Glass | date =2010-11-12 | url = http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own "friendship group" or "support group" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.<ref>{{cite news | title =Pasco students get 'hero' training to stop bullying | newspaper =[[The Tampa Tribune]] | department = Pasco County | publisher =Tampa Media Group, LLC | date =2010-10-12 | url =http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | title =Program Helps Students Combat Bullying - Students participate with enthusiasm | work =Winning Harmony Counselling | location =Clearwater, Florida, U.S.A. | publisher =Jim Porter | date =2010-10-04 | url =http://www.winningharmony.com/News_and_Events.php | accessdate = 2013-10-29 | postscript =<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research that suggests interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Thornberg | first =Robert | last2 =Tenenbaum | first2 =Laura | last3 =Varjas | first3 =Kris | last4 =Meyers | first4 =Joel | last5 =Jungert | first5 =Tomas | last6 =Vanegas | first6 =Gina | title =Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene? | journal =Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume =13 | issue =3 | pages =247–252 | publisher =National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | date =August 2012 | language =  | doi =10.5811/westjem.2012.3.11792| pmc =3415829 | pmid =22900122}}</ref>

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression, particularly in women.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Jensen | first =I.

Children who bully typically show signs of an aggressive behavior, a need to dominate others, and have a positive attitude towards violence.

===Of victims===
Dr. Cook says that "A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers".<ref name="APS2010"/> Victims often have characteristics such as being physically weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|year= 2010 |volume=20 |issue=7|pages=315–320|last=Vanderbilt |first=Douglas |last2=Augustyn |first2=Marilyn |url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000715|title=The effects of bullying |doi=10.1016/j.paed.2010.03.008}}</ref>

The results of a  [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Cook and published by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also  for becoming bullies,  are the lack of [[social problem-solving]] skills.<ref name="APS2010"/>

Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities and spending time with friends or family, and having an overall sense of sadness.

Bullied students [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] carried out the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Since then, bullying has been more closely linked to high school violence in general.<ref>{{cite news | last =Boodman | first =Sandra G. | title =Gifted and Tormented | newspaper =The Washington Post | department = Health | publisher =The Washington Post | date =2006-05-16 | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051501103.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>

Serial killers were frequently bullied through direct and indirect methods as children or adolescents. [[Henry Lee Lucas]], a serial killer and diagnosed psychopath, said the ridicule and rejection he suffered as a child caused him to hate everyone. [[Kenneth Bianchi]], a serial killer and member of the [[Hillside Stranglers]], was teased as a child because he urinated in his pants and suffered twitching, and as a teenager was ignored by his peers.<ref>{{cite web | last =Scott | first =	Shirley Lynn | title =What Makes Serial Killers Tick? | work =Crime library | publisher =Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc.

===Positive development===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child "how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others", and that teachers should not intervene, but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves.<ref>{{cite news | author =Tanya | title =Child Development Academician Says Bullying Is Beneficial To Kids | work =Med India | department = News | publisher =Medindia | date =2009-02-02 | url =http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>

A few studies have pointed up some potentially positive outcomes from bullying behavior.<ref name="fight back">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1280625/Bullying-good-children-Study-finds-fight-popular.html Study describing how "learning to fight back" can help students to mature.]</ref>  These studies have found that with some individuals, as a result of their having been targeted with bullying behavior, this certain minority of former bullying "targets" have actually experienced being "enabled" through their experiences with bullying to develop various coping strategies, which included "standing up for themselves" in ways which acted to "re-balance" former imbalances of power.  Such former bullying targets have reported such things as "becoming a better person" as a result of their former bullying ordeals.<ref name = "fight back"/>  The teaching of such anti-bullying coping skills to "would-be-targets" and to others has been found to be an effective long term means of reducing bullying incidence rates and a valuable skill-set for individuals.<ref>[http://www.careforkids.com.au/childcarenews/2010/july/bullying.html Positive Anti-Bullying Strategies by Melissa Graham]</ref>

==Dark triad==
{{Main|Dark triad}}
Research on the dark triad ([[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]] and [[psychopathy]]) indicate a correlation with bullying as part of evidence of the aversive nature of those traits.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Chabrol&nbsp;H., Van Leeuwen N., Rodgers&nbsp;R., Séjourné&nbsp;S.| year = 2009 | title = Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume =47|issue=7|pages=734–39|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 | last2 = Van Leeuwen | last3 = Rodgers | last4 = Séjourné }}</ref>

==Projection==
{{Main|Psychological projection}}
A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity.  Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.<ref>Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p.&nbsp;185–6</ref>  Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.<ref name="micro and macro projection">Carl G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p.&nbsp;181–2</ref>

==Emotional intelligence==
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[power and control in abusive relationships|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]] (EI). [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = The Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 }}</ref> The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.<ref name=Tolegenova >Tolegenova, A.A., Jakupov, S.M., Man Cheung Chung, Saduova, S. & Jakupov, M.S (2012) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents.] "Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences", 69, 1891-1894.

===Cyberbullying===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.<ref name="BoltonGraeve2005">{{cite book|author1=Jose Bolton|author2=Stan Graeve|title=No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|isbn=978-1-889322-67-4}}</ref> With the creation of social networks like [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Instagram]], and [[Twitter]], cyberbullying has increased.

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Gay bullying===
{{Main|Gay bashing}}
Gay bullying and gay bashing are expressions used to designate [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] actions that are direct or indirect in nature by a person or group against a person who is gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered (LGBT), or of questionable [[sexual orientation]], or one who is perceived to be so, because of rumors or fitting gay stereotypes.  Gay and lesbian youth are more likely to report bullying.<ref name="Berlan et al., 2010">{{cite journal | last =Berlan | first =Elise D. | last2 =Corliss | first2 =Heather L. | last3 =Field | first3 =Alison E. | last4 =Goodman | first4 =Elizabeth | last5 =Austin | first5 =S.

===Legal bullying===
{{Main|Legal abuse}}
Legal bullying is the bringing of a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious legal action]] to control and punish a person.  Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle.  This can also take the form of [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPPs]].  It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

===Military bullying===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
In 2000, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) defined bullying as "the use of physical strength or the [[abuse of authority]] to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments".<ref>{{cite book | last =Dannatt | first =Sir Richard | title =Values and Standards of the British Army | chapter =Lawful: Paragraph 20 | publisher =the British Army | year =2008 | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which "soldiering" is different from other occupations.

===Parental bullying of children===
Parents who may [[Displacement (psychology)|displace]] their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and control upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.<ref name = "parent bullying">{{cite web | last =Priesnitz | first =	Wendy | title =Parental Bullying Creates Bullies | work =Natural Child Magazine | publisher =Wendy Priesnitz | url = http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>
The [[American Psychological Association]] advises on its website that parents who may suspect that their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.<ref name = "APA on parental bullying">{{cite web | title =Bullying: How parents, teachers, and kids can take action to prevent bullying | work =American Psychological Association | publisher =American Psychological Association | url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/bullying.aspx# | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>

===Prison bullying===
{{Main|Prisoner abuse}}
An environment known{{by whom|date=December 2014}} for bullying is a country's prison service. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying)
* Staff bullies inmate
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying)
* Inmate bullies staff

===School bullying===
{{Main|School bullying}}
{{See also|Bullying in teaching}}

Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building. Though it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. In the 2011 documentary [[Bully (2011 film)|''Bully'']], we see first hand the torture that kids go through both in school and while on the school bus. As the movie follows around a few kids we see how bullying affects them both at school as well as in their homes. While bullying has no age limit, these bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse ([[relational aggression]] or [[passive aggression]]), [[humiliation]], or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.<ref name="GarbarinodeLara2003">{{cite book|author1=James Garbarino|author2=Ellen deLara|title=And Words Can Hurt Forever: How to Protect Adolescents from Bullying, Harassment, and Emotional Violence|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-2899-2}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last =Witted | first =Kathryn Suzanne | title =Student Reports of Physical and Psychological Maltreatment in Schools: An Under Explored Aspect of Student Victimization in Schools | work = PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee | year =2005 | url =http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&context=utk_graddiss | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0013124507304487 |title=Do Teachers Bully Students?: Findings From a Survey of Students in an Alternative Education Setting |year=2007 |last1=Whitted |first1=K.

===Sexual bullying===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
{{See also|Slut-shaming}}
Sexual bullying is "any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender.

It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."<ref name=NSPCC02 >{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}</ref>

===Workplace bullying===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm.<ref>Rayner, C. & Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox & P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.</ref> Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.<ref>Rayner, C., & Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. & Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behaviour.<ref>Ramsay, S., Troth, A & Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(4), 799-816.</ref> Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization.  Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].

Bullying has been identified{{by whom|date=March 2014}} as prominent in blue collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops.

As the verb ''to bully'' is defined as simply "forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation", the term may generally apply to any life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals, such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power who may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood "protection racket don", a national dictator, a childhood ring-leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.<ref>{{cite news | last =Karim | first = Nadiya | title =Bullying in Universities: It exists | newspaper =The Independent | department = News: Education: Higher | publisher =The Independent | date =2010-01-15 | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}</ref>
