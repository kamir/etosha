'''Francis Albert''' "'''Frank'''" '''Sinatra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|r|ə}}; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998<ref name=PSCemDis>{{cite web|url=http://www.pscemetery.com/pdfs/interments.pdf|title=Palm Springs Cemetery District "Interment Information|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>) was an American singer, actor, director, and producer.

Beginning his musical career in the [[swing era]] as a boy singer with [[Harry James]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]], Sinatra found success as a solo artist from the early to mid-1940s after being signed by [[Columbia Records]] in 1943. Being the idol of the "[[bobby soxer]]s", he released his first album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. His professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, but it was reborn in 1953 after he won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''. He signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 1953 and released several critically lauded albums (such as ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'', ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'', ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'', ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]''). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, [[Reprise Records]] in 1961 (finding success with albums such as ''[[Ring-a-Ding-Ding!]]'', ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' and ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''), toured internationally, was a founding member of the [[Rat Pack]] and fraternized with celebrities and statesmen, including [[John F. Kennedy]].

Sinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective ''[[September of My Years]]'', starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]'', and scored hits with "[[Strangers in the Night]]" and "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". In 1967, he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album "''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''" which was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. It was followed by 1968's collaboration with [[Duke Ellington]]. With sales of his music dwindling and after appearing in several poorly received films, Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971. Two years later, however, he came out of retirement and from 1973 recorded several albums, scoring a Top 40 hit with "[[Theme from New York, New York|(Theme From) New York, New York]]" in 1980. Using his [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally, until a short time before his death in 1998. Sinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning Best Supporting Actor in 1953, he also garnered a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He also starred in such musicals as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957).

Sinatra is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1159006/this-week-in-billboard-history-frank-sinatras-mysterious-record-label-live|title=This Week in Billboard History: Frank Sinatra's 'Mysterious' Record Label; Live Aid's Bootlegging Scourge|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2011-12-06|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)]]|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983 and was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1985 and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==Early life==
[[File:Frank Sinatra as a small boy.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra as a small boy]]
Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915 in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]], the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina Garaventa<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp|25}} and [[Anthony Martin Sinatra|Antonino Martino Sinatra]],<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp|22}} and was raised Roman Catholic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ1003-OCT_SINATRA_rev_?click=main_sr|title=Frank Sinatra Has a Cold|publisher=[[Esquire (magazine)]]|date=October 8, 2007|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> In his book ''[[Try and Stop Me (book)|Try and Stop Me]]'' (p.&nbsp;218), American publisher and writer [[Bennett Cerf]] says that Sinatra's father was a lightweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien and served with the Hoboken Fire Department as a Captain. His mother, known as Dolly, was influential in the neighborhood and in local [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] circles, but also ran an illegal abortion business that provided services for free, from her home; she was arrested several times and convicted twice for this offense.<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp|16}} During the [[Great Depression]], Dolly nevertheless provided money to her son for outings with friends and expensive clothes.<ref name="Kelley">{{cite book|title=His Way: Frank Sinatra, the Unauthorized Biography|author-link=Kitty Kelley|first=Kitty|last=Kelley|year=1986|isbn=978-0-553-05137-7}}</ref>

==Career==

===1935–40: Start of career, work with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey===
Sinatra got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group, [[Frank Sinatra and the 3 Flashes|The Three Flashes]], to let him join. With Sinatra, the group became known as the Hoboken Four,<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/sinatra_frank/artist.jhtml#bio|title=Frank Sinatra|accessdate=2008-05-15|publisher=MTV|first=William|last=Ruhlmann}}</ref> and they sufficiently impressed [[Edward Bowes]]. After appearing on his show, ''[[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]]'',<ref name=pc22/> they attracted 40,000 votes and won first prize – a six-month contract to perform on stage and radio across the United States.

Sinatra left the Hoboken Four and returned home in late 1935. His mother secured him a job as a singing waiter and [[master of ceremonies|MC]] at the Rustic Cabin in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|Englewood Cliffs]], New Jersey,<ref name=pc22/> for which he was paid $15 a week.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Michael|url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1999/autumn/nelson-frank-sinatra/|title=Frank Sinatra: the Loneliness of the Long Distance Singer|date=Autumn 1999|publisher=VQR online}}</ref>

On March 18, 1939, Sinatra made a demo recording of a song called "Our Love", with the Frank Mane band. The record has "Frank Sinatra" signed on the front. The bandleader kept the original record in a safe for nearly 60 years.<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{Rp|needed=yes|date=January 2012}} In June, [[Harry James]] hired Sinatra on a one-year contract of $75 a week.<ref>Ingham, Chris. ''The Rough Guide to Frank Sinatra''. Rough Guides. June 30, 2005. ISBN 1-84353-414-2, p. 9.</ref> It was with the James band that Sinatra released his first commercial record "From the Bottom of My Heart" in July 1939<ref name=pc22>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19775/m1/|last=Gilliland|first=John|work=[[Pop Chronicles]]|title=Show 22 – Smack Dab in the Middle on Route 66: A skinny dip in the easy listening mainstream |publisher=UNT Digital Library|date=June 8, 1969}}</ref> – US Brunswick No.&nbsp;8443 and UK Columbia #DB2150.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ridgeway|first=John|year=1991|origyear=1978|title=The SinatraFile|volume=Part 2|publisher=John Ridgway Books|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-905808-08-6}}</ref>{{Rp|needed=yes|date=January 2012}} In September 1940, Sinatra, after playing with Tommy Dorsey at [[Old Orchard Beach, Maine#The Pier|Old Orchard Beach Pier]], surprised nightclubbers in Portland, Maine, by turning up at the Morocco Lounge.

Fewer than 8,000 copies of "From the Bottom of My Heart" (Brunswick No.&nbsp;8443) were sold, making the record a very rare find that is sought after by record collectors worldwide. Sinatra released ten commercial tracks with James through 1939, including "All or Nothing At All" which had weak sales on its initial release, but then sold millions of copies when re-released by Columbia at the height of Sinatra's popularity a few years later.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite news|work=Artists|title=Frank Sinatra|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/frank-sinatra/biography| publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref>

In November 1939, in a meeting at the Palmer House in Chicago, Sinatra was asked by bandleader [[Tommy Dorsey]] to join his band as a replacement for Jack Leonard (the vocalist, not to be confused with the comedian Jack E. Leonard), who had recently left to launch a solo career. This meeting was a turning point in Sinatra's career. By signing with Dorsey's band, one of the hottest at the time, he greatly increased his visibility with the American public. Though Sinatra was still under contract with James, James recognized the opportunity Dorsey offered and graciously released Sinatra from his contract.<ref name=pc1a>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|A}}</ref> Sinatra recognized his debt to James throughout his life and upon hearing of James' death in 1983, stated: "he [James] is the one that made it all possible."<ref name="Nancy 1986">{{cite book|last=Sinatra|first=Nancy|year=1986|title=Frank Sinatra, My Father|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-23356-9}}</ref>{{Rp|needed=yes|date=January 2012}}

On January 26, 1940, Sinatra made his first public appearance with the Dorsey band at the Coronado Theater in Rockford, Illinois.<ref>{{cite book|edition=1st|volume=Part 1|last=Ridgeway|first=John|year=1977|title=The SinatraFile|publisher=John Ridgway Books|isbn=0-905808-00-2}}</ref>{{Rp|needed=yes|date=January 2012}} In his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra released more than forty songs, with "I'll Never Smile Again" topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July.<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp |91}}

Sinatra's relationship with Tommy Dorsey was troubled, because of their contract, which awarded Dorsey one-third of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry. In January 1942, Sinatra recorded his first solo sessions without the Dorsey band (but with Dorsey's arranger [[Axel Stordahl]] and with Dorsey's approval). These sessions were released commercially on the Bluebird label. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid a fond farewell to Sinatra, replacing him with singer [[Dick Haymes]].<ref name=pc1a/>  But an incident started rumors of Sinatra's involvement with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]. A story appeared in the Hearst newspapers that mobster and Sinatra's Godfather [[Willie Moretti]] coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, and was fictionalized in the book and movie ''[[Johnny Fontane#Novel and film|The Godfather]]''.{{r |obrien20110210}} According to Nancy Sinatra's biography, the Hearst rumors were started because of Frank's Democratic politics. In fact, the contract was bought out by [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] founder [[Jules C. Stein]] for $75,000.<ref name="Nancy 1986"/>{{Rp|needed=yes|date=January 2012}}

===1940–50: Sinatramania and early films===
In May 1941, Sinatra was at the top of the male singer polls in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazines.<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp |94}} His appeal to [[bobby soxer]]s, as teenage girls of that time were called, revealed a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time.<ref>[http://century.guardian.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,,127764,00.html "Frank Sinatra and the 'bobby-soxers{{'"}}]. ''The Guardian'' (London). January 10, 1945. Retrieved 2012-06-02.</ref>

On December 30, 1942, Sinatra made a "legendary opening" at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theater]] in New York. [[Jack Benny]] later said, "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion&nbsp;... All this for a fellow I never heard of." When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944, 35,000 fans caused a near riot outside the venue because they were not allowed in.{{r|obrien20110210}}

During the [[1942–44 musicians' strike|musicians' strike of 1942–44]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] re-released Harry James and Sinatra's version of "[[All or Nothing at All]]" (music by Arthur Altman and lyrics by Jack Lawrence), recorded in August 1939 and released before Sinatra had made a name for himself. The original release did not mention the vocalist's name. When the recording was re–released in 1943 with Sinatra's name prominently displayed, the record was on the best–selling list for 18 weeks and reached number 2 on June 2, 1943.<ref>Peters, Richard (1982). ''Frank Sinatra Scrapbook''. New York: St. Martins Press. pp. 123, 157.</ref>
[[File:Sinatra Radio.gif|right|thumb|250px|Sinatra radio interview]]
Sinatra signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] on June 1, 1943, as a solo artist, and he initially had great success, particularly during the 1942–44 musicians' strike. Although no new records had been issued during the strike, he had been performing on the radio (on ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'') and on stage. Columbia wanted new recordings of their growing star as quickly as possible, so Sinatra convinced them to hire [[Alec Wilder]] as arranger and conductor for several sessions with a vocal group called the Bobby Tucker Singers. These first sessions were on June 7, June 22, August 5, and November 10, 1943. Of the nine songs recorded during these sessions, seven charted on the best–selling list.<ref>{{cite journal|type=CD booklet|title=Frank Sinatra: The Columbia Years: 1943–1952, The Complete Recordings|year=1993}}</ref>

Sinatra did not serve in the military during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was classified [[Class 1-A|4-F]] ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") for a perforated eardrum by his draft board. His exemption status occasionally resurfaced from certain critics, often Democrat pundits who resented his endorsement of Republican candidates when he turned Republican in the early 1970s. Biographers have noted that the singer actively supported the war effort (much as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope did, although both were much older), via USO shows and other actions in support of the military during and after WWII.<ref>Fuchs, Jeanne, and Ruth Prigozy (2007).

In her book "Over Here, Over There" with Bill Gilbert, Maxene Andrews recalled when Sinatra entertained the troops during one of several successful overseas USO tours with comedian [[Phil Silvers]] during the war, observing, "Sinatra asked whether they should take their own plane, but Bing [Crosby] said they'd fly the less comfortable military jets and that they should get busy 'singing our hearts out.' So, they did."<ref>Andrews, Maxene and Bill Gilbert: "The Andrews Sisters and the USO Stars in World War Two;" New York, Kensington, Zebra Books, 1993, 260 pages.</ref> Sinatra worked frequently with the popular [[The Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]], both on radio in the 1940s, appearing as guests on each other's shows, as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops via the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] (AFRS). He appeared as special guest on a pilot episode of the sisters' ABC ''[[Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch]]'' series at the end of 1944, and returned for another guest stint a few months later, while the trio in turn guested on his [[Songs by Sinatra]] series on CBS, to the delight of an audience filled with screaming bobby-soxers.

In 1945, Sinatra co-starred with [[Gene Kelly]] in ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]''. That same year, he was loaned out to RKO to star in a short film titled ''[[The House I Live In (1945 film)|The House I Live In]]''. Directed by [[Mervyn LeRoy]], this film on tolerance and [[racial equality]] earned a special [[Academy Award]] shared among Sinatra and those who brought the film to the screen, along with a special [[Golden Globe]] for "Promoting Good Will". 1946 saw the release of his first album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', and the debut of his own weekly radio show. By the end of 1948, Sinatra felt that his career was stalling, something that was confirmed when he slipped to No. 4 on ''[[Down Beat]]'''s annual poll of most popular singers (behind [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Frankie Laine]], and [[Bing Crosby]]).<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp |149}}

The year 1949 saw an upswing, as Frank co-starred with Gene Kelly in ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]''. It was well received critically and became a commercial success. That same year, Sinatra teamed up with Kelly for a third time in ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]''. Starting in September 1949, the [[BBDO|BBD&O]] advertising agency produced a radio series starring Sinatra for its client [[Lucky Strike]] called "Light Up Time" [http://www.watertownology.com/lightup] – some 176 15-minute shows which featured Frank and [[Dorothy Kirsten]] singing – which lasted through to May 1950.

===1950–60: Rebirth of career, Capitol concept albums===
After two years' absence, Sinatra returned to the concert stage on January 12, 1950, in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Sinatra's career and appeal to new teen audiences declined as he moved into his mid-30s.

In September 1951, Sinatra made his Las Vegas debut at the [[Desert Inn]], and he became a prominent figure on the Las Vegas scene [[Las Vegas in the 1950s|throughout the 1950s]] and 1960s. A month later, the second season of ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (CBS TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[CBS Television]]. Ultimately, Sinatra did not find the success on television for which he had hoped.

His last studio recording for Columbia was made in New York <ref>The SinatraFile by John Ridgway ©1991</ref> in September 1952, "Why Try To Change Me Now",<ref name=pc22/> with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. Columbia and MCA dropped him later in 1952.

The rebirth of Sinatra's career began with the eve-of-[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] drama ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. This role and performance marked a turnaround in Sinatra's career: after several years of critical and commercial decline, becoming an Oscar-winning actor helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world.<ref>Schmidt, M.A. [http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/eternity-ar.html "Best Pictures: ''From Here to Eternity''"]. The New York Times. May 9, 1954.</ref>

In 1953, Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program ''[[Rocky Fortune]]''. His character, Rocco Fortunato (a.k.a. Rocky Fortune) was a temp worker for the Gridley Employment Agency who stumbled into crime-solving by way of the odd jobs to which he was dispatched. The series <ref>[http://www.watertownology.com/RockyFortune Rocky Fortune Show]. Watertownology.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23.</ref> aired on NBC radio Tuesday nights from October 1953 to March 1954, following the network's crime drama hit ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. During the final months of the show, just before the 1954 Oscars, it became a running gag that Sinatra would manage to work the phrase "from here to eternity" into each episode, a reference to his Oscar-nominated performance.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/OTRR_Rocky_Fortune_Singles ''Rocky Fortune''] Old Time Radio Researchers Group, Archive.org. Retrieved 2009-04-09.</ref>

Also in 1953, Sinatra signed with [[Capitol Records]], where he worked with many of the finest musical arrangers of the era, most notably [[Nelson Riddle]],<ref name=pc22/> [[Gordon Jenkins]], and [[Billy May]]. With a series of albums featuring darker emotional material, Sinatra reinvented himself, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955) – Sinatra's first 12" LP and his second collaboration with Nelson Riddle – ''[[Where Are You? (Frank Sinatra album)|Where Are You?]]'' (1957) his first album in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins, and ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely]]'' (1958). He also incorporated a hipper, "swinging" persona into some of his music, as heard on ''[[Swing Easy!]]'' (1954), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), and ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly With Me]]'' (1957).

By the end of the year, Billboard had named "Young at Heart" Song of the Year (the title song of his 1954 movie with [[Doris Day]]); ''[[Swing Easy!]]'', with Nelson Riddle at the helm (his second album for Capitol), was named Album of the Year; and Sinatra was named "Top Male Vocalist" by ''Billboard'', ''[[Down Beat]]'' and ''[[Metronome]]''.

A third collaboration with Nelson Riddle, released in March 1956, ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'', was both a critical and financial success, featuring a recording of "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]".

''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely]]'', a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads, was released in September 1958, and proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards album chart and peaking at No.&nbsp;1. Cuts from this LP, such as "Angel Eyes" and "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of Sinatra's concerts and played as evocative of the mood of an era and still are sung with appreciation even today.

Through the late fifties, Sinatra defended the classy, stylish, lyrical music genre of the 30's and 40's that evoked romance and respect for women, but frequently criticized rock and roll music. Sinatra despised music that he found publicly demeaning of women and tasteless.

Sinatra's 1959 hit "[[High Hopes (Frank Sinatra song)|High Hopes]]" lasted on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks, more than any other Sinatra hit did on that chart, and was a recurring favorite for years on ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''.

===1960–70: ''Ring-a-Ding-Ding!'', Reprise records, Basie, Jobim, "My Way"===

Sinatra started the 1960s as he ended the 1950s. His first album of the decade, ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'', topped ''Billboard''{{'}}s chart and won critical plaudits. Sinatra grew discontented at Capitol and decided to form his own label, [[Reprise Records]]. His first album on the label, ''[[Ring-a-Ding-Ding!]]'' (1961), was a major success, peaking at No.4 on ''Billboard'' and No.8 in the UK.
[[File:Frank Sinatra laughing.jpg|thumb|Frank Sinatra at Girl's Town Ball in Florida, March 12, 1960]]

In 1965, he starred in what was considered one of his most successful films, ''[[Von Ryan's Express]]''.  His fourth and final [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] TV special was broadcast in March 1960, and earned massive viewing figures. Titled ''It's Nice to Go Travelling'', the show is more commonly known as ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis|Welcome Home Elvis]]''. [[Elvis Presley]]'s appearance after his army discharge was somewhat ironic; Sinatra had been scathing about rock and roll earlier, saying: "His kind of music is deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac. It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people."<ref>Khurana, Simran.

Retrieved 2007-10-14.</ref> Presley had responded: "...&nbsp;[Sinatra] is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it&nbsp;...

The Biography'', Plexus. p. 126</ref> Later, in efforts to maintain his commercial viability, Sinatra recorded Presley's hit "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]" as well as works by [[Paul Simon]] ("[[Mrs. Robinson]]"), [[the Beatles]] ("[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]", "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]"), and [[Joni Mitchell]] ("[[Both Sides, Now]]").<ref>{{Wayback |date=20000903083034 |url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/sinatra2.html |title=''The TIME 100''}}.

Following on the heels of the film ''Can Can'' was ''[[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'', the movie that became the definitive on-screen outing for "[[The Rat Pack]]", a group of entertainers led by Sinatra who worked together on a loose basis in films and casino shows featuring [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Joey Bishop]]. Subsequent pictures together included ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' and ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'', although the movies' rosters of actors varied slightly.  [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] was replaced with [[Steve McQueen]] in ''[[Never So Few]]'' and [[Peter Lawford]] with [[Bing Crosby]] in ''Robin and the 7 Hoods''.

From his youth, Sinatra displayed sympathy for African Americans and worked both publicly and privately all his life to help them win equal rights. He played a major role in the [[desegregation]] of [[Nevada]] hotels and casinos in the 1960s often stepping in to demand apologies for a racist incident and abolishing of [[Jim Crow]] policies before he would fulfill his show contract. On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played a benefit show at [[Carnegie Hall]] for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and led his fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers. He often spoke from the stage on desegregation and repeatedly played benefits on behalf of Dr. King and his movement. According to his son, [[Frank Sinatra, Jr.]], King sat weeping in the audience at one of his father's concerts in 1963 as Sinatra sang ''[[Ol' Man River]]'', a song from the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' that is sung by an African-American stevedore. His well-known support for African-Americans was the subject of a piece in the Chicago Tribune by Laura S. Washington.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1998-06-08 | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-08/news/9806080001_1_frank-sinatra-sinatra-fan-billie-holiday |title=Race Relations Sinatra's Way}}</ref>

On September 11 and 12, 1961, Sinatra recorded his final songs for Capitol.

In 1962, he starred with [[Janet Leigh]] and [[Laurence Harvey]] in the political thriller, ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', playing Bennett Marco. That same year, Sinatra and [[Count Basie]] collaborated for the album ''[[Sinatra-Basie]]''. This popular and successful release prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'', which was arranged by [[Quincy Jones]]. One of Sinatra's more ambitious albums from the mid-1960s, ''[[The Concert Sinatra]]'', with a 73-piece symphony orchestra led by Nelson Riddle, was recorded on a motion picture scoring stage with the use of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed 35&nbsp;mm magnetic film (multi-track tape mastering machines were then limited to 4 tracks, although 3 tracks was more common; an 8 track machine, "The Octopus", had been made as a "one-off" for [[Les Paul]] earlier).

Sinatra's first live album, ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', was recorded during January and February 1966 at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas.
[[File:Dean Martin Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Show 1958.JPG|left|thumb|Martin with Sinatra]]
In June 1965, Sinatra, [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], and [[Dean Martin]] played live in [[St. Louis]] to benefit Dismas House, a prisoner rehabilitation and training center with nationwide programs that in particular helped serve African Americans. The [[Rat Pack]] concert was broadcast live via satellite to numerous movie theaters across America. Released in August 1965 was the Grammy Award–winning album of the year, ''[[September of My Years]]'', containing the single "[[It Was a Very Good Year]]", which won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male in 1966. A career anthology, ''[[A Man and His Music]]'', followed in November, winning Album of the Year at the Grammys in 1966. The TV special, ''Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music'', garnered both an Emmy award and a [[Peabody Award]].

In spring, ''[[That's Life (Frank Sinatra album)|That's Life]]'' appeared, with both the single and album becoming Top Ten hits in the US on ''Billboard'''s pop charts. ''[[Strangers in the Night]]'' went on to top the ''Billboard''<ref name=pc22/> and UK pop singles charts, winning the award for Record of the Year at the [[Grammys]]. The [[Strangers in the Night (Frank Sinatra album)|album of the same name]] also topped the ''Billboard'' chart and reached number 4 in the UK.

Sinatra started 1967 with a series of recording sessions with [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]]. Later in the year, a duet with daughter Nancy, "[[Somethin' Stupid]]", topped the ''Billboard'' pop and UK singles charts. In December, Sinatra collaborated with [[Duke Ellington]] on the album ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]''.

During the late 1960s, press agent [[Lee Solters]] would invite columnists and their spouses into Sinatra's dressing room just before he was about to go on stage. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' recounted that "the first columnist they tried this on was Larry Fields of the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', whose wife fainted when Sinatra kissed her cheek. 'Take care of it, Lee,' Sinatra said, and he was off." The professional relationship Sinatra shared with Solters focused on projects on the west coast while those focused on the east coast were handled by Solters' partner, Sheldon Roskin of Solters/Roskin/Friedman, a well-known firm at the time.<ref>Martin, Douglas. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/theater/22solters.html "Lee Solters, Razzle-Dazzle Press Agent, Dies at 89"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 2009. Accessed 2009-05-22.</ref>

Back on the small-screen, Sinatra once again worked with Jobim and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] on the TV special, ''[[A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim]]''.

With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter [[Paul Anka]] wrote the song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]", inspired by the French "Comme d'habitude" ("As Usual"), composed by [[Claude François]] and [[Jacques Revaux]]. "My Way" became more closely identified with Sinatra than any other song over his seven decades as a singer, even though he reputedly did not care for it.

===1970–80: "Retirement" and return===

[[File:Andreotti Sinatra Nixon.jpg|thumb|Frank Sinatra, with [[Giulio Andreotti]] (left), President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] at the White House, 1973]]
On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement. The final song recorded at the session was written by John Denver and titled "The Game is Over". However, this song was not released officially until ''The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings'' suitcase box-set, which went on sale in 1995 to commemorate his 80th birthday.

On June 13, 1971, at a concert in Hollywood to raise money for the Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund, at the age of 55, Sinatra announced that he was retiring, presumably bringing to an end his 36-year career in show business.

While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing "My Kind of Town" for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972. It is the only known public performance he gave during his "retirement" period.

In 1973, Sinatra came out of his short-lived retirement with a television special and album, both entitled ''[[Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back]]''. The album, arranged by Gordon Jenkins and [[Don Costa]], was a great success, reaching number 13 on ''Billboard'' and number 12 in the UK. The TV special was highlighted by a dramatic reading of "[[Send in the Clowns]]" and a song-and-dance sequence with former co-star Gene Kelly.

In January 1974, Sinatra returned to Las Vegas, performing at [[Caesars Palace]] despite vowing in 1970 never to play there again after the manager of the resort, [[Sanford Waterman]], pulled a gun on him during a heated argument.<ref name="Kelley" />{{rp |436}} In Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists there – who were aggressively pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conference – as "fags", "pimps", and "whores". Australian unions representing transport workers, waiters, and journalists went on strike, demanding that Sinatra apologize for his remarks.<ref name="Kelley" />{{rp |464}} Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for "fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press".<ref name="Kelley" />{{rp |464}} The future [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Bob Hawke]], then the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)]] leader, also insisted that Sinatra apologize, and a settlement was eventually reached to the apparent satisfaction of both parties.<ref name="Kelley" />{{rp |464}} Sinatra's final show of his Australian tour was televised.

In October 1974, Sinatra appeared at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title ''[[The Main Event – Live]]''. Backing him was bandleader [[Woody Herman]] and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month. The TV special garnered mostly positive reviews while the album – actually culled from various shows during his comeback tour – was only a moderate success, peaking at No.37 on ''Billboard'' and No.30 in the UK.

In August 1975, Sinatra held several consecutive concerts together with the newly-risen singer [[John Denver]]. Soon they became friends. John Denver later appeared as a guest in the ''Sinatra and Friends'' TV Special, singing "September Song" together with Sinatra. Sinatra covered the John Denver hits "My Sweet Lady" and "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]". And, according to Denver, his song "A Baby Just Like You" was written at Sinatra's request.

During Labor Day weekend 1976 Sinatra was responsible for reuniting old friends and comedy partners Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis for the first time in nearly twenty years. Sinatra performed for the "Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon" that afternoon and before he performed he brought Martin out on stage.

In 1979, in front of the [[Egyptian pyramids]], Sinatra performed for [[Anwar Sadat]]. Back in Las Vegas, while celebrating 40 years in show business and his 64th birthday, he was awarded the [[Grammy Trustees Award]] during a party at Caesars Palace.

===1980–90: ''Trilogy'', ''She Shot Me Down'', ''L.A. Is My Lady''===
[[File:C10774-23A.jpg|thumb|Sinatra sings with then First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[White House]].]]

In 1980, Sinatra's first album in six years was released, ''[[Trilogy: Past Present Future]]'', a highly ambitious triple album that found Sinatra recording songs from the past (pre-rock era) and present (rock era and contemporary) that he had overlooked during his career, while 'The Future' was a free-form suite of new songs linked à la musical theater by a theme, in this case, Sinatra pondering over the future. The album garnered six [[Grammy]] nominations – winning for best liner notes – and peaked at number 17 on ''Billboard'''s album chart, while spawning yet another song that would become a signature tune, "[[Theme from New York, New York|Theme from New York, New York"]], as well as Sinatra's much lauded (second) recording of [[George Harrison]]'s "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" (the first was not officially released on an album until 1972's ''[[Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2]]'').

The following year, Sinatra built on the success of ''Trilogy'' with ''[[She Shot Me Down]]'', an album that revisited the dark tone of his Capitol years, and was praised by critics as a vintage late-period Sinatra. Sinatra would comment that it was "A complete saloon album&nbsp;... tear-jerkers and cry-in-your-beer kind of things".<ref name="She Shot Me Down">"[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r26337|pure_url=yes}} ''She Shot Me Down'']. Allmusic.com. Retrieved 2006-11-28.</ref>

Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a ten-day engagement for $2&nbsp;million in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], in the internationally unrecognized "independent" [[bantustan]] [[Bophuthatswana]], breaking a cultural boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. Bophuthatswana's president, [[Lucas Mangope]], awarded Sinatra with Bophuthatswana's highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.<ref>Lamb, David. ''The Africans'', p. 328</ref>

He was selected as one of the five recipients of the 1983 [[Kennedy Center Honors]], alongside [[Katherine Dunham]], [[James Stewart]], [[Elia Kazan]], and [[Virgil Thomson]]. Quoting [[Henry James]], President Reagan said in honoring his old friend that "art was the shadow of humanity" and that Sinatra had "spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow".<ref name="Kelley" />{{rp |544}}

In 1984, Sinatra worked with Quincy Jones for the first time in nearly two decades on the album, ''[[L.A. Is My Lady]]'', which was well received critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with [[Lena Horne]], which had to be abandoned. (Horne developed vocal problems and Sinatra, committed to other engagements, could not wait to record.)

===1990s: ''Duets'', final performances===
In 1990 Sinatra was awarded the second "Ella Award" by the Los Angeles-based [[Society of Singers]], and performed for a final time with Ella Fitzgerald at the award ceremony.<ref name="MichaelFreedland">Freedland, Michael.

The album and its sequel, ''[[Duets II (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets II]]'', would see Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a pre-recorded tape.<ref name="Santopietro"/>

Still touring despite various health problems, Sinatra remained a top concert attraction on a global scale during the first half of the 1990s. At times during concerts his memory failed him and a fall onstage in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in March 1994, signaled further problems. Sinatra's final public concerts were held in Japan's [[Fukuoka Dome]] in December 1994. The following year, on February 25, 1995, at a private party for 1200 select guests on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament, Sinatra sang before a live audience for the very last time. ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' reported of the show that Sinatra was "clear, tough, on the money" and "in absolute control". His closing song was "[[The Best Is Yet to Come (song)|The Best is Yet to Come]]".

Sinatra was awarded the [[Grammy Legend Award|Legend Award]] at the [[1994 Grammy Awards]], where he was introduced by [[Bono]], who said of him, "Frank's the chairman of the bad attitude&nbsp;... Rock 'n roll plays at being tough, but this guy is the boss – the chairman of boss&nbsp;...

In 1995, to mark Sinatra's 80th birthday, the [[Empire State Building]] glowed blue. A star-studded birthday tribute, ''Sinatra: 80 Years My Way'', was held at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. At the end of the program Sinatra graced the stage for the last time to sing the final notes of "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]" with an ensemble. It was Sinatra's last televised appearance.

In recognition of his many years of association with Las Vegas, Frank Sinatra was elected to the [[Gaming Hall of Fame]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Gaming Hall of Fame|url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/hof/index.html|publisher=[[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]|accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref>

==Personal life==
{{See also|Relationships of Frank Sinatra}}
Sinatra had three children, [[Nancy Sinatra|Nancy]], [[Frank Sinatra, Jr.|Frank Jr.]], and [[Tina Sinatra|Tina]], all with his first wife, Nancy Sinatra (née Barbato) (m. 1939–1951). He was married three more times, to actresses [[Ava Gardner]] (m. 1951–1957), [[Mia Farrow]] (m. 1966–1968), and finally to [[Barbara Marx]] (m. 1976–1998; his death). In a 2013 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article, Mia Farrow claimed that Sinatra may be the father of her son, [[Ronan Farrow]]; but she did not produce, and has not since produced, any DNA or other evidence to support that possibility.<ref name="vanityfair.com">{{cite web| url = http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal | title = Mia Farrow and Eight of Her Children Speak Out on Their Lives, Frank Sinatra, and the Scandals They've Endured| work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref>

Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Avoiding solitude and unglamorous surroundings at all cost, he struggled with the conflicting need "to get away from it all, but not too far away."<ref name="Kaplan">{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=James|title=Frank the Voice|publisher=Doubleday|year=2010}}</ref>{{rp |485}} He acknowledged this, telling an interviewer in the 1950s: "Being an 18-karat [[manic depressive]], and having lived a life of violent emotional contradictions, I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation."<ref name="Summers Swan" />{{rp|218}} In her memoirs ''My Father's Daughter'', his daughter Tina wrote about the "eighteen-karat" remark: "As flippant as Dad could be about his mental state, I believe that a [[Zoloft]] a day might have kept his demons away.

In a 1963 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Sinatra described his religious views, stating {{Quote|I think I can sum up my religious feelings in a couple of paragraphs. First: I believe in you and me. I'm like [[Albert Schweitzer]] and [[Bertrand Russell#Views on religion|Bertrand Russell]] and [[Albert Einstein's religious views|Albert Einstein]] in that I have a respect for life – in any form.

However, though turned off by organized religion at times, Sinatra had a deep faith that became public when he turned to the Catholic Church for healing after his mother died in a plane crash late in his career.

For a year Hoover investigated Sinatra's alleged Communist affiliations, but found no evidence. The files include his rendezvous with prostitutes, and his extramarital affair with Ava Gardner, which preceded their marriage. Celebrities mentioned in the files are [[Dean Martin]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Peter Lawford]], and Giancana's girlfriend, singer [[Phyllis McGuire]].

The FBI's secret dossier on Sinatra was released in 1998 in response to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.

The released FBI files reveal some tantalizing insights into Sinatra's lifetime consistency in pursuing and embracing seemingly conflicting affiliations. But Sinatra's alliances had a practical aspect. They were adaptive mechanisms for behavior motivated by self-interest and inner anxieties. In September 1950 Sinatra felt particularly vulnerable. Sinatra "was scared, his career had sprung a leak." In a letter dated September 17, 1950, to [[Clyde Tolson]], Deputy FBI Director, in response to government investigations of Mafia intrusions into some parts of the entertainment industry, Sinatra offered to be of service to the FBI as an informer. An excerpted passage from a memo in FBI files states that Sinatra "feels he can be of help as a result of going anywhere the Bureau desires and contacting any people from whom he might be able to obtain information. Sinatra feels as a result of his publicity he can operate without suspicion&nbsp;... he is willing to go the whole way." The FBI declined his assistance but mentioned their gratitude for his willingness to assist in cleaning up organized crime in the industry.<ref name="Kaplan" />{{rp|446–47}}

==Political views==
Sinatra held differing political views throughout his life.
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt Frank Sinatra 1947.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and Sinatra in 1947.]]
Sinatra's parents had immigrated to the United States in 1895 and 1897 respectively. His mother, Dolly Sinatra (1896–1977), was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] ward leader.<ref>''Sinatra: The Life'', Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan, p. 16</ref>

Sinatra remained a supporter of the Democratic Party until the early 1970s when he switched his allegiance to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as the Democratic Party under George McGovern took a sharp turn to the left that was in conflict with his more traditional values.

===Political activities 1944–68===
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt Frank Sinatra.jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra, pictured here with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] in 1960, was an ardent supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] until 1964.]]

In 1944, after sending a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in support of the president's stewardship in wartime, Sinatra was invited to meet Roosevelt at the [[White House]], where he agreed to become part of the Democratic party's voter registration drives, and heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 presidential election]].<ref name="MartinSmith">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Martin|year=2005|title=When Ol' Blue Eyes was a Red|publisher=Redwords|isbn=1-905192-02-9}}</ref>{{rp |40}}<ref name="MartinSmith" />{{rp |40}}

In [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]], Sinatra actively campaigned for President [[Harry S. Truman]].<ref name="ws;">{{cite web|author=Steve Pond|url=http://www.sinatra.com/legacy/frank-sinatra-and-politics|work=Legacy|title=Frank Sinatra and Politics|publisher=Sinatra.com|date=July 4, 1991|accessdate=2011-07-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515000915/http://www.sinatra.com/legacy/frank-sinatra-and-politics|archivedate=2011-05-15}}</ref> In 1952 and 1956, he also campaigned for [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].<ref name="ws;"/>

Of all the U.S. Presidents he associated with during his career, he was closest to [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name=ws; /> In 1960, Sinatra and his friends Peter Lawford, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. actively campaigned for Kennedy throughout the United States;<ref name="ws;" /> A specially recorded version of "[[High Hopes (Frank Sinatra song)|High Hopes]]" with lyrics praising Kennedy, was frequently played during the 1960 presidential election.<ref name=ws; />

In January 1961, Sinatra and [[Peter Lawford]] organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, DC, held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office.<ref name=ws; /> The event, featuring many notable entertainment figures, was an enormous success, raising a large amount of money for the Democratic Party.<ref name="Kelley"/>{{Rp | needed = yes|date=January 2012}}

Sinatra's move toward the Republicans seems to have begun when he was snubbed by President Kennedy in favor of [[Bing Crosby]],<ref name=lpo>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodusa.co.uk/WestwoodObituaries/peterlawford.htm|title=Peter Lawford's grave|publisher=Hollywood, USA|location=UK|accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref> a fellow singer and a Republican, for Kennedy's visit to [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], in 1962. Kennedy had planned to stay at Sinatra's home over the Easter holiday weekend, but decided against doing so because of Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime.<ref name= lpo /> Kennedy stayed at Crosby's house instead.<ref name=lpo/> Sinatra had invested a lot of his own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/sinatra-turned-violent-after-kennedy-snub|title=Frank Sinatra Turned Violent After Kennedy Snub|publisher=Contact Music|accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref> At the time, President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], was intensifying his own investigations into organized crime figures such as Chicago mob boss [[Sam Giancana]], who had earlier stayed at Sinatra's home. Despite his break with Kennedy, however, he still mourned when Kennedy was assassinated.<ref name="ws;" /> According to his daughter Nancy, Sinatra learned of Kennedy's assassination while filming a scene of ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' in Burbank.<ref name=ws; />  Sinatra quickly finished filming the scene, returned to his Palm Springs home, and sobbed in his bedroom for three days.<ref name=ws;/>

===Political activities 1970–94===
In 1970, the first sign of Sinatra's break from the Democratic Party came when he endorsed [[Ronald Reagan]] for a second term as [[Governor of California]];<ref name="MichaelFreedland" /><ref name="ws;" /> Sinatra, however, remained a registered Democrat and encouraged Reagan to become more moderate.<ref name="ws;" /> In July 1972, after a lifetime of supporting Democratic presidential candidates, Sinatra announced he could not support the left-ward turn of the party and its candidate, George McGovern, and would therefore support Republican U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] for re-election in the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]]. His switch to the Republican Party was now official;<ref name="ws;" /> he even told his daughter Tina, who had actively campaigned for Nixon's Democratic opponent [[George McGovern]],<ref name=ws; /> "the older you get, the more conservative you get."<ref name=ws; /> Sinatra said he agreed with the Republican Party on most positions.<ref name="MartinSmith"/>

[[File:Frank Sinatra and Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra is awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].]]

During Nixon's Presidency, Sinatra visited the White House on several occasions.<ref name=ws; />

In the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], Sinatra supported Ronald Reagan and donated $4&nbsp;million to Reagan's campaign. Sinatra said he supported Reagan as he was "the proper man to be the President of the United States&nbsp;... it's so screwed up now, we need someone to straighten it out."<ref name="MichaelFreedland" />{{rp |395}} Reagan's victory gave Sinatra his closest relationship with the White House since the early 1960s.<ref name="ws;" /> Sinatra arranged Reagan's Presidential gala, as he had done for Kennedy 20 years previously.<ref name="Kelley" />{{rp |503}} In 1984, Sinatra returned to his birthplace in Hoboken, bringing with him President Reagan, who was in the midst of campaigning for the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]].
