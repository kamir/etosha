He wanted to see the world: "I used to spend nights looking at atlases. I decided I wanted to be a chef on a plane.

Jackman went to primary school at Pymble Public School and later attended the all-boys [[Knox Grammar School]] on Sydney's [[Upper North Shore]], where he starred in its production of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in 1985, and became the school captain in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scobie |first=Claire |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3833405/Hugh-Jackman-X-appeal.html |title=Hugh Jackman: X Appeal |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=6 September 2010 }}</ref> Following graduation, he spent a [[gap year]] working at [[Uppingham School]] in England.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood star, Hugh Jackman, returns to Uppingham|url=http://www.uppingham.co.uk/hollywood-star-hugh-jackman-returns-to-uppingham|accessdate=9 November 2013|newspaper=[[Uppingham School]]|date=25 May 2012}}</ref> On his return, he studied at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]], graduating in 1991 with a BA in [[Communication studies|Communications]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/detail.cfm?ItemId=11098|title=Alumnus Hugh Jackman honoured at UTS 20-year celebration|accessdate=27 May 2009}}</ref> In his final year of university, he took a drama course to make up additional credits. The class did [[Václav Havel]]'s [[The Memorandum]] with Jackman as the lead.<ref name="bravo"/> He later commented, "In that week I felt more at home with those people than I did in the entire three years [at university]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Lariviere|first=Serafin|title=Hugh Jackman on overcoming his fear of being called a poof|url=http://dailyxtra.com/toronto/arts-and-entertainment/hugh-jackman-overcoming-fear-called-poof|accessdate=9 November 2013|newspaper=Daily Xtra|date=29 June 2011}}</ref>

After obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course "The Journey" at the Actors' Centre in Sydney.<ref name="bravo"/> About studying acting full-time, he stated, "It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'."<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book |first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=87|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}</ref> After completing "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' but turned it down<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/hugh_jackman_biog/2.html|title=''home and away''|accessdate=27 May 2009}}</ref> to attend the [[Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts]] of [[Edith Cowan University]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]], from which he graduated in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=77&ContentID=8095|title=Jackman back as boy from Waapa|accessdate=27 May 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Jackman has said he "always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'"<ref name="shavemagazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-Hugh-Jackman/2 |title=Interview: Hugh Jackman |publisher=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]] |first=Ziyah |last=Karmali |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early work===
On the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on ''[[Correlli]]'': "I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds." ''Correlli'', devised by Australian actress [[Denise Roberts]], was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife [[Deborra-Lee Furness]]: "Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it."<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book |first=|title=Biography Today |year=201 0|page=876 |publisher=Omnigraphics |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}</ref> The show lasted only one season.

After ''Correlli'' Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played [[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]] in the local Walt Disney production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and Joe Gillis in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.<ref name="bravo"/> During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 [[Midsumma]] festival cabaret production ''[[Summa Cabaret]]''. He also hosted Melbourne's [[Carols by Candlelight]] and Sydney's [[The Domain, Sydney|Carols in the Domain]].

Jackman's early film work includes ''[[Erskineville Kings]]'' and ''[[Paperback Hero (1999 film)|Paperback Hero]]'' (1999), and his television work includes ''[[Law of the Land]]'', ''[[Halifax f.p.]]'', ''[[Blue Heelers]]'', and ''[[The Man from Snowy River (TV series)|Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River]]''.

===''Oklahoma!''===
Jackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s acclaimed stage production of ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].<ref name="bravo"/> The performance earned him an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said "I totally felt like it can't get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career."<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book |first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=89|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit, Michigan|isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}</ref> He also starred in the [[Oklahoma! (1999 film)|1999 film version of the same stage musical]], which has been screened in many countries.

===''X-Men''===
[[File:HughJackmanApr09b.jpg|thumb|upright|Jackman at the ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' premiere, April 2009.]]
In 1999, Jackman was cast as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), replacing [[Dougray Scott]]. His co-stars included [[Patrick Stewart]], [[James Marsden]], [[Famke Janssen]], and [[Ian McKellen]]. According to a [[CBS]] interview in November 2006, Jackman's wife [[Deborra-Lee Furness]] told him not to take the role, a comment she later told him she was glad he ignored.{{citation needed | date = October 2012}}

Wolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but a lot of emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched [[Clint Eastwood]] in the [[Dirty Harry (film series)|''Dirty Harry'' movies]] and [[Mel Gibson]] in [[Mad Max 2|''Road Warrior'']]. "Here were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it."<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book |first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|pages=90–91|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}</ref> Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of [[Mike Tyson]] fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty."<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book |first=|title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=91|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}</ref>

Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned."<ref name="Biography Today"/>

Jackman, at 1.89m (6&nbsp;ft 2.5 inches),<ref name="Height">{{cite web |work=imdb.com |title=Hugh Jackman |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/bio |accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref> stands 30&nbsp;cm taller than Wolverine, who is said in the original comic book to be {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}}.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Wolverine_(James_Howlett) Marvel Universe: Wolverine (James Howlett)] ''Marvel.com''</ref> Hence, the filmmakers were frequently forced to shoot Jackman at unusual angles or only from the waist up to make him appear shorter than he actually is, and his co-stars wore platform soles. Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the fourth film in the series, he bench-pressed over 136&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fleming |first=Michael |date=December 2008 |title=''Playboy'' Interview: Hugh Jackman |journal=Playboy |page= 62}}</ref>

Jackman reprised his role in 2003's ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', 2006's ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', and the 2009 prequel ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', although [[Troye Sivan]] played the younger version of James Howlett. He also [[cameo appearance|cameo]]ed as Wolverine in 2011's ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. He returned for the role of Wolverine again in 2013's ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'', a stand-alone sequel taking place after the events of ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', and reprised the character in the 2014 sequel ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''. In 2015, Jackman announced that the upcoming 2017 sequel to ''The Wolverine'' will be the final time he plays the role.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Hugh Jackman Is Walking Away From Wolverine|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Hugh-Jackman-Walking-Away-From-Wolverine-71336.html|accessdate=May 8, 2015|publisher=Cinema Blend|date=May 7, 2015}}</ref>

===2003–2008 (films)===
After 2003's ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', Jackman played the title role of monster killer [[Gabriel Van Helsing]] in the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]''.<ref name="bravo"/> Jackman and the film were noted in Bruce A. McClelland's book ''Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead''.

Jackman was one of the choices to play [[James Bond]] in 2006's ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', but eventually lost out to [[Daniel Craig]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Walls |first=Jeannette |title=Call him Bland, James Bland |url=http://www.today.com/id/9546090 |accessdate=9 November 2013 |newspaper=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |date=18 October 2005}}</ref> Jackman starred in the 2006 film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'', directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] and co-starring [[Christian Bale]], [[Michael Caine]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. As Robert Angier, Jackman portrayed a magician who built up a rivalry with contemporary Alfred Borden in attempt to one-up each other in the art of deception. Jackman stated that his main reason for doing ''The Prestige'' was to work with musician [[David Bowie]], who played scientist [[Nikola Tesla]].

[[File:XMenOriginsWolverineCastPremiereApr09b.jpg|thumb|upright|Hugh Jackman and [[Ryan Reynolds]] (right) at the ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' premiere in Tempe, Arizona (2009)]]
Jackman portrayed three different characters in [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s science-fiction film ''[[The Fountain (film)|The Fountain]]'': Tommy Creo, a [[neuroscientist]], who is torn between his wife, Izzi ([[Rachel Weisz]]), who is dying of a [[brain tumor]], and his work at trying to cure her; Captain Tomas Creo, a Spanish [[conquistador]] in 1532 [[Seville]]; and a future astronaut, Tom, travelling to a golden nebula in an eco-spacecraft seeking to be reunited with Izzi. Jackman said ''The Fountain'' was his most difficult film thus far due to the physical and emotional demands of the part.

Jackman also starred in [[Woody Allen]]'s 2006 film ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'' opposite [[Scarlett Johansson]]. That year he also reprised the role of Wolverine in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. He rounded out 2006 with two animated films: ''[[Happy Feet]]'', directed by [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]], in which he voiced the part of Memphis, an [[emperor penguin]]; and ''[[Flushed Away]]'', where Jackman supplied the voice of a rat named Roddy who ends up being flushed down a family's toilet into the London sewer system.

Of the movie, Jackman said, "This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself all the way through the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures.... I'll die a happy man knowing I've got this film on my [[curriculum vitae|CV]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Paul|title=Big Down Under|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/big-down-under-27895383.html|accessdate=9 November 2013|newspaper=[[Evening Herald]]|date=11 December 2008}}</ref>
