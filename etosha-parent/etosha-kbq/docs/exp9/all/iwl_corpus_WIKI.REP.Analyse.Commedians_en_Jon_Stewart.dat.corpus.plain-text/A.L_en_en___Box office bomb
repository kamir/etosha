In the [[motion picture industry]], a '''box office bomb''' or '''flop''' is a film that is viewed as highly unsuccessful or unprofitable during its theatrical run, sometimes preceding hype regarding its cost, production, or marketing efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/greatestflops.html |title=Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref><ref name="cnbc.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/38815985/The_15_Biggest_Box_Office_Bombs |title=The 15 Biggest Box Office Bombs |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> Generally, any film for which the production and marketing costs exceed the combined revenue recovered after release is considered to have "bombed".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theforrester.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/top-220-biggest-box-office-bombs-wost-movies-with-respect-to-box-office-gross/ |title=Top 200 Biggest Box Office Bombs.

Gauging the financial success of a film is difficult, and because there is no reliable definition, what makes a ''box-office bomb'' can be very subjective. Not all films that fail to earn back their estimated costs during their theatrical runs are bombs,<ref name="cnbc.com"/> and the label is generally applied to films that miss earnings projections by a wide margin, particularly when they are [[List of most expensive films|very expensive to produce]], and sometimes in conjunction with middling or poor reviews (though critical reception has an imperfect connection to box office performance).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/as-battleship-flops-ten-other-memorable-box-office-bombs-20120521 |title=As 'Battleship' Flops: Ten Other Memorable Box-Office Bombs &#124; The Playlist |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |date=1995-12-22 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>

==Possible success of some so-called "flops"==
If a studio recoups the production by the theatrical markets (and marketing costs by the [[ancillary market]]) of a film, then it can be considered a success. Otherwise, if it does not recoup, it is referred to as a ''box office bomb''. But some films, though international distribution, sales to [[television syndication]], and home video releases often mean some films that are considered flops in North America eventually make a profit for their studios. ''[[Waterworld]]'' is an example of a movie that does not appear on lists of box office bombs, despite enormous budget overruns, because the film broke even after making huge revenues from foreign box office, rentals, [[pay-per-view]] fees, cable outlays, and other [[revenue stream]]s that exist independently of the North American theatrical system.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |title=Isn’t It Time To Take ‘Waterworld’ Off The All-Time Flop List? |date=August 7, 2013 |work=Deadline.com |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/isnt-it-time-to-take-waterworld-off-the-all-time-flop-list |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'', a [[1968 in film|1968 film]] featuring [[The Monkees]], was a flop that became profitable for [[Columbia Pictures|its studio]] years later when its [[cult film]] status led to its sale to [[Rhino Entertainment]] and its re-release in various video formats. The popularity and profitability of DVD sales has added further opportunities for films to recoup losses and eventually become profitable, leading to doubts over the significance of US domestic grosses as a predictor of a film's overall success.

In 2012, ''[[Dredd]]'' earned $23,153,028 from international markets<ref>"Dredd (2012) - International Box Office Results". Box Office Mojo. Amazon.com. 11 November 2012. Archived from the original on 16 December 2012. Retrieved 16 December 2012.</ref> and $13,414,714 from North America, for a total of $36,567,742.<ref>"Dredd". Box Office Mojo. Amazon.com. 25 October 2012. Archived from the original on 28 April 2013. Retrieved 25 October 2012.</ref> ''Dredd ''was considered a flop on these returns. In the UK it grossed £1.05 million from 415 cinemas during its opening weekend. This made it the weekend's number-one film, the first film restricted to audiences over 18 years of age to do so since ''[[Saw 3D]]'' in 2010.<ref>Kemp, Stuart (11 September 2012). "Around-the-World Roundup: 'Expendables' Back on Top". Box Office Mojo (Amazon.com). Archived from the original on 13 September 2012.

Archived from the original on 13 September 2012. Retrieved 11 September 2012.</ref> In home media during its first week on sale in the UK, ''Dredd'' was the number 1 selling DVD and Blu-ray. During the week of its release in North America, it was the number 1 selling DVD and Blu-ray with approximately 650,000 units sold, and Blu-ray units accounting for nearly 50% of that figure. It was also the best-selling digital download for that period<ref>Trumbdore, Dave (22 January 2013). "Dredd Tops Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Download Sales". Collider. Archived from the original on 22 January 2013. Retrieved 22 January 2013.</ref> bringing it into profit, and it also sold out from many retailers due to lack of expected sales demand based on the box office performance compared to actual demand for it on home media, showing non box office returns of films is important in considering if a film is a flop.

''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', based on [[Northern Lights (novel)|the first novel]] in [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series, is considered a flop in North America due to its $180 million budget coupled with New Line Cinema's decision to sell all of the international distribution rights, but the unique circumstances of its international success have made the film's overall success a point of contention; it was the first film ever to make more than $300 million internationally but less than $100 million in the United States. Then–New Line studio co-head [[Michael Lynne]] said, "The jury is still very much out on the movie..."<ref>{{cite news | author=Peter Sanders | url= | title=New Line and Director Settle 'Rings' Suit, Look to 'Hobbit' | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=2007-12-19 }}</ref>

===Different standards of success===
Different genres of film are subject to different standards of success. Action movies typically have higher production costs and promotion budgets than romantic movies. Typically, the most notorious flops are summer [[Blockbuster motion picture|blockbusters]], which often incur enormous production costs in a highly competitive market, but do not perform well at the box office. The 2004 film ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' was released in July of that year to poor reviews, and went on to gross $40,202,379 domestically against a budget of $100 million. Advertising and marketing costs not included in a film's production costs can make a bomb even more harmful to the studio.

==Studios pushed into financial trouble==
In extreme cases, a single film's lackluster performance can push a studio into financial losses, [[bankruptcy]] or [[Closure (business)|closure]], as happened with [[RKO Pictures]] (''[[The Conqueror (film)|The Conqueror]]''), [[United Artists]] (''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''), [[Carolco Pictures]] (''[[Cutthroat Island]]'', once listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the biggest box office flop of all time<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051127180839/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50762 |archivedate=2005-11-27 |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50762 |title=Guinness World Records |publisher=guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2005-11-27 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref>), [[Fox Animation Studios]] (''[[Titan A.E.]]''), [[The Ladd Company]] (''[[Twice Upon a Time (1983 film)|Twice Upon a Time]]'' and ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''),  [[Fleischer Studios]] (''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]''), [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[Once Upon a Forest]]''), and [[ITC Entertainment]] (''[[Raise The Titanic (film)|Raise the Titanic]]''). The failure of ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' was seen as a significant factor in influencing [[Warner Bros.]]' decision to take direct control of [[New Line Cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Erik |url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2008/02/28/breaking-new-line-cinema-says-goodbye/ |title='''Cinematical''': BREAKING: New Line Cinema Says Goodbye! |publisher=Cinematical.com |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref>

When a failed attempt to revive a genre is particularly costly, all studios may subsequently balk at producing similar films, as was the case with [[Gold Circle Films]]' horror-comedy ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'', which made less than a quarter of its $29.5 million budget. Some failures have changed a company's agenda, such as [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' decision to make only computer-animated features, which stemmed from several disappointing [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] releases, including ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' and ''[[Treasure Planet]]''. (However, this decision was reversed a few years later.) Due to the box office disappointments of the films ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'', ''[[The Iron Giant]]'', ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', and ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', [[Warner Bros. Animation]] shifted from theatrical features to television shows; however, recently it has produced some ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical shorts and eventually returned to making films with ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' in 2014 under the Warner Animation Group banner, which was met with critical acclaim and became a major box office success. 

In 2001, [[Square Pictures]] released its first film, ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', an animated motion picture inspired by the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series of video games. It received mixed reviews from critics and it lost over $52 million, and Square Pictures ceased producing feature films. In 2011, ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' was the last film released by [[ImageMovers#Disney era|ImageMovers Digital]] before it got absorbed by ImageMovers to a loss of nearly $140 million—the largest box office loser of all time unadjusted for inflation.  Despite this loss, the decision to close the production company had been made a year prior to the film's release.<ref name="deadline">{{cite news | first=Nikki | last=Finke | url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/03/disney-closing-zemeckis-digital-studio-in-2011/ | title=Disney Closing Zemeckis' Digital Studio | publisher=[[Deadline.com]] | date=2010-03-12 | accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref>

==Causes of a film's failure==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}

===Negative word of mouth===
Beginning in the 1980s, cinemas started to drop movies that suffered a poor opening weekend.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} This made the performance of a film on its opening weekend much more crucial to its perception. With the growth of the Internet during the 1990s, chat rooms and websites enabled negative word of mouth to spread rapidly. The 1998 movie ''[[The Siege]]'' was originally a critical and commercial failure after Muslim and Arab organizations ridiculed it over its insensitive matter.

A troubled production history is sometimes also the case, as it was with ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which famously went three months over schedule and saw its budget mushroom from $7.5 million to $36 million. These facts caught the ears of journalists and critics who were refused access to the film's set by director [[Michael Cimino]], and upon its release was abhorred by the American press. (Such a predicament would have occurred for ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' had the film not been received so warmly at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].)

===Competition===
Films may attract low ticket sales if they are released against heavy competition from other movies also in theaters at the same time. A notable example of this was the 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. The film was a financial loss for RKO because it was pitted against the highly successful films ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' and ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''. However, it became largely popular during the television era, and is now considered a Christmas classic.

===External circumstances===
While it is rare, films which might otherwise have fared well may fail due to issues unrelated to the film itself, with the timing of the film's release being perhaps the most common. This was one of several reasons for the commercial failure of one of Hollywood's first flops, ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''. Due to production delays, the film was not released until late 1916, by which time the [[United States non-interventionism#20th century non-intervention|widespread anti-war sentiment]] it reflected had started to shift in favor of U.S. entry into [[World War I]]. While the film would later be considered groundbreaking, its failure drove [[D. W. Griffith]]'s production company, Triangle Studio, out of business. Other examples include [[Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer|MGM]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''[[Bambi]]'' all of which underperformed merely due to the fact they were released during World War II, which cut off 60% of Hollywood's international release market. However, these films became popular and critically acclaimed in later years, especially the former, which has gone on to become one of the most iconic films in film history.

Other issues such as general economic malaise may cause less [[disposable income]] for potential filmgoers, resulting in fewer ticket sales. Also, many movies that open during times of national crisis and just after disasters such as [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], and hurricanes underperform at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeguru.com/091701.htm |title=Weekend Box Office |publisher=Boxofficeguru.com |date=2001-09-17 |url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news/marvel-prez-to-head-disney-8057|accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref>

===High production costs===
Sometimes, a film may do reasonably well at the box office, but still be considered a failure due to a large budget.  For example, 2005's ''[[Sahara (2005 film)|Sahara]]'' cost over $241 million to make, due in part to exorbitant production costs. It took in $122 million, usually enough to be successful.  However, in this case, this accounted for barely over half of its expenses.<ref>Glenn F. Bunting, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/05/business/fi-cussler5 Jurors hear tales of studio maneuvering], ''Los Angeles Times'', March 5, 2007</ref> In 2012, Disney reported losses of $200 million on ''[[John Carter (film)|John Carter]]''; at that time the film had made only $234 million worldwide, far short of the $250 million budget plus worldwide advertising.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17442200 | work=BBC News | title=John Carter flop to cost Walt Disney $200m | date=2012-03-20}}</ref>

==Independent films==
The 2006 independent movie ''[[Zyzzyx Road]]'' made just $30 at the domestic box office. The film, with a budget of $1.2 million and starring [[Tom Sizemore]] and [[Katherine Heigl]], owes its tiny revenue to its limited box office release—just six days in a single theater in [[Dallas]] for the purpose of meeting [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]] requirements—rather than its ability to attract viewers.<ref name="CHUD">{{cite news

(2011) |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=worstmovieever.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref>

===Publicly financed films===
The critically acclaimed Canadian film ''[[The Law of Enclosures (film)|The Law of Enclosures]]'' (1999) took in about C$1,000 at the box office due to an extremely limited release in 2001. The movie was exhibited in only one theater in Toronto for exactly one week. Costing C$2 million, ''Law'' won three [[Genie Award]] nominations, including nods to its stars [[Sarah Polley]] and [[Brendan Fletcher]] (Fletcher won). The film was publicly financed due to Canadian legislation mandating the production of [[Canadian content|Canadian-content]] films to compete with films imported from the United States, which dominates the Canadian box office. Despite the praise and the participation of the Oscar-nominated Polley, a major movie star in Canada, the film was a flop at the box office and was not released on DVD.
