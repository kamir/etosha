'''Elliott Kalan''' is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]] and the head writer for ''[[The Daily Show]] with [[Jon Stewart]]''.

Kalan grew up in [[Millburn, New Jersey]] and graduated from [[Millburn High School]] as part of the class of 1999.<ref>Staff. [http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2009/11/danielle_friedman_to_wed_ellio.html "Danielle Friedman to wed Elliott Kalan, a Millburn High School graduate"], ''Independent Press'', November 12, 2009. Accessed March 24, 2015. "The future groom is a graduate of Millburn High School, Class of 1999, and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts."</ref> He attended [[Tisch School of the Arts]], where he majored in screenwriting at the Rita & Burton Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing. Kalan lives in [[New York City]], where he began at ''The Daily Show'' as a production assistant in 2003 before moving up to producer, staff writer, and ultimately head writer.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Megh|title='The Daily Show' Promotes Elliott Kalan to Head Writer|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/01/the-daily-show-promotes-elliott-kalan-to-head-writer/|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Splitsider|date=28 January 2014}}</ref>

Kalan was co-founder of comedy group The Hypocrites with fellow TV writer Brock Mahan.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hypocrites|url=http://www.brockandelliott.com/|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>  He also hosted a live talk/variety stage show, ''The Primetime Kalan'' (originally ''The Midnight Kalan'' and later ''The New Kalan Show''). The show was created by Kalan, producer [[Erik Marcisak]], and director [[Joe Guercio]], and written and performed by Kalan, Marcisak, and [[Dan McCoy]]. Many of Kalan's ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' co-workers appeared on his show, including [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Samantha Bee]], and [[Rob Corddry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Notes from The Primetime Kalan 9.9.5|url=http://www.theapiary.org/archives/2005/09/recap_the_prime.html|work=The Apiary|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>    

Kalan occasionally appears in bit parts on ''The Daily Show'' and provided voice-over narration for "The Decider" comic-book segments. He was instrumental in putting together the "gay cowboy" montage (a comedic series of clips from classic westerns, illustrating that the gay content in ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' is nothing new), when [[Jon Stewart]] hosted the [[78th Academy Awards]]. 

From 2006 to 2009, Kalan wrote a weekly column for the free morning daily ''[[Metro International|Metro]]''. Following a column he wrote in the August 3, 2007 issue of the Metro, Kalan was fired for writing a self-deprecating joke about the increasing obsolescence of the newspaper industry. This was followed by a brief article in [[New York Magazine]] on August 20, 2007 about the incident,<ref>{{cite news|last=Rosenblum|first=Emma|title='Metro' Columnist Elliott Kalan Fired for Declaring Newspapers Dead|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/35820/|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=13 August 2007}}</ref> which was heavily publicized on internet blogs including [[Media Bistro]], [[Huffington Post]], and [[Gawker]]. Many blog postings about the incident imply that the Metro violated basic principles of journalism and freedom of expression in firing Kalan. Perhaps as a result of this publicity, he was later re-hired. In 2009, he left the Metro of his own accord, saying "Why leave now?  It just feels like the right time for me to move on creatively. Or I’m going undercover to deliver Osama bin Laden to justice. Pick whichever reason sounds cooler."

Kalan also performs as a stand-up comic, and in 2013 performed several [[USO]] shows in Afghanistan along with [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]], [[Rory Albanese]], and Adam Lowitt.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Oliver Leads 'The Daily Show' Comedians on Overseas USO Tour|url=http://www.uso.org/the-daily-show-john-oliver-uso-tour-2013-photos/|work=USO|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>

Along with comedians [[Dan McCoy]] and [[Stuart Wellington]], Kalan co-hosts [[The Flop House]] podcast, on which the hosts discuss and mock major movies that received poor reviews from critics, such as ''[[Gamer (film)|Gamer]]'' and ''[[All About Steve]]''. One supplemental episode of the Flop House, in which Kalan improvised a rapid-fire pitch for a film based on the comic [[Ziggy (comic strip)|Ziggy]] became a minor viral Internet success after being posted on [[Gawker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Astoundingly Good Case For Making A Ziggy Movie|url=http://gawker.com/381641/the-astoundingly-good-case-for-making-a-ziggy-movie|work=Gawker}}</ref> Dan McCoy and Kalan have also been published in comedy magazine ''[[Whim Quarterly]]'' and film zine ''[[I Love Bad Movies]]''.

From early 2009 until April 2012, Kalan hosted the screening series Closely Watched Films<ref>{{cite web|last=Ott|first=John|title=Closely Watching Million Dollar Legs|url=http://makingthemovie.info/2010/06/closely-watching-million-dollar-legs.html|work=Making the Movie|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref> at [[92YTribeca]]. These events commonly featured the screening of a rare older film followed by a discussion between Kalan and a celebrity guest who had not previously seen the film.

Kalan lives in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] with his wife Danielle and his son Sammy, along with his fellow co-hosts on [[The Flop House]].
