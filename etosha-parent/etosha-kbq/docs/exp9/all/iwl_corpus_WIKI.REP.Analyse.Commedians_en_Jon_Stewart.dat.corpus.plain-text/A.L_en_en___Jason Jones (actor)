===''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''===
In September 2005, Jones joined the Daily Show cast as a contributor. When his wife left the show in late December for [[family leave]], Jones was promoted to a full-time correspondent. Thereafter, he won a significant following at ''The Daily Show'', thanks to a few pieces on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Denmark cartoons]], [[Carl Monday]], and [[Laguna Beach]]. Before [[Rob Corddry]] left ''The Daily Show'', he said: "Jason Jones has raised the bar too high. I just can't say the things he says to people."<ref>http://www.phelpshawkins.com/2006.08.01_arch.html</ref> His exposé on the real values of [[Wasilla, Alaska]] remains one of the most popular pieces on the ''Daily Show'' website. In 2014, Jones temporarily left ''The Daily Show'' to appear in a pilot for the sitcom ''Love Is Relative''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nypost.com/2014/03/19/jason-jones-leaving-the-daily-show/|title=Jason Jones latest ‘Daily Show’ comedian moving to sitcoms|work=[[New York Post]]|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>

In June 2009, Jones was sent to Tehran just prior to the [[2009 Iranian election protests|controversial 2009 presidential election]].<ref>http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=230115&title=irandecision-2009-election&byDate=true</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/daily-show-sends-reporter-to-iran|work=The New York Times|title='Daily Show' Sends Reporter to Iran|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> Jones' reports in Iran included an interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'' journalist [[Maziar Bahari]], who was arrested after the disputed June 2009 presidential elections. During Bahari's time in prison, his interrogators charged him with espionage and used Jones' interview as evidence against him. It was later clarified by Bahari that the charges were fabricated.<ref name="newsweek-118">{{cite web|title=Newsweek Reporter's Ordeal in Iran|author=Bahari, Maziar|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/223862|publisher=Newsweek|page=5|accessdate=December 1, 2009|archivedate=December 1, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lgsqODyd}}</ref> Jones appeared as himself in the film version of Bahari's ordeal, ''[[Rosewater (film)|Rosewater]]'', encountering Bahari prior to taping their interview. The film was written and directed by ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' host [[Jon Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2752688/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=Rosewater (2014)|work=IMDB.com|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref> 

On October 7, 2014, Jones filled in for Jon Stewart, who was sick that night. He also disclosed on that episode that he had recently become an American citizen. 

Jason Jones announced that he would leave The Daily Show in 2015 to begin work on his untitled TBS show which he co-wrote and will executive produce with wife Samantha Bee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2015/02/jason-jones-leaving-the-daily-show-1201380582/|author=Lisa de Moraes|title=Jason Jones Officially Leaving ‘Daily Show’, Samantha Bee Remains – Update|website=[[Deadline.com]]|date=February 24, 2015|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}</ref>

===2014 Sochi Olympics===
Jason Jones was sent as a mock reporter to cover the [[2014 Sochi Olympics]]. Through his visit, Jones often lampooned Russian culture and its perceived police state. For example, in one episode, Jones attempted to find a protest area in [[Sochi]] and was forced to drive well outside of the city to an abandoned parking lot which was designed as the zone for protesters; however, even then he was approached by police officers and asked to leave due to not having appropriate documentation. During Jason Jones's interview with opposition figure [[Alexei Navalny]], the crew's cameras and other electronic equipment was jammed as they entered an apartment to conduct the interview. Jones also managed to hold a mock interview with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] where he insisted Gorbachev put up the wall, a play on president [[Ronald Reagan]]'s plea to Gorbachev to "tear down that wall." Alexei Navalny was arrested several days after conducting the interview with Jason Jones, which was also satirized by [[Jon Stewart]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/30gza6/jason-jones-live-from-sochi-ish---no-safety-nyet|title=Jason Jones Live From Sochi-ish - No Safety Nyet|publisher=[[The Daily Show]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>
