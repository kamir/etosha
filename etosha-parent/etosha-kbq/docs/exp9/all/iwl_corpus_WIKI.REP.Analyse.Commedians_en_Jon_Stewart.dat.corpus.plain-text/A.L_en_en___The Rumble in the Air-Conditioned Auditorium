'''The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium: O'Reilly vs. Stewart 2012''' is a [[debate]] between [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' and [[Jon Stewart]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and moderated by [[CNN]] news anchor [[E. D. Hill]]. It took place on October 6, 2012 in [[Washington, D.C.]], starting at 8 pm with most of its audience viewing via [[Internet stream]] and subsequent download.<ref name=post>{{Cite web|last=Adams |first=Cindy |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/no_spin_just_fun_for_charity_lDUXOvUgfKPdquZrDnkZfK |title=If you like Bill O’Reilly, read this. Don’t like him, read it anyway |publisher=NYPOST.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', O'Reilly and Stewart "have been guests on each other’s programs since 2001" but "rarely agree on anything except their mutual respect for each other."<ref name=nytblog>{{Cite web|last=Hautman|first=Emmarie|title=Stewart and O’Reilly Share Stage in Political Joust|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/stewart-and-oreilly-share-stage-in-political-joust/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref> 

The name of the event evokes the 1974 boxing match [[the Rumble in the Jungle]];<ref>''Haaretz'': [http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-elections-2012/as-u-s-elections-inch-closer-one-debate-promises-some-comic-relief-1.465425 As U.S. elections inch closer, one debate promises some comic relief].

The format of the debate was broken up into two sections: the first half followed the usual "presidential debate" format, while for the second half, the three took seats closer to the audience and answered questions posted by the audience and viewers on the Internet. While the discussion topics were essentially the same as the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|presidential debate a few days prior]], much of the event was laced with humour: an oft reused gag was the notable height difference between {{height|ft=6|in=4}} O'Reilly and the {{height|ft=5|in=7}} Stewart – to compensate, Stewart had a mechanical riser built into his podium, which he would often use for comic effect.

==Viewing==
Promotional posters had explicitly announced, "It's why [[Al Gore and information technology#1999 CNN interview|Al Gore invented the Internet]]." A live internet stream and downloadable video files were offered for $4.95, with O'Reilly and Stewart donating half of the net profits to a number of charitable causes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium – Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.therumble2012.com/f/faq|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref> The day after the debate was announced, tickets to attend the event live at the [[Lisner Auditorium]] at [[George Washington University]] were sold out.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Auditorium |first=Lisner |url=http://www.lisner.org/eventdetails.asp?id=751|title=GW Lisner Auditorium Box Office|publisher=GW Lisner Auditorium |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref> 

Technical troubles arose at the start of the debate, preventing thousands of users from being able to watch the event live. The event's Facebook page cited overwhelming demand as the cause. Many were outraged since they sold the online tickets beforehand and were still unprepared. Nox Solutions was cited as the company providing streaming services for the event.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cirilli|first=Kevin|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82113.html|title=Tech glitch hits Jon Stewart-Bill O’Reilly debate|date=October 6, 2012|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref>

''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: "It may not have been the most important debate of the 2012 presidential election season but it was certainly, so far, the most entertaining."<ref>"Jon Stewart-Bil O'Reilly debate brings the humor" by Carol Memmott and Lindsay Deutsch, ''USA Today'', October 8, 2012, [http://www.ksdk.com/news/article/342131/71/OReilly-Stewart-rumble-debate-brings-the-humor- Retrieved 2012-10-08]</ref>

The ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' wrote of the event: "O'Reilly and Stewart attacked each other's arguments but not their personalities, armed with facts and a fair bit of passion. They didn't replace traditional news sources or change many minds, but they did offer a blueprint for debate that can inform, entertain and push forward the bounds of public discussion at once."<ref>"Review: Jon Stewart and Bill O'Reilly's 'Rumble'" by Eric Deggans, ''Tampa Bay Times'' [http://www.tampabay.com/features/media/article1255335.ece Retrieved 2012-10-08]</ref>

At a post-debate press conference, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted that Stewart "resisted attempts to analyze the meaning and influence of the event" and that he had similarly maintained his 2010 "[[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|Rally to Restore Sanity]]" was purely for entertainment value.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|title=The Stewart-O’Reilly Debate: An Inside View of a Seriously Hilarious Rumble|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/07/the-stewart-oreilly-debate-an-inside-view-of-a-seriously-hilarious-rumble/|accessdate=October 7, 2012|newspaper=Time|date=October 7, 2012}}</ref>

The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' described The Rumble as "a giant promotion to attract more followers" to ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' on Comedy Central and ''The O’Reilly Factor'' on ''Fox News''" with the potential to serve as [[infotainment]] that would raise civic engagement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Terry|first=Allison|title=The Bill O'Reilly-Jon Stewart 'rumble': More than a jab-fest?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2012/1006/The-Bill-O-Reilly-Jon-Stewart-rumble-More-than-a-jab-fest|accessdate=October 7, 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> However, Nicholas Sywak of [[Salon.com]] felt the entertainment value was lacking and that it was "barely worth $4.95, much less a Saturday night."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sywak|first=Nicholas|title=The Rumble 2012: Jon Stewart steamrolls Bill O'Reilly|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/07/the_rumble_2012_jon_stewart_steamrolls_bill_oreilly_in_their_first_on_stage_debate/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref>
