===1995 photographer incident===
In October 1995, Baldwin allegedly assaulted a photographer for videotaping his wife, [[Kim Basinger]], and their 3-day-old daughter. The couple was returning from the hospital and were confronted by the photographer outside their Los Angeles home. [[Whoopi Goldberg]] praised Baldwin for his actions during her opening monologue while hosting the [[68th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-27/local/me-61811_1_alec-baldwin|title=Alec Baldwin Arrested in Battery on Photographer|date=October 27, 1995 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=March 27, 2014|first=Nicholas|last=Riccardi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/special/l96os054.htm|title=Sassy Whoopi takes charge|date=March 26, 1996 |work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

===Runway incident===
In December 2011, Baldwin was on an [[American Airlines]] flight at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], playing ''[[Words with Friends]]'' on his phone while waiting for takeoff. When instructed to put away the "electronic device" by the flight attendant, he reportedly became belligerent and was eventually removed from the plane. He later publicly apologized to the passengers who were delayed, but not to the airline or federal regulators.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK "Alec Baldwin thrown off AA flight at LAX for 'playing game' on phone"]. ''New York Post''.</ref>

A 2012 commercial for [[Capital One]] credit cards, for which Baldwin is a spokesperson, makes humorous reference to the event: a [[Viking]] character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies that it is not to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding "No!" A commercial for [[Best Buy]] also humorously referenced the event: Words With Friends co-creators Paul Bettner and David Bettner are on a plane and are interrupted by a flight attendant looking down at them, clearing her throat and signaling them to put their phones away.

Baldwin also made a guest appearance on ''Saturday Night Live''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Weekend Update]] segment, posing as the captain of the plane from which he was removed.

===''A Promise to Ourselves''===
In 2008, Baldwin and Mark Tabb published their book ''A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce'', which chronicles Baldwin's seven-year battle to remain a part of his daughter's life.<ref name="Baldwin 2008"/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://mensnewsdaily.com/2009/01/02/alec-baldwin-a-promise-to-ourselves/ | title= Alec Baldwin: A Promise to Ourselves | first = Mike | last= LaSalle | publisher=MensNewsDaily.com | date = January 2, 2009 | archivedate= February 24, 2009 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090224013447/http://mensnewsdaily.com/2009/01/02/alec-baldwin-a-promise-to-ourselves/}}</ref>

Baldwin contends that after their separation in December 2000, his former wife, [[Kim Basinger]], endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting,<ref>Baldwin 2008. p25.</ref> blocking visitation,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp 71, 117, 150–51, 153, 166, 169.</ref> not providing telephone access,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 43, 71, 127, 153–54, 178, 180.</ref> not following court orders,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 117, 155, 165, 175–77.</ref> not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience,<ref>Baldwin 2008</ref> and directly lobbying the child.<ref>Baldwin 2008. p. 66.</ref> He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 185, 202.</ref> Baldwin called this [[parental alienation]] syndrome.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 75–94.</ref>

Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case "opportunists", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists as part of the "divorce industry". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, "In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever."<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 215–216.</ref>

Baldwin wrote that he has spent over a million dollars,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 202–03.</ref> has had to put time aside from his career,<ref>Baldwin 2008. p. 99, 102.</ref> has had to travel extensively,<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 41, 45, 151–53.</ref> and needed to find a house in [[California]] (he lived in New York),<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 44, 47, 117.</ref> so that he could stay in his daughter's life.<ref name="Baldwin 2008" />

Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his daughter a "rude, thoughtless little pig".<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 173–184.</ref> He contends that the tape was sold to [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 178–179.</ref> Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 101, 151.</ref> He later admitted to ''[[Playboy]]'' in June 2009 that he contemplated [[suicide]] over the voicemail that leaked to the public. Of the incident he said, "I spoke to a lot of professionals, who helped me. If I committed suicide, [ex-wife Kim Basinger's side] would have considered that a victory. Destroying me was their avowed goal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Alec-Baldwin-Suicide-1006923.aspx|title=Alec Baldwin Says He Considered Suicide Over "Rude Pig" Voicemail|work=TV Guide|accessdate=June 16, 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uFXhnbN6 |archivedate = November 14, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Stalking incident===
On April 8, 2012, a 40-year-old [[French-Canadian]] actress, Genevieve Sabourin, was arrested outside Baldwin and his wife's [[Greenwich Village]] apartment house and charged with aggravated harassment and stalking. She was released without bail and told not to contact Baldwin. Prosecutors said she and Baldwin had met on a film set more than 10 years earlier, and that beginning in 2011 she began sending him multiple unwanted emails and texts.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-canadian-actress-genevieve-sabourin-stalked-alec-baldwin-article-1.1058561  |title=Alec Baldwin stalked by Canadian actress Genevieve Sabourin in New York City, Hamptons: cops | first= Rocco |last= Parascandola | first2=Christina | last2=Boyle| first3=Tracy|last3=Connor |location=New York|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date= April 9, 2012 | accessdate= 2014-05-13}}</ref>

During his appearance on the comedy late night show ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 11, 1998, eight days before President [[Bill Clinton]] was to be [[Clinton impeachment|impeached]], Baldwin said, "If we were in another country ... we would stone [[Henry Hyde]] to death and we would go to their homes and kill their wives and their children.

Baldwin said in a 2006 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that if he did become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for [[Governor of New York]]. When asked if he was qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself more qualified than California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name="Getting In on the Sitcom Act"/> In June 2011, ''[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]]'' reported that Baldwin was mulling over a 2013 run for [[Mayor of New York City]] in the wake of a potential early race shake-up after candidate Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]]'s [[sexting]] scandal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/06/08/060811-news-alec-baldwin-1-2/|title=Political Smart Alec|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=August 20, 2011|first=Richard|last=Johnson|work=[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]]}}</ref> However, on December 21, 2011, Baldwin said he was abandoning plans to run for the office and would instead continue in his role on ''30 Rock''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/alec-baldwin-rules-2013-mayoral-campaign-article-1.995075|title=Alec Baldwin rules out 2013 NYC mayoral campaign|date=December 21, 2011|accessdate=December 23, 2011|first=Richard|last=Johnson|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York}}</ref>

In February 2009, Baldwin spoke out to encourage state leaders to renew New York's tax break for the film and television industry, stating that if the "tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget, film production in this town is going to collapse and television production is going to collapse and it's all going to go to California".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/94633/alec-baldwin-calls-on-governor-to-extend-tax-credit/Default.aspx|title=Alec Baldwin Calls on Governor To Extend Tax Credit|publisher=[[NY1]]|date=February 26, 2009|accessdate=August 20, 2011}}</ref>

During the 2011 Emmy Awards, Baldwin was slated to appear in a taped skit. However, the producers of the show cut a portion of the skit containing a reference to [[Rupert Murdoch]] and the [[News International phone hacking scandal]]. Baldwin subsequently boycotted the Emmy Awards and requested that his entire appearance be removed from the broadcast.
