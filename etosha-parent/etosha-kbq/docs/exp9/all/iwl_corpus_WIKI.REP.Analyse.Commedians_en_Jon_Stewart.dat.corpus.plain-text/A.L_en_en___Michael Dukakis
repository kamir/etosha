'''Michael Stanley Dukakis''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ʉ|ˈ|k|ɑː|k|ɨ|s}}; born November 3, 1933) served as the 65th and 67th Governor of [[Massachusetts]], from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991 respectively. He is the longest-serving Governor in Massachusetts history and only the second [[Greek American]] Governor in U.S. history, after [[Spiro Agnew]]. In 1988, he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States presidential election, 1988|nominee for President]], but lost to the  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, then–[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[George H. W. Bush]].

==Massachusetts governor==
===First governorship (1975–1979)===
{{Main|Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1974}}
After serving four terms in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] between 1962 and 1970 (and winning the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 1970<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/hri/dukakis.html |title=Michael S. Dukakis |publisher=Hri.org |date=1933-11-03 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>), Dukakis was elected governor in 1974, defeating the incumbent Republican [[Francis Sargent]] during a period of fiscal crisis. Dukakis won in part by promising to be a "reformer" and pledging a "lead pipe guarantee" of no new taxes to balance the state budget. He would later reverse his position after taking office. He also pledged to dismantle the powerful [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Metropolitan District Commission]] (MDC), a bureaucratic enclave that served as home to hundreds of political patronage employees. The MDC managed state parks, reservoirs, and waterways, as well as the highways and roads abutting those waterways. In addition to its own police force, the MDC had its own maritime patrol force, and an enormous budget from the state, for which it provided minimal accounting. Dukakis' efforts to dismantle the MDC failed in the legislature, where the MDC had many powerful supporters. As a result, the MDC would withhold its critical backing of Dukakis in the 1978 gubernatorial primary.

Governor Dukakis hosted [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Britain's Queen Elizabeth II]] during their visits to Boston in 1976 to commemorate the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial of the United States]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} He gained some notice as the only politician in the state government who went to work during the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of 1978]], during which he went to local TV studios in a sweater to announce emergency bulletins.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/02/03/have_we_learned_anything/?page=full |title= Have we learned anything?|author= Peter J. Howe |publisher=The Boston Globe |date =February 3, 2008}}</ref> Dukakis is also remembered for his 1977 [[exoneration]] of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]], two Italian anarchists whose trial sparked protests around the world.

During his first term in office, Dukakis [[Commutation of sentence|commuted the sentences]] of 21 first-degree murderers and 23 second-degree murderers. Due to controversy engendered by some of these individuals having re-offended, Dukakis curtailed the practice later, issuing no commutations in his last three years as governor.<ref>{{Cite news | title=If you thought Duke's commutations were bad, be warned: Patrick's could be so much worse | url=http://news.bostonherald.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=160964 | work=[[Boston Herald]] |publisher= |first=Howie |last=Carr | date=October 6, 2006 | accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

However, his first term performance proved to be insufficient to offset a backlash against the state's high sales and property tax rates, which turned out to be the predominant issue in the 1978 gubernatorial campaign. Dukakis, despite being the incumbent Democratic governor, was refused renomination by his own party. The [[Massachusetts Democratic Party|state's Democratic Party]] chose to support Director of the [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] [[Edward J. King]] in the [[primary election|primary]], partly because King rode the wave against high property taxes, but more significantly because state Democratic Party leaders lost confidence in Dukakis' ability to govern effectively. King also enjoyed the support of the power brokers at the MDC, who were unhappy with Dukakis' attempts to dismantle their powerful bureaucracy. King also had support from state police and public employee unions. Dukakis suffered a scathing defeat in the primary, a disappointment that his wife Kitty called "a public death".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1988-01-17/news/mn-36772_1_michael-dukakis|title=An Enigma: For Dukakis, Key Is Voter Perception|date=January 17, 1988|first=Bob|last=Drogin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

===Second governorship (1983–1991)===
{{Main|Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1982|Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1986}}
Four years later, having made peace with the state Democratic Party, MDC, the state police and public employee unions, Dukakis defeated King in a 're-match' in the 1982 Democratic primary. He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, [[John Winthrop Sears]], in the November election. Future United States Senator, 2004 Democratic Presidential nominee, and US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts|lieutenant governor]] on the same ballot with Dukakis, and served in the Dukakis administration from 1983 to 1985.

Dukakis served as governor during which time he presided over a high-tech boom and a period of prosperity in Massachusetts while simultaneously earning a reputation as a 'technocrat'.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The National Governors Association voted Dukakis the most effective governor in 1986. Residents of the city of [[Boston]] and its surrounding areas remember him for the improvements he made to Boston's [[public transport|mass transit]] system, especially major renovations to the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|city's trains and buses]]. He was known for riding the [[Rapid transit|subway]] to work every day as governor.<ref>{{Cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/us/boston-in-transit-war-against-uneasy-riding.html|title= Boston in transit war against uneasy riding|publisher=The New York Times |date = March 23, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url =http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/01/31/south-station-may-track-for-new-name-that-mike-dukakis/GBlBTJUC0HJDf94wKYN9yM/story.html|title= Will there be a new Duke at South Station?|author= Michael Levenson|publisher=The Boston Globe |date = January 31, 2014}}</ref>

In 1988, Dukakis and [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]], his economic adviser in the 1988 presidential elections, wrote a book entitled ''Creating the Future: the Massachusetts Comeback and Its Promise for America'', an examination of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]].<ref>Butterfield, Fox (May 1, 1988).[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/01/books/what-you-see-is-what-you-get.html?pagewanted=all "What you see is what you get"].

==1988 presidential campaign==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1988|Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1988}}
[[File:Dukakis1988rally.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Michael Dukakis at a campaign rally in [[UCLA]]'s [[Pauley Pavilion]], the night before the US presidential election of 1988 (Mon, 7 Nov 1988).]]
Using the phenomenon termed the "[[Massachusetts Miracle]]" to promote his campaign, Dukakis sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for [[President of the United States]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election]], prevailing over a primary field that included [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Dick Gephardt]], [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], [[Gary Hart]], [[Joe Biden]] and [[Al Gore]], among others. Touching on his immigrant roots, Dukakis used [[Neil Diamond]]'s ode to immigrants, "[[America (Neil Diamond song)|America]]", as the theme song for his campaign. Famed composer [[John Williams]] wrote "Fanfare for Michael Dukakis" in 1988 at the request of Dukakis's father-in-law, Harry Ellis Dickson. The piece was premiered under the baton of Dickson (then the Associate Conductor of the Boston Pops) at that year's [[1988 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, with 2,877 out of 4,105 delegates. He chose [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] of [[Texas]] to be his [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] running mate.  Dukakis was pro choice on the issue of abortion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldman |first=Ari L. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/07/us/dukakis-s-ties-to-orthodox-church-stay-warm-despite-abortion-stance.html |title=Dukakis's Ties to Orthodox Church Stay Warm Despite Abortion Stance |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1988-09-07 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>

Dukakis had trouble with the personality that he projected to the voting public. His reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion; Dukakis was often referred to as "[[Zorba the Greek|Zorba the Clerk]]". Nevertheless, Dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate with George Bush, but in the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and spent quite a bit of the day in bed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold. During the campaign, Dukakis's mental health became an issue when he refused to release his full medical history and there were, according to ''The New York Times'', "persistent suggestions" that he had undergone psychiatric treatment in the past.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html?pagewanted=all "Dukakis Releases Medical Details To Stop Rumors on Mental Health"], ''The New York Times'', August 4, 1988.</ref>  In the 2008 film ''[[Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story]]'', journalist [[Robert Novak]] revealed that Republican strategist [[Lee Atwater]] had personally tried to get him to spread these mental-health rumors.<ref name=BoogieMan>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/atwater/etc/script.html ''Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story''] transcript, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], director: Stefan Forbes, 2008.</ref>

Dukakis' general election campaign was subject to several criticisms and gaffes on issues such as capital punishment, the pledge of allegiance in schools, and most famously, the [[Michael Dukakis tank photograph|tank incident]]. Like the allegations of psychiatric problems, these were vulnerabilities which Atwater identified and exploited. In 1991, shortly before his death from a brain tumor, Atwater apologized to Dukakis for the "naked cruelty" of the 1988 campaign.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gravely Ill, Atwater Offers Apology |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/us/gravely-ill-atwater-offers-apology.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 13, 1991 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name="TNY20080505">{{cite journal |author=Dorothy Wickenden |title=Going Positive |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=May 5, 2008 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/05/05/080505taco_talk_wickenden |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Crime issues===
During the campaign, Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]], the Republican nominee, criticized Dukakis for his traditionally liberal positions on many issues, calling him "a card-carrying member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]". Dukakis' support for a prison [[furlough]] program was a major election subject. During his first term as Governor, he had vetoed a bill that would have stopped furloughs for first-degree murderers.<ref>Oshinsky, David. [http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/20/books/what-became-of-the-democrats.html?pagewanted=all "What Became of the Democrats"], ''The New York Times'' (October 20, 1991): "In 1976 the state legislature passed a bill that would have ended the furloughs of first-degree murderers. Governor Dukakis, as the Edsalls point out, vetoed it. A strong advocate of prisoners' rights, he contended that the bill would 'cut the heart out of efforts at inmate rehabilitation.'"</ref> During his second term, that program resulted in the release of convicted murderer [[Willie Horton|William "Willie" Horton]],<ref>''Crime, Risk and Insecurity" ed. Tim Hope and Richard Sparks, p. 266</ref> who committed a rape and assault in [[Maryland]] after being furloughed. [[George H. W. Bush]] mentioned Horton by name in a speech in June 1988, and a conservative [[political action committee]] (PAC) affiliated with the Bush campaign, the National Security Political Action Committee, aired an ad entitled "Weekend Passes", which used a [[mug shot]] image of Horton.  The Bush campaign refused to repudiate the ad. That [[advertising campaign|ad campaign]] was followed by a separate Bush campaign ad, "[[Revolving Door (television advertisement)|Revolving Door]]", criticizing Dukakis over the furlough program without mentioning Horton. The legislature canceled the program during Dukakis's last term.

The issue of capital punishment came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees. Because she knew the [[Willie Horton]] issue would be brought up, Dukakis's campaign manager, [[Susan Estrich]], had prepared with Michael Dukakis an answer highlighting the candidate's empathy for victims of crime, noting the beating of his father in a robbery and the death of his brother in a hit-and-run car accident.<ref name=estrich/> However, when [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]], the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, "Governor, if [[Kitty Dukakis]] [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" Dukakis replied, "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life", and explained his stance. After the debate,<ref name=estrich>Susan Estrich: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090510072124/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/9/27/103737.shtml The Debates]", [[Newsmax]] September 2004 (copy at the Internet Archive)</ref> many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the passion one would expect of a person discussing a loved one's rape and death. Many– including Dukakis himself– believe this, in part, cost him the election, as his poll numbers dropped from 49% to 42% nationally that night.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Other commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue and forced the candidate to make a difficult choice, while others believed that Dukakis dwelled too much on post-mortem reflections about this incident while the election was still in play in a way that was too self-effacing to the point of appearing self-pitying and defeatist, which only served to demoralize his campaign and reinforce the image of him as a weak leader.

===Tank photograph===
[[File:Michael_Dukakis_in_tank.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The photograph of Dukakis in an M1 Abrams tank from the US presidential election of 1988.]]
Dukakis was criticized during the campaign for a perceived softness on defense issues, particularly the controversial "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" program, which he promised to weaken. In response to this, Dukakis orchestrated what would become the key image of his campaign, although it turned out quite differently from what he intended. On September 13, 1988 Dukakis visited the [[General Dynamics]] Land Systems plant in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]] to take part in a [[photo op]] in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], had been photographed in a similar situation in 1986, riding in a [[Challenger 1 tank|Challenger]] tank while wearing a scarf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/features/tank.shtml |title=Radio4 - Today/The Fate of Tanks |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2014-10-03 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> Compared with Dukakis' results, Thatcher's picture was very successful and helped her reelection prospects.<ref>[http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html] {{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> Footage of Dukakis was used in television ads by the Bush campaign, as evidence that Dukakis would not make a good [[commander-in-chief]], and "Dukakis in the tank" remains shorthand for backfired [[public relations]] outings.<ref>[http://www.apoliticus.com/tag/george-bush/] {{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

===Outcome===
The Dukakis/Bentsen ticket lost the election by a decisive margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to George H.W. Bush and Dan Quayle, carrying only 10 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Dukakis himself blames his defeat on the time he spent doing gubernatorial work in Massachusetts during the few weeks following the Democratic Convention. Many believed he should have been campaigning across the country. During this time, his 17-point lead in opinion polls completely disappeared, as his lack of visibility allowed Bush to define the issues of the campaign. Dukakis has since stated that the main reason he lost was his decision "not to respond to the Bush attack campaign, and in retrospect it was a pretty dumb decision."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rizzo |first=John |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/dukakis-and-the-tank-99119_Page4.html |title=Dukakis and the Tank - Josh King - POLITICO Magazine |publisher=Politico.com |date=2013-11-17 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>

Despite Dukakis's loss, his performance was a marked improvement over the previous two Democratic efforts. Dukakis made some strong showings in states that had voted for Republicans [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. He managed to pull off a close win in [[New York]] which at the time was the second largest state in terms of electoral votes, he also scored victories in states like [[Rhode Island]], [[Hawaii]], and Dukakis's home state of Massachusetts; [[Walter Mondale]] had lost all four, and since then, all three states have remained in the Democratic column for each subsequent presidential election. He swept [[Iowa]], winning by 10 points, an impressive feat in a state that had voted Republican in the last five presidential elections. He won 43% of the vote in [[Kansas]], a surprising showing in the home state of 1936 Republican presidential nominee [[Alf Landon]], Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, and future Republican nominee [[Bob Dole]]. In another surprising showing, he received 47% of the vote in [[South Dakota]]; in [[Montana]], Dukakis won 46% of the vote in a state that had voted over 60% Republican four years earlier. Dukakis's relative strength in farm states was no doubt due to the serious economic difficulties these states were facing in the 1980s, and it was the strongest showing in the Midwest for a Democrat since 1976.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[File:ElectoralCollege1988.svg|thumb|left|The 1988 election with electoral votes by state.]]
Although Dukakis cut into the Republican hold in the Midwest, he failed to dent the emerging GOP stronghold in the South that had been forming since the end of World War II with a temporary reprieve with [[Jimmy Carter]] (along with future President and Southern Democrat Bill Clinton, albeit to a much lesser extent). He lost most of the South by a wide margin, with Bush's totals reaching around 60% in most states. He was able to hold Bush to 55% in Texas, though this was most likely due to Texan [[Lloyd Bentsen]]'s presence on the ticket. He also carried most of the southern-central parishes of [[Louisiana]], despite losing the state. He held onto the border state of [[West Virginia]], and he captured 48% of the vote in [[Missouri]]. He also carried 41% in [[Oklahoma]], a bigger share than any Democrat since Jimmy Carter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Dukakis won 41,809,476 votes in the popular vote. He also received 40% or more in the following states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont. Overall, the 1988 election showed a marked improvement in the popular vote for the Democrats. While he lost the popular vote, Dukakis's margin of loss (7.8%) was narrower than Jimmy Carter's in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] (9.7%) or Walter Mondale's in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] (18.2%).

In 2008, he reflected on his defeat during an interview with [[Katie Couric]], in which he said he "owe[d] the American people an apology" because "if I [[United States presidential election, 1988|had beaten]] the [[George H. W. Bush|old man]], we never would have heard of [[George W. Bush|the kid]], and we wouldn't be in this mess."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4386669n | publisher=CBS News | title=Dukakis Defends Obama Campaign}}</ref>

==Post–presidential election==
In early January 1989, Dukakis announced that he would not run for a fourth term. His final two years as governor were marked by increased criticism of his policies and significant tax increases to cover the economic effects of the U.S. economy's "soft landing" at the end of the 1980s and the recession of 1990.

After the end of his term, he served on the [[board of directors]] for [[Amtrak]], and became a professor of [[political science]] at [[Northeastern University]], a visiting professor of political science at [[Loyola Marymount University]], and visiting professor in the Department of Public Policy at the School of Public Affairs at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Along with a number of other notable [[Greek Americans]], he is a founding member of [[The Next Generation Initiative]]: a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs. In November 2008, Northeastern named its new Center for Urban and Regional Policy after Michael Dukakis and his wife Kitty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Dukakis has developed a strong passion for [[grassroots]] campaigning and the appointment of precinct captains to coordinate local campaigning activities, two strategies he feels are essential for the Democratic Party to compete effectively in both local and national elections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 2006, he and his wife worked to help Democratic candidate [[Deval Patrick]] in his successful effort to become governor of Massachusetts. He did the same in 2012 for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate [[Elizabeth Warren]]. He has also been an advocate for effective public transportation and high-speed rail as a solution to automobile congestion and the lack of space at airports; and for extended learning time initiative in public schools.<ref>"[http://www.ocregister.com/articles/school-day-expanded-2015970-children-massachusetts Make the school day a full day]", ''[[The Orange County Register]]'', April 11, 2008.</ref><ref>"[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/21/who_should_fill_kennedys_seat/]"</ref>

In August 2009, the 75-year-old Dukakis was mentioned as one of two leading candidates as a possible interim successor to [[Ted Kennedy]] in the U.S. Senate, after Kennedy's death.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/21/who_should_fill_kennedys_seat/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Who should fill Kennedy's seat? | first=Scot | last=Lehigh | date=August 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8269945.stm | publisher=BBC News Online | title=Kennedy successor to be appointed | date=September 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> Instead, Gov. Patrick named [[Paul G.

Dukakis stated on January 31, 2014, that he was not in favor of an effort to rename [[South Station]] as the "Gov. Michael S. Dukakis Transportation Center".  He went on to state that he would not object to the naming the as-yet unbuilt [[North-South Rail Link]] after him.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2014/01/michael_dukakis_decries_terminal_honor | work=Boston Herald | title=Michael Dukakis decries terminal honor? | first=Laurel | last=Sweet | date=January 31, 2014}}</ref>

==Family==
Dukakis is married to [[Kitty Dukakis|Katharine D. (Kitty) Dukakis]]. They have three children: John, Andrea, and Kara. During the second presidential debate on October 13, 1988, in Los Angeles, Dukakis revealed that he and his wife had had another child, who died about 20 minutes after birth. Dukakis is the cousin of actress [[Olympia Dukakis]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241144/bio IMDb] — Biography for Michael Dukakis. Retrieved October 18, 2009.</ref>

The Dukakises continue to reside in the home that they bought in the early 1970s in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], where they both grew up, but live in [[Los Angeles]] during the winter while he teaches at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17959 |title=George Bush: Appointment of Katharine D.
