'''Candice Patricia Bergen''' (born May 9, 1946) is an American actress and former [[fashion model]].

She is also an [[Academy Award]] nominee.

Bergen began her career as a fashion model and appeared on the front cover of [[Vogue magazine]], before making her screen debut in the 1966 film ''[[The Group (film)|The Group]]''. She went on to star in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' (1966) and ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971). For her role in the 1979 film ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]'', she received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], while for her role in the 1982 film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', she received a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]]. She made her [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] debut in the 1984 play ''[[Hurlyburly (play)|Hurlyburly]]''.

After her ten seasons on ''Murphy Brown'' (1988-1998), she appeared in three episodes of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' (2000-2002) and earned two Emmy Award nominations for her role as [[Shirley Schmidt]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[legal drama|legal]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Boston Legal]]'' (2005-2008).

She has also returned to Broadway in the 2012 revival of [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[The Best Man (play)|The Best Man]]'' and the 2014 revival of ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.

==Early life==
Bergen was born in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Her mother, [[Frances Bergen]] ([[married and maiden names|née]] Westerman), was a [[John Robert Powers|Powers model]] who was known professionally as Frances Westcott.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/22/Candice-Bergen.html Candice Bergen Biography (1946–)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her father, [[Edgar Bergen]], was a famous [[ventriloquist]], comedian, and actor. Her paternal grandparents were [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born immigrants who [[anglicized]] their surname, which was originally Berggren. As a child, Candice was irritated at being described as "Charlie McCarthy's little sister" (referring to her father's star [[ventriloquism|dummy]]).<ref>"So when I was born, it was only natural that I was known in the press not as Candice Bergen, but as "Charlie's sister."" (Bergen, "My Dad, Charlie and Me' in Jack Canfield, ''et al.'', ''A Second Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul'' 1998:36</ref>

Bergen began appearing on her father's radio program at a young age,<ref>"Bergen & McCarthy 55-12-25 Christmas (Guest Candice Bergen)", listed on Golden Age OTR's playlist on Live365.com</ref> and in 1958, at age eleven, with her father on [[Groucho Marx]]'s quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' as Candy Bergen. She said that when she grew up, she wanted to design clothes. She later attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where she was elected both Homecoming Queen and Miss University, but she later acknowledged that she failed to take her education seriously while at the University. After failing courses in art and opera, she was eventually asked to leave at the end of her sophomore year. She ultimately received an honorary doctorate from Penn in May 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920614&slug=1497120|title=Entertainment & the Arts - Bergen Is Wimpy Compared To Alter-Ego Murphy - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}</ref>

She worked as a fashion model before she took up acting, featured on the covers of [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] magazine.

==Career==

===Early years===
In 1966, Bergen made her screen debut playing a university student in ''[[The Group (film)|The Group]]'', which delicately touched on the then-forbidden subject of lesbianism. The same year, she played the role of Shirley Eckert, an assistant school teacher in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' (1966) opposite [[Steve McQueen]]. The movie was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]]. She was featured in a 1970 political satire, ''[[The Adventurers (1970 film)|The Adventurers]]'', playing a frustrated socialite. In 1975 she starred with [[Sean Connery]] in ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', as a headstrong American widow kidnapped in the Moroccan desert.
[[File:Candice Bergen at 1988 Academy Awards.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Bergen at the [[60th Academy Awards]] in April 1988.]]

She appeared in [[Mike Nichols]]' provocative ''[[Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971) and the [[Burt Reynolds]] romantic comedy ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]'' (1979), for which she received [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations for best supporting actress.

Bergen had roles in Western films including ''[[The Hunting Party (1971 film)|The Hunting Party]]'' and ''[[Bite the Bullet (film)|Bite the Bullet]]'', both of which starred [[Gene Hackman]]. Another Western she starred in was the highly controversial ''[[Soldier Blue]]'', a worldwide hit, but a failure in its homeland. It led to Bergen's being voted by British exhibitors as the seventh most popular star at the British box office in 1971.<ref>Peter Waymark. "Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas." Times [London, England] 30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.</ref>

She was the love interest of [[Ryan O'Neal]] in the ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' sequel, ''[[Oliver's Story]]'', and portrayed a best-selling author in ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]'' (1981) with [[Jacqueline Bisset]]. In 1982, Bergen appeared in the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Oscar-winning]] film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' in which she portrayed documentary photographer [[Margaret Bourke-White]]. Bergen was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?year=1982&category=Film&award=Supporting+Actress|title= BAFTA Awards Database (Supporting Actress 1982)|author= BAFTA|year= 1983|work= British Academy of Film and Television Arts|publisher= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

Turning to television, Bergen appeared in the 1985 miniseries ''[[Hollywood Wives (miniseries)|Hollywood Wives]]''. In addition to acting, Bergen has written articles, a play, and a memoir, ''Knock Wood'' (1984). She has also studied photography and worked as a photojournalist.

===''Murphy Brown''===
In 1988, she took the lead role in the sitcom ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', in which she played a tough television reporter. The series provided her with the opportunity to show her little-seen comic talent, and although primarily a conventional sit-com, the show did tackle important issues. Murphy Brown, a recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], became a single mother and later battled [[breast cancer]]. In 1992, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dan Quayle]] criticized prime-time TV for showing the Murphy Brown character "mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/08/08/cnn25.tan.quayle/index.html | title = Then & Now: Dan Quayle | date = 2005-08-08 | publisher = CNN}}</ref>

Quayle's remarks became comedic fodder and were written into the show, with Murphy shown watching Quayle's speech. A subsequent episode explored the subject of family values within a diverse set of families. The Brown character arranges for a truckload of [[potato]]es to be dumped in front of Quayle's residence, an allusion to an infamous incident in which Quayle erroneously directed a school child to spell the word "potato" as "potatoe". In reality, Bergen agreed with at least some of Quayle's observations, saying that while the particular remark was "an arrogant and uninformed posture", as a whole, it was "a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/07/11/showbuzz/index.html | title = Candice Bergen agrees with Quayle | publisher = CNN | date = 2002-07-11}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Bergen's run on ''Murphy Brown'' was extremely successful. The show ran for ten seasons and between 1989 and 1998, Bergen was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] seven times and won five. After her fifth win, she declined future nominations for the role.

Throughout the same time frame as ''Murphy Brown'', Bergen also appeared as the main spokesperson for a [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] telephone ad campaign.

===Later career===
After playing the role of Murphy Brown, Bergen was offered a chance to work as a real-life journalist. After the run of ''Murphy Brown'' ended in 1998, CBS approached her to cover stories for ''[[60 Minutes]]'', an offer she declined, with the conviction that she didn't personally want to blur the lines between actor and journalist at the time.

After ''Murphy Brown'', Bergen hosted ''Exhale with Candice Bergen'' on the [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen network]]. She also appeared in character roles in films, including ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'', where she played villainous pageant host Kathy Morningside; she also portrayed the mayor of New York in ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (movie)|Sweet Home Alabama]]''. In 2003, she appeared in the [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] flight-attendant comedy, ''[[View from the Top]]''.

In January 2005, Bergen joined the cast of the television series ''[[Boston Legal]]'' as Shirley Schmidt, a founding partner in the law firm of [[Crane, Poole & Schmidt]]. She played the role for five seasons. In 2006 and 2008, she received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

A frequent host on NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', she was the first woman to host the show and the first host to do a second show.  She was also the first woman to join the [[Five-Timers Club]], when she hosted for the fifth time in 1990. Bergen guest-starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in its first year, appearing in several skits, an episode now available in a DVD collection. She was also featured in a long-running "Dime Lady" ad campaign for the [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] phone company.

She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (as herself playing Murphy Brown), ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Will & Grace]]'' (playing herself), and ''[[Sex and the City]]'', where she played Enid Frick, [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s editor at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. More recently she appeared in the 2009 movie ''[[Bride Wars]]'' as Marion St. Claire, New York's most sought-after wedding planner, who also serves as the narrator of the story.

Since its launch in 2008, Candice Bergen has been a contributor for [[wowOwow]].com, a website for women to talk culture, politics and gossip.

Bergen had an occasional role on ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' as [[Lisa Cuddy]]'s mother, starting in Season 7, including the 2011 episodes "[[Larger Than Life (House)|Larger Than Life]]" and "[[Family Practice (House)|Family Practice]]".

In 2010, she appeared in a one-night only concert semi staged reading of ''[[Evening Primrose (musical)|Evening Primrose]]'' by [[Stephen Sondheim]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Portantiere |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |year=2011 |title=Back into the light |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVII |issue=3 |pages=44|publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> She has also appeared on Broadway in the 2012 revival of [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[The Best Man (play)|The Best Man]]'' and the 2014 revival of ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Candice Bergen.jpg|thumb|Candice Bergen and her mother [[Frances Bergen]] at the 62nd Academy Awards March 26, 1990]]
A political activist, Bergen accepted a date with [[Henry Kissinger]]. During her activist days she participated in a [[Youth International Party|Yippie]] prank when she, [[Abbie Hoffman]], and others threw dollar bills onto the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1967, leading to its temporary shutdown.  In 1972, she [[Celebrity activists in George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign|served as a fundraiser and organizer]] for [[George McGovern]]'s [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|presidential campaign]].<ref>McGovern, George S., ''Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern'', New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 173, 247</ref>

Bergen and former boyfriend [[Terry Melcher]] lived at [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Los Angeles]], which was later occupied by [[Sharon Tate]] and her husband, [[Roman Polanski]]. Tate and four others were murdered in the home in 1969 by followers of [[Charles Manson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1477227/Terry-Melcher.html|title=Obituary Terry Melcher|date=2004-11-23|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> There was some initial speculation that Melcher may have been the intended victim,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rLgyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EHEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,3106227&dq=candice+bergen+terry+melcher&hl=en|title=Doris Day's son, musician, writer, record producer|date=2004-11-23|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|pages=A–15|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> although Melcher, his former roommate [[Mark Lindsay]], and [[Vincent Bugliosi]] have all indicated Manson was aware that Melcher was no longer living at that address at the time of the murders.<ref>{{cite news|journal=Midland Reporter-Telegram|title=Mark Lindsay talks about new music, cats and Charlie Manson|url=http://www.mywesttexas.com/top_stories/article_471dbd11-a57f-5840-960b-ec33249c4f41.html|author=Nancy Adamson|date=June 8, 2013 <!-- 7:15 pm --> }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=McKay |date=January 1983|title=Two Faces of Cincinnati|journal= Cincinnati Magazine|page= 94|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vx0DAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA94&ots=YWjyN0ztc_&dq=terry%20and%20the%20pirates%20doris%20day&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=terry%20and%20the%20pirates%20doris%20day&f=false |accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref>

On September 27, 1980, she married French film director [[Louis Malle]]. They had one child, a daughter named Chloe, in 1985. The couple were married until Malle's death from [[cancer]] on Thanksgiving Day in 1995.

Bergen has traveled extensively and speaks French fluently. She is now married to New York real estate magnate and [[philanthropist]] Marshall Rose.<!-- please do not link to the wikipedia entry for Marshall T. Rose, the network protocol and software engineer -->
