===Emmy Awards and controversy===
Burstyn was nominated for an Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Actress in a Miniseries or Movie]], for her role as [[Jean Harris]] in the biographical [[Television movie|television film]] ''[[The People vs. Jean Harris]]'' (1981) and again for another television drama film, ''Pack of Lies'' (1987), an adaptation of the [[Pack of Lies|1983 play]].

In 2006, she was nominated for an Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie]] for a role credited as "Former Tarnower Steady" in HBO's biographical television film ''[[Mrs. Harris (film)|Mrs. Harris]]''. (She had played [[Jean Harris]] in ''The People vs. Jean Harris'').<ref name=emmys>{{cite web| title=Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Miniseries Or A Movie - 2006| url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2006/supporting-actress-movie-miniseries| publisher=emmys.com| accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

Soon after the nominations were announced, an outcry ensued from the press and the public regarding the worthiness of the nomination due to her minor role in the film, consisting of 14 seconds of screen time and 38 words of dialogue. One explanation for the nomination was that people were honoring Burstyn for her nominated but non-winning performance in the first ''Harris'' television film. A more popular accusation was that the nominating committee was either confused in its recollection, or merely "threw in" her name from sheer recognition, assuming a worthy performance without actually seeing it.<ref name=bianco>{{cite news| first=Robert| last=Bianco| title=Emmys need a fast fix| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/televisionawards/emmys/2006-08-24-emmy-main_x.htm| publisher=USAtoday.com| work=[[USA Today]]| date=August 27, 2006| accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]], administrator of the Primetime Emmy Awards, initially insisted that "based on the popular vote, this is a legitimate nomination." Meanwhile, HBO deflected the blame for submitting the nomination to the movie-production company. Burstyn's own reaction ranged from initial silence to comments such as, "I thought it was fabulous. My next ambition is to get nominated for seven seconds, and ultimately I want to be nominated for a picture in which I don't even appear," and "This doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't even want to know about this. You people work it out yourself."<ref name=emmynod>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-11-03-burstyn_x.htm| title=Ellen Burstyn Sounds Off on Her Emmy Nod| agency=[[Associated Press]]| work=USA Today| date=November 3, 2006| publisher=USAtoday.com| accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

Ultimately, [[Kelly Macdonald]], who starred in ''[[The Girl in the Cafe]]'', won the award.<ref name=scots>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/5292128.stm| title=Scots star wins Emmy for TV role| work=BBC News| publisher=bbc.com| accessdate=April 13, 2013| date=August 28, 2006}}</ref>
In March 2007, the Academy officially announced that eligibility for a Primetime Emmy Award in any long-form supporting-actor category required nominees to appear on-screen in at least five percent of the project.<ref name="post">{{cite web| author=[[Lisa de Moraes]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031602142.html| title=Emmy Rules Change After Burstyn Nomination Flap| work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=March 17, 2007| publisher=washingtonpost.com| accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

Many critics still cite this incident to criticize the Emmy Award nomination process, claiming that name recognition has played an increasingly visible role over the years.<ref name="post"/>

In 2013, she won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for ''[[Political Animals (miniseries)|Political Animals]]'', and referenced the controversy in her acceptance speech.

In her autobiography, ''Lessons in Becoming Myself'', Burstyn revealed that he [[stalking|stalked]] her for a period of six years after their divorce.

===Religion===
Burstyn was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] but now affiliates herself to all religious faiths. Her spiritual journey began with Sufi Islam. She explains: "I am a spirit opening to the truth that lives in all of these religions... I always pray to Spirit, but sometimes it's to the Goddess. Sometimes it's to [[Jesus]]... Sometimes I pray to [[Ganesha]] if I need an obstacle removed. [[Quan Yin]] is one of my favorite manifestations of the divine, the embodiment of compassion... So I have Quan Yin with me all the time."<ref name=reiss>{{cite web| title=Ellen Burstyn's True Face| url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Celebrities/Ellen-Burstyns-True-Face.aspx?p=1#| publisher=[[Beliefnet]]| year=2006| accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> Burstyn has stated that in her late 30s she began to delve into the spiritual realm, coming under the tutelage of Sufi Muslim teacher Pir [[Vilayat Inayat Khan]]; he gave her the spiritual name Hadiya, which means "she who guides" in Arabic.
