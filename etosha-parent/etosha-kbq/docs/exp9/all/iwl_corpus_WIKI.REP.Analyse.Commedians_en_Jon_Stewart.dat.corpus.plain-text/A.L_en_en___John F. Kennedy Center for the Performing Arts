The '''John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts''' (on the building itself called the '''John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts''', and commonly referred to as the '''Kennedy Center''') is a [[performing arts center]] located on the [[Potomac River]], adjacent to the [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The Center, which opened September 8, 1971, produces and presents [[theater]], [[dance]], [[ballet]], orchestral, chamber, [[jazz]], popular, and [[folk music]], in addition to multi-media performances for all ages.

It is the busiest performing arts facility in the United States and annually hosts approximately 2,000 performances for audiences totaling nearly two million; Center-related touring productions, television, and radio broadcasts welcome 20 million more. Now in its 44th season, the Center presents the greatest examples of music, dance and theater; supports artists in the creation of new work; and serves the nation as a leader in arts education. With its artistic affiliate, the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the Center's achievements as a commissioner, producer, and nurturer of developing artists have resulted in over 200 theatrical productions, dozens of new ballets, operas, and musical works.

Tracing its beginning to the ''National Cultural Center Act'' of Congress in 1958, which requires that its programming be sustained through private funds, the center represents a [[public-private partnership]]. It is both the nation's public [[Presidential memorials in the United States|memorial]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and the "national center for the [[performing arts]]." Its activities include educational and outreach initiatives, almost entirely funded through ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations.

Designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]], it was built by Philadelphia contractor [[John McShain]] and is administered by a bureau of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. It receives federal funding each year to pay for the maintenance and operation of the building.

==History==
The idea for the center dates to 1933 when [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] discussed ideas for the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|Emergency Relief and Civil Works Administration]] to create employment for [[unemployment|unemployed]] actors during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="meersman-p527">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |pages=527–528}}</ref> In 1935, [[United States Congress|Congress]] held [[congressional hearing|hearings]] on plans to establish a new Department of Science, Art and Literature and to build a monumental theater and arts building on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] near the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] building.

The [[Library of Congress]] added a small auditorium, but it had restrictions on its use. A congressional resolution in 1938 called for construction of a "public building which shall be known as the '''National Cultural Center'''" near [[Judiciary Square]], but nothing materialized.<ref name="meersman-p527"/>

[[File:Hall of States.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Flags in the Hall of States]]

In 1950, the idea for a national theater resurfaced when [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Arthur George Klein]] of New York introduced a bill to authorize funds to plan and build a cultural center. The bill included provisions that the center would prohibit any discrimination of cast or audience. In 1955, the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the center.<ref>{{cite web| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061129224242/|archivedate=2006-11-29| url=http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/timeline1.html| title=Timeline of SRI International Innovations: 1940s - 1950s| publisher=[[SRI International]]| accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> From 1955 to 1958, Congress debated the idea amid much controversy. In the summer of 1958, a bill was finally passed in Congress and September 4, 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed into law the National Cultural Center Act which provided momentum for the project.<ref name="meersman-p529">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=529}}</ref>

This was the first time in history that the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] helped finance a structure dedicated to the performing arts. The legislation required a portion of the costs, estimated at $10–25 million, to be raised within five years of the bill's passage.<ref name="meersman-p541">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=541}}</ref> Edward Durell Stone was selected as architect for the project in June 1959.<ref name="meersman-p542">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=542}}</ref> He presented preliminary designs to the President's Music Committee in October 1959, along with estimated costs of $50 million, double the original estimates of $25–30 million. By November 1959, estimated costs had escalated to $61 million.<ref name="meersman-p543">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=543}}</ref> Despite this, Stone's design was well received in editorials in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Washington Star]]'', and quickly approved by the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], [[National Capital Planning Commission]], and the [[National Park Service]].<ref name="meersman-p544">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=544}}</ref>

The National Cultural Center was renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1964, following the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]].<ref name="nyt-robertson">{{cite news |title=At Last, the Performances Begin |work=The New York Times |last=Robertson |first=Nan |date=September 6, 1971 |authorlink=Nan C.

===Fundraising===
The National Cultural Center Board of Trustees, a group Eisenhower established January 29, 1959, led fundraising.<ref name="meersman-p541"/> Fundraising efforts were not successful, with only $13,425 raised in the first three years.<ref name="meersman-p545">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=545}}</ref> President John F.

The plaza entrance of the Kennedy Center features two [[Wikt:tableau|tableaus]] by German sculptor [[:de:Jürgen Weber (Bildhauer)|Jürgen Weber]]; created between 1965 and 1971, which were a gift to the Kennedy Center from the [[West German]] government. Near the north end of the plaza is a display of nude figures in scenes representing [[war and peace]], called ''War or Peace''. The piece, {{convert|8|x|50|x|1.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, depicts five scenes showing the symbolism of war and peace: a war scene, murder, family, and creativity.<ref name="SOS">{{cite web| year=1994| title=War or Peace, (sculpture)| work=Save Outdoor Sculpture, District of Columbia survey| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!322453~!0#focus| accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref> At the south end is ''America'' which represents Weber's image of America (8 x 50 x 1.5&nbsp;ft.).

==Venues==
[[File:Kennedy center diagram.svg|thumb|right|375px|Layout of the three main theaters at the Kennedy Center]]

The Kennedy Center has three main theaters: the Concert Hall, the Opera House, and the Eisenhower Theater.

===Concert Hall===
The Concert Hall, located at the south end of the Center, seats 2,442 including chorister seats and stage boxes, and has a seating arrangement similar to that used in many European halls such as [[Musikverein]] in Vienna. The Concert Hall is the largest performance space in the Kennedy Center and is the home of the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]]. A 1997 renovation brought a high-tech acoustical canopy, handicap-[[accessibility|accessible]] locations on every level, and new seating sections (onstage boxes, chorister seats, and parterre seats). The [[Hadeland Glassverk|Hadeland]] crystal chandeliers, given by the government of Norway, were repositioned to provide a clearer view.<ref name="nyt-gifts" /> Canadian organbuilder [[Casavant Frères]] constructed and installed a new pipe organ in 2012.<ref name=Wakin>{{cite web| last=Wakin| first=Daniel J.| work=The New York Times| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/kennedy-center-to-replace-its-pipe-organ/| title=Kennedy Center to Replace Its Pipe Organ| date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Opera House===
The Opera House, in the middle, has about 2,300 seats. Its interior features include walls covered in red velvet, a distinctive red and gold silk curtain, given by the Japanese government, and [[J. & L. Lobmeyr|Lobmeyr]] crystal chandelier with matching pendants, which were a gift from the government of [[Austria]].<ref name="nyt-gifts" /> It is the major opera, ballet, and large-scale musical venue of the Center, and closed during the 2003/2004 season for extensive renovations which provided a revised seating arrangement and redesigned entrances at the orchestra level. It is the home of the [[Washington National Opera]] and the annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]].

===Eisenhower Theater===
The Eisenhower Theater, on the north side, seats about 1,163 and is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed the National Cultural Center Act into law on September 2, 1958. It primarily hosts plays and musicals, smaller-scale operas, ballet and contemporary dance. The theater contains an orchestra pit for up to 35 musicians that is convertible to a forestage or additional seating space. The venue reopened in October 2008, following a 16-month renovation which altered the color scheme and seating arrangements.

===Other performance venues===
[[File:Theater Lab, Kennedy Center.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Theater Lab]]
Other performance venues in the Center include:
*'''The Family Theater''', with 324 seats, opened December 9, 2005. It replaced the former [[American Film Institute]] Theater located adjacent to the Hall of States. The new Family Theater provides a home for world-class family theater performances for the nation's youth and continues the Kennedy Center's $125 million commitment to performing arts education for adults and children alike. Designed by the architectural firm Richter Cornbrooks Gribble, Inc. of Baltimore, the new theater incorporates the most modern theatrical innovations available, including: premium audio technologies; a computerized rigging system; and a digital video projection system.
*'''The Terrace Theater''', with 513 seats, was constructed on the roof terrace level in the late 1970s as a Bicentennial gift from the people of Japan to the United States. It is used for intimate performances of chamber music, ballet and contemporary dance, and theater.
*'''The Theater Lab''', with 399 seats, currently houses the whodunit ''[[Shear Madness]]'' which has been playing continuously since August 1987.
*'''The Millennium Stage'''. Part of the concept of "Performing Arts for Everyone" launched by then-Chairman James Johnson in the winter of 1997, the Millennium Stage provides free performances every evening at 6:00 pm on two specially created stages at either end of the Grand Foyer. A broad range of art forms are featured on the Millennium Stage. These include performing artists and groups from all 50 states and an Artist-in-Residence program featuring artists performing several evenings in a month. Every show on the Millennium Stage is available as a simulcast of the live show at 6:00 pm, and is archived for later viewing via the Kennedy Center's website. "Performing Arts for Everyone" was designed to introduce the Kennedy Center and its programs to a far wider audience than ever before by providing a performance open to the public and free of charge 365 days a year. In addition, "Performing Arts for Everyone" initiatives include low- and no-cost tickets available to performances on every stage of the Kennedy Center, and several outreach programs designed to increase access to the Center's tickets and performances.
*'''The KC Jazz Club'''. March 12, 2003, the space formerly known as the Education Resource Center was officially designated the Terrace Gallery. It is now home to the Kennedy Center [[Jazz]] Club.

===River and rooftop terraces===
The Kennedy Center offers one of the only open air rooftop terraces in downtown Washington, DC free of charge to the public, open from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. until midnight each day, except when closed for private events. The wide terrace provides views in all four directions overlooking the [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn]] skyline in [[Arlington, Virginia]] to the West; the Potomac River and National Airport to the South; the Washington Harbor and the Watergate Complex to the North; and the [[Lincoln Memorial]], [[Department of State]] buildings, [[George Washington University]] and the [[Saudi]] Embassy to the East.

==Productions==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

===Dance===
World premiere performances of Kennedy Center-commissioned works have been offered through a commissioning program for new ballet and dance works. These works have been created by America's foremost choreographers—Paul Taylor, [[Lar Lubovitch]], and Merce Cunningham—for leading American dance companies including American Ballet Theatre, Ballet West, Houston Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, and the San Francisco Ballet. Since 1999, the Kennedy Center has supported and produced the Suzanne Farrell Ballet in performances at the Center and on extended tours.

The Center sponsors two annual dance residency programs for young people; Exploring Ballet with Suzanne Farrell and the Dance Theatre of Harlem Residency Program, both now in their second decade. The Kennedy Center's Contemporary Dance series offers a wide range of artistic perspectives, from the foremost masters of the genre to the art form's newest and most exciting artists. In the 2008/2009 series, the Kennedy Center recognized Modern Masters of American Dance, bringing [[Martha Graham Dance Company]], [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]], [[José Limón|Limón Dance Company]], [[Mark Morris Dance Group]], [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]], [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]] and [[Paul Taylor Dance Company]].

===Education===
In recent years the Kennedy Center has dramatically expanded its education programs to reach young people, teachers, and families throughout the nation. The 2005 opening of the Family Theater has helped achieve this.

For over 35 years, the Kennedy Center Education Department has provided arts experiences through performances, residencies, workshops, conferences, career development programs, symposia, and on-line and print resources. In the past year, the Center's education programs have directly impacted more than 11 million people across the nation. The Education Department fosters understandings and participation in the performing arts through programs and performances for diverse populations of all ages.

====Performances for Young Audiences====
;Theater for Young Audiences (TYA)

Started in 1969 by Roger L. Stevens, the Kennedy Center's founding chairman, the [[Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival]] (KCACTF) is a national theater program involving 18,000 students from colleges and universities nationwide which has served as a catalyst in improving the quality of college theater in the United States. The KCACTF has grown into a network of more than 600 academic institutions throughout the country, where theater departments and student artists showcase their work and receive outside assessment by KCACTF respondents. Since its establishment in 1969, KCACTF has reached more than 17.5 million theatergoing students and teachers nationwide.

====Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)====
The Kennedy Center's CETA program's mission is make the arts a critical component in every child's education. CETA, which stands for Changing Education Through the Arts, creates professional development opportunities for teachers and school administrators. Each year over 700 teachers participate in approximately 60 courses that focus on ways to integrate the arts into their teaching.<ref>{{cite web| title=Ceta: Program Overview| url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/ceta/overview.html| accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> The Kennedy Center's CETA program also partners with sixteen schools in the Washington DC Metro area to develop long-range plan for arts integration at their school. Two of these schools, [http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/parkwoodes/ Kensington Parkwood Elementary School] in Kensington, MD and [http://www.fcps.edu/WoodburnES/woodburn_arts_integration.html Woodburn Elementary School for the Fine and Communicative Arts] in Falls Church, Virginia serve as Research and Development schools for CETA.

===Festivals===
The Kennedy Center presents festivals celebrating cities, countries, and regions of the world. The festivals are filled with a wide range of performing arts, visual arts, cuisine, and multi-media. In 2008, the Center presented an exploration of the culture of Japan entitled ''Japan! culture + hyperculture''. The 2009 Arab festival was an unprecedented exploration of the culture of the 22 Arab countries in the League of Arab States, titled ''Arabesque: Arts of the Arab World''. In 2011, the Kennedy Center presented ''maximum INDIA'', a three-week-long celebration of the arts and culture of the sub-continent.

===Jazz===
Since its establishment in September 1971, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has showcased world-class jazz in solo, various ensembles, and big band settings. In 1994, the Kennedy Center appointed Dr. [[Billy Taylor]] as Artistic Advisor for Jazz, and his first installation was his own radio show ''Billy Taylor's Jazz at the Kennedy Center''. Featuring his trio and guest artists in performance and discussion, the series ran for seven seasons on [[NPR]]. Since Taylor's appointment in 1994, the Center has initiated numerous performance programs to promote jazz on a national stage, featuring leading international artists and rising stars, including: the [[Art Tatum]] Piano Panorama, named after Dr. Taylor's mentor; the [[Louis Armstrong]] Legacy, highlighting vocalists; the [[Mary Lou Williams]] Women in Jazz Festival, the first festival by a major institution promoting outstanding female jazz artists; Beyond Category, featuring artists whose work transcends genre; the Platinum Series, with internationally acclaimed headliners; Jazz Ambassadors with the [[United States Department of State]], sending musicians on worldwide goodwill tours (1998–2004); the KC Jazz Club, a highly praised intimate setting; and Discovery Artists in the KC Jazz Club, highlighting up-and-coming talent. Kennedy Center and NPR annually collaborate on the beloved holiday broadcast NPR's Piano Jazz Christmas. Since 2003, the Center's jazz programs have been regularly broadcast on NPR's ''JazzSet'' with [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]]. Recent highlights, produced by the Center, have included ''Great Vibes, A Salute to [[Lionel Hampton]]'' (1995); ''Billy Taylor's 80th Birthday Celebration'' (2002); ''[[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], A Career Celebration'' (2003); ''[[Michel Legrand]] with [[Patti Austin]]'', part of the Center's Festival of France (2004); ''A Tribute to [[Shirley Horn]]'' (2004); ''[[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]'s 80th Birthday'' (2005); and ''[[Benny Golson]] at 80'' (2009). In March 2007, the Center hosted a once-in-a-lifetime celebration, Jazz in Our Time, which bestowed the Center's Living Jazz Legend Award to over 30 revered artists. During Dr. Taylor's tenure, the Center has created recognized educational initiatives, including national jazz satellite distance-learning programs; adult lecture series; master classes and workshops with national artists and local metropolitan Washington, D.C. students; and [[Betty Carter]]'s Jazz Ahead—continuing the singer's legacy of identifying outstanding young talent.

===National Symphony Orchestra (NSO)===
The National Symphony Orchestra, the Kennedy Center's artistic affiliate since 1987, has commissioned dozens of new works, among them [[Stephen Albert]]'s ''RiverRun'', which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music; [[Morton Gould]]'s ''[[Stringmusic]]'', also a Pulitzer Prize-winner; William Bolcolm's Sixth Symphony, and [[Michael Daugherty]]'s ''UFO'', a concerto for solo percussion and orchestra.

In addition to its regular season concerts, the National Symphony Orchestra presents a host of outreach, education, and pops programs, as well as concerts at [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts|Wolf Trap]] each year. The annual American Residencies for the Kennedy Center is a program unique to the National Symphony Orchestra and the Center. The Center sends the Orchestra to a different state each year for an intensive period of performances and teaching encompassing full orchestral, chamber, and solo concerts, master classes and other teaching sessions. The Orchestra has given these residencies in 20 states so far: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Nevada, and Wyoming/Montana.

The NSO recording of [[John Corigliano]]'s ''Of Rage and Remembrance'' won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1996.

===Performing Arts for Everyone (PAFE)===
The Kennedy Center is the only U.S. institution that presents a free performance 365 days a year. The Millennium Stage, created as part of the Center's Performing Arts for Everyone initiative in 1997 and underwritten by James A. Johnson and Maxine Isaacs, features a broad spectrum of performing arts, from dance and jazz, to chamber music and folk, comedy, storytelling and theater. In the past twelve years, over three million people have attended Millennium Stage performances. The Millennium Stage has presented more than 42,000 artists, which includes over 4,000 international artists from more than 70 countries; performers representing all 50 states; and 20,000 Washington-area ensembles and solo artists. The Charlie Byrd Trio and the Billy Taylor Trio were the first artists to delight audiences with a free performance on March 1, 1997. In 1999, the Center began web-casting each night's live performance, and continues to archive and maintain each event in a database of over 3,000 performances which may be accessed via the Center's website. Performing Arts for Everyone initiatives also include low- and no-cost tickets available to performances on every stage of the Kennedy Center, and several outreach programs designed to increase access to Kennedy Center tickets and performances.

===Theater===
The Center has co-produced more than 300 new works of theater over the past 43 years, including Tony-winning shows ranging from ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' in 1977 to ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[Titanic (musical)|Titanic]]'', and the American premiere of ''[[Les Misérables]]''.

==Renovations==
On June 16, 1971, Congress authorized appropriations for one year to the Board of Trustees for operating and maintenance expenses. In following years, the appropriations were provided to the National Park Service for operations, maintenance, security, safety and other functions not directly related to the performing arts activities.<ref name="gao1993-p2">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d36t11/148480.pdf |format=PDF| author=[[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] |title=Kennedy Center: Information on the Capital Improvement Program |date=February 1993 |page=2}}</ref> The National Park Service and the Kennedy Center signed a cooperative agreement requiring each party to pay a portion of the operating and maintenance costs based on what proportion of time the building was to be used for performing arts functions. The agreement did not specify who was responsible for long-term capital improvement projects at the Kennedy Center, along with only periodic funding by Congress for one-time projects.<ref name="gao1993-p3">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d36t11/148480.pdf |format=PDF |author=General Accounting Office |title=Kennedy Center: Information on the Capital Improvement Program |date=February 1993 |page=3}}</ref>

===Changes 1990-2005===
By 1990, the condition of the Kennedy Center facility had deteriorated severely. So in fiscal years 1991 and 1992, Congress recommended that $27.7 million be allocated for capital improvement projects at the Center, including $12 million for structural repairs to the garage and $15.7 million for structural and mechanical repairs, as well as projects for improving handicapped access.<ref name="gao1993-p4">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d36t11/148480.pdf |format=PDF |author=General Accounting Office |title=Kennedy Center: Information on the Capital Improvement Program |publisher=GAO Report to Congress |date=February 1993 |page=4}}</ref> In 1994, Congress gave full responsibility to the Kennedy Center for capital improvement projects and facility management.<ref name="gao2005-p1">{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05334.pdf |author=Government Accountability Office |title=Stronger Oversight of Fire Safety Issues, Construction Projects, and Financial Management Needed |date=April 2005 |page=1 |format=PDF}}</ref> From 1995 to 2005, over $200 million of federal funds were allocated to the Kennedy Center for long-term capital projects, repairs, and to bring the center into compliance with modern [[fire safety]] and accessibility codes.<ref name="gao2005-p1" /> Improvements included [[renovation]] of the Concert Hall, Opera House, plaza-level public spaces, and a new fire alarm system.<ref name="gao2005-p3">{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05334.pdf |author=Government Accountability Office |title=Stronger Oversight of Fire Safety Issues, Construction Projects, and Financial Management Needed |date=April 2005 |page=3 |format=PDF}}</ref> The renovations projects were completed 13 to 50 percent over budget, due to modifications of plans during the renovations resulting in [[overtime]] and other penalties.<ref name="gao2005-p4">{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05334.pdf |author=Government Accountability Office |title=Stronger Oversight of Fire Safety Issues, Construction Projects, and Financial Management Needed |date=April 2005 |page=4 |format=PDF}}</ref> Renovations to the Eisenhower Theater were completed in 2008.<ref name="smith" />

===Proposed changes in 2013===
In 2013, the center announced plans for $100 million {{convert|65,000|sqft|m2}} addition of three connected pavilions cascading down to the Potomac to house classrooms, multipurpose rooms, rehearsals and a new public entrance to the center. The lowest pavilion is to be on a pier on the river and would be used for outdoor performances. They are to be designed by [[Steven Holl]] with help by architect firm [[BNIM]]. The proposed design is somewhat similar to the Bloch Addition to the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], on which the two architectural firms collaborated in 2007. The plans call for the pavilions to be built with translucent Okalux light diffusing insulated glass and the same Carrara marble used for the Kennedy Center. Landscaping of the pavilions includes pools with the same dimension as the [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]. Plans for the project began after [[David M. Rubenstein]] donated $50 million to the center.<ref name=BNIM>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nojavascript.html |title=KC firm BNIM will help design $100 million expansion of Kennedy Center |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=2014-11-04| subscription=yes}}</ref>

==Management==
Prior to 1980, daily operations of the Kennedy Center were overseen by the chairman of the board of directors, and by the board itself. Aspects of the center's programming and operations were overseen by various other people. George London was the Kennedy Center's first executive director (often called "artistic director" by the press, although that was not the formal title), serving from 1968 to 1970,<ref name=LondonGala>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/17/arts/news-of-music-nov-4-gala-to-honor-george-london.html| last=Davis| first=Peter G.| title=Nov. 4 Gala to Honor George London| work=The New York Times| date=September 17, 1981| accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref> while William McCormick Blair, Jr. was its first administrative director.<ref>{{cite news| last=Robertson| first=Nan| title=Rudel and Blair Accept Kennedy Arts Center Jobs| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9405E1D81031E034BC4953DFB4668383679EDE| work=The New York Times| date=February 1, 1968| accessdate=2014-11-04| subscription=yes}}</ref> Julius Rudel took over as music director in 1971.<ref name=Hectic>{{cite news| last=Taubman| first=Howard| title=Rudel Logs a Hectic Day In Kennedy Center Roles| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE4DF1338EF34BC4850DFBE66838A669EDE| work=The New York Times| date=August 30, 1971| accessdate=2014-11-04| subscription=yes}}</ref> In 1972, Martin Feinstein replaced London and held the position of artistic director until 1980.<ref name=FeinsteinObit>{{cite news| last=Saxon| first=Wolfgang| title=Martin Feinstein, 84, Dies; Led the National Opera| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/07/arts/music/07feinstein.html?mabReward=relbias:r,{"2":"RI:14"}&adxnnl=1&module=Search&adxnnlx=1415136980-FBHAFEbzbWlEw0shjbWdZA| work=The New York Times| date=February 7, 2006| accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref> [[Marta Casals Istomin]] was named the first female artistic director in 1980, a position she held until 1990;<ref name="RutterNamed"/> she was also the first person to be formally invested with that title.<ref name=Monitor>{{cite news| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0229/022900.html| title=Kennedy Center Artistic Director| work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]| date=February 29, 1980| accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref><ref name=Cummings>{{cite news| last1=Cummings| first1=Judith| last2=Krebs| first2=Albin| title=The Kennedy Center Names a New Artistic Director| work=The New York Times| date=February 27, 1980| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E3DC143BE732A25754C2A9649C94619FD6CF| accessdate=2014-11-04| subscription=yes}}</ref>
