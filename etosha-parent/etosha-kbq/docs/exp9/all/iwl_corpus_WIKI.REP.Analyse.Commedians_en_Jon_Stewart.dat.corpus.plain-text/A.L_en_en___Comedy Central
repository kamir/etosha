'''Comedy Central''' is an [[United States|American]] [[cable television|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[cable channel|channel]] that is owned by Viacom Media Networks Entertainment Group, a unit of the [[Viacom Media Networks]] division of [[Viacom]]. The channel carries comedy programming, in the form of both original and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series and [[stand-up comedy]] specials, as well as [[feature film]]s.

==History==

===Creation (1989–1991)===
On November 15, 1989, [[Time Warner]], owners of [[HBO]], launched [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]] as the first cable channel devoted exclusively to comedy-based programming. On April 1, 1990, [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (who owned [[MTV]], [[VH1]], and [[Nickelodeon]]) launched a rival channel called [[Ha! (TV channel)|Ha!]]<ref name="latimes">{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-15/entertainment/ca-1886_1_comedy-channel | title=Cable Comedy--Will HBO Have the Last Laugh? : Television: The 24-hour Comedy Channel premieres tonight, but Viacom has plans to launch its own comedy channel, HA!, in the spring | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref> that featured reruns of [[sitcom|situation comedies]] and some original [[sketch comedy]].

The Comedy Channel's programs were broadcast from the HBO Downtown Studios at 120 East 23rd Street in [[Manhattan]]. The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such as ''Onion World'' with [[Rich Hall]] and ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, including ''The Sweet Life'' with [[Rachel Sweet]], ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', ''[[Sports Monster]]'', and ''[[The Higgins Boys and Gruber]]'', the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series like ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]''.

The standard format for The Comedy Channel's shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without "host segments" were dubbed ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]''. In 1990, hosts under this title, [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Patty Rosborough]], were introduced. Comedian [[Marc Maron]] also hosted the series.

While The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |title=The Origin and Early Programs of Comedy Central |author=Boone, Brian |date=January 12, 2012 |work=Splitsider |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> Ha!'s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister network [[Nick at Nite]]) as well as complete 90-minute reruns of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from the sixth through 16th seasons.

After two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching on [[April Fools' Day|April 1]], 1991 as CTV: The Comedy Network; it later changed its name to Comedy Central on June 1, 1991 to prevent issues with the [[Canada|Canadian]] broadcast television network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].<ref>(Name change to Comedy Central within a month of launch due to a lawsuit with CTV in Canada)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4895/is_199103/ai_n17999383]</ref> Viacom bought out Time Warner's half in April 2003 for $1.23 billion.<ref name="cnn03">{{cite web| title =  Viacom buys Comedy Central | publisher = [[CNN Money]]| date = April 22, 2003| url = http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/22/news/companies/viacom/index.htm| accessdate = 2007-08-03 }}</ref> Despite HBO's exit from the venture, the [[Viacom Media Networks]] division in charge of Comedy Central is still called Comedy Partners, currently being a [[general partnership|partnership]] of [[Viacom International]], the operating subsidiary of Viacom of which Viacom Media Networks is a division, and Viacom Hearty Ha!

===1991–1997===
[[File:Comedy Central logo (1990s).svg|145px|thumb|The original Comedy Central logo used from 1991-2000. An earlier variant of this logo has the "Comedy Central" text bigger, almost taking up the marquee sign; that variant lasted until 1995.]]
From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, much of the [[broadcast programming|programming]] on Comedy Central and its predecessors consisted of [[comedy film]]s, sitcom reruns, half-hour specials, and clip shows featuring comedians. With the exception of the cult favorite ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success was ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]], which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Additionally, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' had got its start with original host [[Craig Kilborn]], although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction of [[Jon Stewart]] (who was former co-host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' from 1991).

''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'' was also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]''. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy group ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and British shows such as the U.K. edition of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' (the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcom ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. Some later seasons of ''"AbFab"'', as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle's ''[[Almost Live!]]'' between 1992 and 1993.

===1997–1999===
The channel made a breakthrough when ''[[South Park]]'' premiered in 1997. Being the first major basic cable show to carry the [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-MA]] rating for mature audiences, the show was too controversial to be picked up by a mainstream network.<ref name="nytsp">{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/business/media-broadcasting-comedy-central-makes-most-irreverent-profitable-new-cartoon.html | title=MEDIA: BROADCASTING; Comedy Central makes the most of an irreverent, and profitable, new cartoon hit | publisher=The New York Times | date=November 10, 1997 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Carter, Bill}}</ref> As [[word of mouth]] spread, the number of people who requested that Comedy Central be added to their cable providers increased, and the channel became available in over 50% of American homes by 1998.

===2000–2003===
[[File:Comedy Central logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|The network's second logo used from 2000-2010. It was used in the United Kingdom until 2012.]]
In October 2000, Comedy Central modernized its globe logo, by straightening the buildings, modernizing the globe, and removing the transmitter from the logo. The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1991 logo was said to "communicate the 1950s broadcast era". In 2002, [[Comedy Central Records]] was formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.<ref name="presscentral">{{cite web | url=http://press.cc.com/ | title=Home | publisher=Press Central | accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

Since 2003, Comedy Central has created a [[Comedy Central Roast|tradition]] of roasting comedians in the style of the [[New York Friars' Club]] roasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have included [[Denis Leary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml |title=Official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Jeff Foxworthy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_foxworthy/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Pamela Anderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_anderson/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[William Shatner]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_shatner/index.jhtml |title=Roast of Shatner |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Flavor Flav]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_flavor_flav/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Bob Saget]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_saget/index.jhtml |title=Official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Larry the Cable Guy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_larry/index.jhtml |title=Official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Joan Rivers]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[David Hasselhoff]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast-david-hasselhoff/index.jhtml |title=Official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Donald Trump]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[James Franco]], and [[Justin Bieber]].

====The ''Secret Stash''====
The success of ''South Park'', despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every Saturday and Sunday morning at 1 a.m. ET, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called the ''Secret Stash''. It premiered on July 4, 2003 with the unedited cable television debut of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, with the exception of limited nudity allowed in animated programs such as ''[[Drawn Together]]'', and [[Buttocks|rear nudity]].

===2004–2006===
In late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in ascending order, ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[Reno 911!]]''. Shortly thereafter, [[Dave Chappelle]] backed out of the much-anticipated third season of ''Chappelle's Show''.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10337064/ Comedy Central to air Chappelle remainders], [[MSNBC]], December 12, 2005.</ref> Meanwhile, ''The Daily Show'' continued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract for ''South Park'' and the launch of ''Daily Show'' spin-off ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', it was reported that ''South Park'' and ''The Daily Show'' were the two highest-[[Nielsen ratings|rated]] shows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chief [[Doug Herzog]] was reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons of ''South Park'' forever, and that ''The Colbert Report'' fulfilled a long-held plan to extend the ''Daily Show'' brand.

On April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" and "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", ''South Park'' touched the issue of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|recent protest]] over the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoon ''[[Family Guy]]''. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/04/13/165631-south-park-creators-skewer-own-network |title='South Park' Creators Skewer Own Network |publisher=Newsvine |date=April 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show's creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads, ''"In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision."'' An anonymous source close to the show indicated{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} that ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] were informed of the policy several weeks earlier, and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowed ''South Park'' to portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, "[[Super Best Friends]]". Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the "Cartoon Wars" episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to "Super Best Friends").

===2007–2010===
On January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe. The channel airs 33 shows either dubbed in German or subtitled while also airing locally produced shows.<ref>{{cite web | last =  Tzortzis | first = Andreas | title = Comedy Central plays to a German sense of humor |work=International Herald Tribune | date = February 18, 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/18/business/comedy.php | accessdate = 2007-08-03 }}</ref> On April 30, Dutch channel [[The Box Comedy|The Box]] was relaunched as the Dutch version of Comedy Central during the [[prime time|primetime]] and overnight hours timesharing with [[Nickelodeon (Netherlands)|Nickelodeon]].<ref>{{cite web|author=16.06 Europe/London, March 23, 2007 |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/today/?p=573 |title=Dutch launch for Comedy Central |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> On May 1, 2007, Comedy Central expanded to Italy, replacing [[Paramount Comedy]].<ref>http://www.broadcastclub.co.uk/sateuropa_forum/upload/viewtopic.php?pid=318</ref>

On June 27, 2007, [[CTVglobemedia]]-owned networks [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[The Comedy Network]] obtained the exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and current programs on all electronic platforms, under a multi-year agreement with [[Viacom]], expanding on past programming agreements between the two channels. Canadian users attempting to visit Comedy Central websites were redirected to The Comedy Network's website. The Canadian channel retains its own brand name, but the agreement is otherwise very similar to the earlier CTV/Viacom deal for [[MTV (Canada)|MTV in Canada]].<ref>[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/June2007/27/c9701.html CTV Strikes Multi-Platform Content Deal With Comedy Central], CTV press release, June 27, 2007</ref> As of 2011, this geocaching no longer applies and both the Comedy Central and The Comedy Network websites can be accessed worldwide, with the exception of videos which remain only accessible within each respective country.

In December 2007, Comedy Central picked up a show hosted by [[Lewis Black]] called ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil]]'',<ref>[http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/10/05/comedy-central-picks-up-lewis-blacks-show/ tvsquad.com] Comedy Central picks up Lewis Black's show</ref> which debuted in March 2008.

On March 27, 2008, the Swedish Radio and TV Authority approved an application from Comedy Central regarding being allowed to air television programs in Sweden. The grant allows Comedy Central to broadcast on the [[DVB-T|terrestrial]] television network between January 1, 2009 and March 31, 2014, after which a new request must be submitted in order to continue broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rtvv.se/se/Press/Nyheter/080327/ | title = Announcement regarding new DVB-T channels going live in Sweden on April 1, 2008  | accessdate = 2008-03-27}}</ref> Comedy Central's U.S. flagship network picked up a remake of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' hosted by [[Dave Attell]],<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-comedycentralgongshowdaveattell,0,4414601.story zap2it.com] Comedy Central Resurrects 'The Gong Show'</ref> star of his former self-titled Comedy Central series ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell|Insomniac]]'', which debuted in July 2008.

In June 2008, Comedy Central picked up the sketch comedy show ''[[Important Things with Demetri Martin]]'', which began airing in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iff0ec139962d42d4152b670707cce783 |title=Stewart stamp on 'Martin' |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=October 3, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> On April 1, 2009, Comedy Central began airing in New Zealand as channel 010 on [[SKY Network Television|SKY Digital]].

The network also played a role in the revival of the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', which [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] had cancelled in 2003. New episodes began airing on Comedy Central in 2010. But in May 2013, Comedy Central released a statement saying that the contract between Futurama and Comedy Central would not be renewed, and that the summer of 2013 would be Futurama's final season on the air. However, episodes continue to run daily on Comedy Central.<ref>[http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEqF9susTJPtut\ movieweb.com] Futurama Finally Returns with Brand New Episodes in June!</ref>

''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" aired in April 2010, revisiting the issue of the Islamic religious figure [[Muhammad]]'s perceived immunity to parody, for fear of violent retaliation. The Super Best Friends returned, but Muhammad was entirely covered by a black bar reading "CENSORED" through all of his screen time. By the second episode of the two-parter, Comedy Central decided to censor every instance of his name, as well as three entire monologues, from the end of the show. The monologues dealt with the subjects of censorship and intimidation, but did not actually use Muhammad's name. Parker and Stone have since issued a statement to the press, confirming that the "bleeps" were added weeks after the show was finished, and that Comedy Central has refused to let them post the original version to [[South Park Studios]], in addition to retroactively removing the original "Super Best Friends" episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/201_(South_Park)#cite_note-NYT_Arts_Blog-2 |title=201 (South Park) – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

===2011–present===
On December 10, 2010, Comedy Central introduced a new logo for the network that launched on January 1, 2011, which left behind the previous theme of a world-sized "tower" broadcasting the network/skyscrapers, in favor of an image of two "C"'s, with one of them and the word "Central" turned upside-down within the new logomark. The new logo was designed to represent the network's unique brand of comedy (with some drawing comparisons to the [[copyright symbol]] as inspiration for its design and use), and to provide the network with a logo that could be easily used across different platforms, such as social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/12/comedy_central_unveils_serious.html |title=Comedy Central Unveils Serious New Logo – Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/460888-Comedy_Central_Flips_With_New_Logo.php |title=Comedy Central Flips With New Logo – 2010-12-09 18:55:26 &#124; Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> The logo's resemblance to the one used by [[Federal Communications Commission]] has also been pointed out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662866/comedy-central-unveils-ironic-new-logo-and-nobody-gets-the-joke |title=Comedy Central Unveils Ironic New Logo, and Nobody Gets the Joke |publisher=fastcodedesign.com |first1=Suzanne |last1=Labarre |date=25 January 2012 |accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/comedy-central-new-logo-mcrid-91668/  |title=Comedy Central Rebrands Itself With New Logo, New Look |publisher=screenrant.com |first1=Michael |last1=Crider  |accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> It went on to win several industry awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelabnyc.com/blog/article/thelab-wins-awards |title=Thelab : thelog : |publisher=Thelabnyc.com |date=February 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> The company also standardised its publicity material and idents to use the fonts [[Brandon Grotesque]] and Eames Century Modern.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fonts in Use: Comedy Central|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/24/comedy-central|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>

On November 5, 2007, an open letter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videosift.com/talk/An-Open-Letter-to-Comedy-Central-and-Viacom |title=VideoSifts open letter to Comedy Central and Viacom |publisher=Videosift.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> was written by [[VideoSift]] to protesting the blocking of Comedy Central's embedded video content for non-U.S. based viewers.

On April 21, 2010, Comedy Central [[201 (South Park)#Censorship|censored]] the ''[[South Park]]'' episode, "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", in response to a [[death threat]] issued by users of a [[Revolution Muslim|radical Muslim website]] over the episode's planned depiction of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], which led several newspaper columnists to condemn the network's actions as tantamount to abetting terrorism. As a result, "201" and [[200 (South Park)|the episode that preceded it]] were heavily edited and not shown in repeats.
