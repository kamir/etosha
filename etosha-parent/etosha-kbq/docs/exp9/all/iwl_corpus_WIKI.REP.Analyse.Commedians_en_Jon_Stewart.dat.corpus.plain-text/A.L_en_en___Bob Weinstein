'''Robert''' "'''Bob'''" '''Weinstein''' (born October 18, 1954) is an American film producer. He is the founder and head of [[Dimension Films]], former co-chairman of [[Miramax Films]], and current head, with his brother [[Harvey Weinstein]], of [[The Weinstein Company]]. Of the two Weinstein brothers, Bob has a reputation as the quieter of the two, and has focused on making commercially successful action and horror films.<ref name=NYDailyNews>Ross, Barbara (April 6, 2012).

==Career==
After graduating from college, Weinstein, along with his brother [[Harvey Weinstein]], independently produced rock concerts as Harvey & Corky Productions in Buffalo through most of the 1970s.<ref name=biskind>{{cite book|title=Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film |last=Biskind |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Biskind |year=2004|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= |isbn=0-684-86259-X |pages=463–464 |url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&pid=502917}}</ref><ref name=Mason>{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Ian Garrick|title = When Harvey met Mickey|publisher=New Statesman|date=October 11, 2004|url = http://www3.sympatico.ca/ian.g.mason/Harvey_Weinstein.htm|accessdate=January 11, 2007}}</ref> Both Weinstein brothers had grown up with a passion for movies and they nurtured a desire to enter the film industry.  In the late 1970s, using profits from their concert promotion business, the brothers created a small independent film distribution company called [[Miramax]], named after their parents – Miriam and Max.  The company's first releases were primarily music-oriented concert films such as [[Paul McCartney]]'s ''[[Rockshow]]''.  In the early 1980s Miramax acquired the rights to two British films of benefit shows filmed for human rights organization [[Amnesty International]].  Working closely with [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] the producer of the original films, the Weinstein brothers edited the two films into one movie tailored for the American market. The resulting film was released as ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in May 1982 and it became Miramax's first hit. The movie raised considerable sums for [[Amnesty International]] and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the US.

The Weinsteins slowly built upon this success throughout the 1980s with arthouse films that achieved critical attention and modest commercial success. Harvey Weinstein and Miramax gained wider attention in 1988 with the release of [[Errol Morris]]'s documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' which detailed the struggle of [[Randall Adams]], a wrongfully convicted inmate sentenced to [[death row]]. The publicity that soon surrounded the case resulted in the release of Adams and nationwide publicity for Miramax. The following year, their successful launch release of [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' propelled Miramax to become the most successful independent studio in America.

Miramax continued to grow its library of films and directors until, in 1993, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] offered Harvey and Bob $60 million for ownership of Miramax.  Agreeing to the deal that would cement their Hollywood clout and ensure that they would remain at the head of their company, Miramax followed the next year with their first blockbuster, [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.

1996 brought Miramax's first [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] with the victory of ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.  This would start a string of critical successes that would include ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' and ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.

On March 29, 2005, it was announced that the Weinstein brothers would leave Miramax on September 30 and would form their own production company, [[The Weinstein Co.]]

==Personal life==
Weinstein has been married twice. He has two daughters from his first marriage. Weinstein married Anne Clancy, a former book editor, in 2000. They have two children, a boy and a girl, and lived in a large townhouse on the Upper West Side. Anne filed for divorce in April 2012, and sought a protective order because she feared "bodily harm." Weinstein issued a statement from Don Sloane, a Washington-based interventionist who denied that Weinstein was a danger to his wife, and who said that Annie was reacting to a family intervention conducted to address her alcoholism. Anne's lawyers denied that their client suffered from any addiction, and said that Sloane's statement was from Weinstein's paid agent, who had never met Anne Weinstein.<ref name=NYDailyNews/>
