The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] reported that the occupation typically did not require related work experience or a high school diploma, that on-the-job training was short term, and that the median income in 2012 for the position was $18,500.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://data.bls.gov/projections/occupationProj | title=Employment Projections|publisher=United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2014-06-12}} Occupation data is listed under "Dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers" (job titles are hidden by default).</ref>

The duties of bussers fall under the heading of ''busing'' or ''bussing'', an [[American English|Americanism]] of unknown origin.<ref name="col" />

==Job description==
Primary functions of the busser are to clean and reset tables, carry dishes and other tableware to the kitchen, serve items such as water, coffee and bread, replenish supplies of linens, tableware and trays, and assist [[Waiting staff|servers]] with clearing plates and other areas of table service.<ref name="onet">{{cite web | url=http://www.onetonline.org/find/score/35-9011.00?s=bus%20cleaner|title=Keyword Relevance for: bus cleaner|work=O*Net OnLine|publisher=O*Net}}</ref><ref name=cia/> Other tasks include cleaning and polishing fixtures, walls, furniture and equipment, cleaning tableware, cleaning food service areas, mopping and vacuuming floors, cleaning up spills, removing empty bottles and trash, and scraping and stacking dirty dishes.<ref name="onet" />

==Etiquette==
One guide to manners advised that bussers should not speak or interrupt those being served, and to simply refill glasses at the table rather than asking if customers would like more water.<ref name="Boswell2007">{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=Sandra|title=Protocol Matters: Cultivating Social Graces in Christian Homes and Schools|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3szmEBlEmIUC&pg=PA98|year=2007|publisher=Canon Press & Book Service|isbn=978-1-59128-025-5|page=98}}</ref> Likewise, it advises customers against engaging bussers and waiting staff in distracting conversations, as they are often busy.<ref name="Boswell2007"/> A business etiquette guide suggests that customers should refer to bussers and waiting staff with the [[Gender-neutral language|gender-neutral]] terms ''busser'' and ''server'' rather than ''waiter'' or ''busboy''.<ref name="Mitchell2000">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Mary|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Business Etiquette|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7NwjTfyNIFgC&pg=PA186|year=2000|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-0-02-863615-3|page=186}}</ref> It also says that bussers are the employee and must inform if items like a water glass or piece of flatware is missing.<ref name="Mitchell2000"/>

==Tip income==
Bussers are not traditionally tipped directly in the United States, but restaurants may employ "tip pooling" or "tip sharing" arrangements, in which a portion of servers' tips are shared with other restaurant service staff.<ref name="sunsent2011"/>

In the United States, tip sharing may be either voluntary, where waitstaff give a portion of their tips to coworkers as they see fit, or mandatory, where the employer sets a formula by which tips must be shared with coworkers such as bussers and bartenders.<ref name="sunsent2011"/> Federal Department of Labor regulations do not allow restaurants to include managers in tip sharing, and inclusion of "back of the house" employees such as dishwashers and cooks has been the subject of legal disputes since 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonbusiness.com/articles/94-january-2011/4584-tip-pool-ruling-cuts-restaurant-costs|date=2010-12-16|title=Tip pool ruling cuts restaurant costs|first=Peter|last=Beland|work=Oregon Business}}</ref><ref name="Descherer2013">{{cite book|last=Descherer|first=Dorinda D.|title=Wage Hour Compliance Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vnZWAgAAQBAJ&pg=SA3-PA31|edition=2014|year=2013|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=978-1-4548-3419-9|pages=3{{hyphen}}31–3{{hyphen}}32}}</ref> Recipients of tips in shared tip restaurants may be paid a "tip-credit wage", below the ordinary minimum wage in the United States, if the amount of shared tips in a pay period brings their average pay to the minimum wage.<ref name="sunsent2011"/> Federal subminimum wage is set at $2.13 per hour, though state and local laws may require higher rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/opinion/FLSA/2009/2009_01_15_12_FLSA.htm|title=Wage and Hour Division (WHD): Opinion Letters - Fair Labor Standards Act|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> California, for example, requires tipped employees be paid full minimum wage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_tipsandgratuities.html|title=Tips and Gratuities|publisher=Department of Industrial Relations, State of California|accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

A spokesperson for restaurant operator [[Darden Restaurants]], which incorporated tip-sharing in 2011 at their [[Olive Garden]] and [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]] chains, said that it was more consistent and fair "to recognize everyone who delivers a guest experience", and noted that the lower hourly base wage for bartenders and bussers offered "the opportunity to ultimately earn more", depending on a restaurant's volume of tips.<ref name="sunsent2011"/>
