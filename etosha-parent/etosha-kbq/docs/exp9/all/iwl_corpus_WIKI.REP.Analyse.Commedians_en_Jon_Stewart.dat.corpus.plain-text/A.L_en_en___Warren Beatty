'''Henry Warren Beaty''', known professionally as '''Warren Beatty''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|t|i}} {{respell|BAY|tee}};<ref>CMU pronouncing dictionary [http://dictionary.infoplease.com/beatty Random House Unabridged Dictionary] and [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939844,00.html Time magazine], but {{IPA|/ˈbiːti/}} {{respell|BEE|tee}} according to the [http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict?in=warren+beatty CMU Pronouncing Dictionary].<!-- so far no source has been found indicating Beatty's personal opinion --></ref> born March 30, 1937) is an American actor, producer, screenwriter and director.

Beatty is only the second person to have been nominated for acting, directing, writing and producing in the same film – doing so first with ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978), and again with ''Reds''- succeeding [[Orson Welles]], who was nominated for all four for [[Citizen Kane]] in 1941, winning for writing.

In 1999, he was awarded the Academy's highest honor, the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award|Irving G. Thalberg Award]]. Beatty has been nominated for eighteen [[Golden Globe Award]]s, winning six, including the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]], which he was honored with in 2007. Among his Golden Globe-nominated films are ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'' (1961), ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[Bugsy]]'' (1991), and ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998).

==Early life==
Henry Warren Beaty was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. His mother, Kathlyn Corinne (née MacLean), was a [[Nova Scotia]]-born teacher, and his father, Ira Owens Beaty, had a PhD in educational psychology, was a public school administrator, and dealt in real estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/59/Warren-Beatty.html|title=Warren Beatty profile|publisher=FilmReference.com}}</ref> Beatty's grandparents were also educators.

He is not related to [[Ned Beatty]] (who was also born in 1937).

===Education===
Beatty was a star [[American football|football]] player at [[Washington-Lee High School]] in Arlington. Encouraged to act by the success of his sister, who had recently established herself as a Hollywood star, he decided to work as a stagehand at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in Washington, D.C. during the summer before his senior year. He was reportedly offered ten football scholarships to college, but rejected them to study liberal arts at [[Northwestern University]] (1954–1955), where he joined the [[Sigma Chi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. After his first year, he left college to move to New York City, where he studied acting with [[Stella Adler]].

===Military service===
Warren Beatty enlisted in the California [[Air National Guard]] on February 11, 1960 under his original name, Henry W. Beaty. On January 1, 1961, Beatty was discharged from the Air National Guard due to physical disability. He was simultaneously discharged from the [[United States Air Force Reserve]] (USAF), and served on inactive duty only.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Career==

===1950s and 1960s===
[[File:BonnieClyde67TrailerSitBumper.JPG|thumb|left|Beatty in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967).]]
Beatty started his career making appearances on television shows such as ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'' (1957), ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'' (1957), and ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' (1959). He was a semi-regular on ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'' during its first season (1959–60). His performance in [[William Inge]]'s ''A Loss of Roses'' on Broadway in 1960 garnered him a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actor and a 1960 [[Theatre World Award]]. It was his sole appearance on Broadway. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} He made his film debut in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'' (1961), opposite [[Natalie Wood]]. The film was a critical and box office success and Beatty was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]], and received the award for [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor|New Star of the Year – Actor]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

He followed his initial film with [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone]]'' (1961), with [[Vivien Leigh]] and [[Lotte Lenya]], directed by [[José Quintero|Jose Quintero]]; ''[[All Fall Down (film)|All Fall Down]]'' (1962), with [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Karl Malden]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]], directed by [[John Frankenheimer]]; ''[[Lilith (film)|Lilith]]'' (1963), with [[Jean Seberg]] and [[Peter Fonda]], directed by [[Robert Rossen]]; ''[[Promise Her Anything]]'' (1964), with [[Leslie Caron]], [[Bob Cummings]] and [[Keenan Wynn]], directed by [[Arthur Hiller]]; ''[[Mickey One]]'' (1965), with [[Alexandra Stewart]] and [[Hurd Hatfield]], directed by [[Arthur Penn]]; and ''[[Kaleidoscope (1966 film)|Kaleidoscope]]'' (1966), with [[Susannah York]] and [[Clive Revill]], directed by [[Jack Smight]].

In 1967, when he was 29 years old, he produced and acted in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. He assembled a team that included the writers [[Robert Benton]] and [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David Newman]] and the director [[Arthur Penn]], chose [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Estelle Parsons]] for lead roles, oversaw the script and spearheaded the delivery of the film. It was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for ten [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and seven [[Golden Globe Award]]s, including Best Picture and Best Actor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===1970s and 1980s===
[[File:Nancy Reagan with Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Beatty with [[Diane Keaton]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] in 1981.]]
After ''Bonnie and Clyde'', Beatty acted with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[The Only Game in Town (film)|The Only Game in Town]]'' (1970), directed by George Stevens; ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), directed by [[Robert Altman]]; ''[[$ (film)|Dollars]]'' (1971), directed by Richard Brooks; ''[[The Parallax View]]'' (1974), directed by [[Alan Pakula]]; and ''[[The Fortune]]'' (1975), directed by [[Mike Nichols]]. Beatty produced, co-wrote and acted in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), directed by [[Hal Ashby]], which was nominated for four Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], as well as five Golden Globe Awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]] and Best Actor. In 1978, Beatty directed, produced, wrote and acted in ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978). The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Adapted Screenplay. It also won three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor.

Beatty's next film was ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), an historical epic about the Communist journalist [[John Silas Reed|John Reed]] who observed the Russian [[October Revolution]] – a project Beatty had begun researching and filming for as far back as 1970. It was a critical and commercial success (made all the more noticeable considering it was an American film about an American Communist, made and released at the height of the Cold War). It received twelve Academy Award nominations – including four for Beatty (for Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Original Screenplay), winning three; Beatty won for Best Director, [[Maureen Stapleton]] won for Best Supporting Actress (playing anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]), and [[Vittorio Storaro]] won for Best Cinematography. The film received seven Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay. Beatty won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]]. Following ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', Beatty did not appear in a film for five years until his comeback in 1987's ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', written and directed by [[Elaine May]]. Following severe criticism in press reviews by the new British studio chief [[David Puttnam]] just prior to its release, the film received mixed reviews and was commercially unsuccessful. Puttnam attacked several other overbudget U.S. films greenlit by his predecessor, and was fired shortly thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===1990s and 2000s===
[[File:Warren Beatty as Dick Tracy.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Beatty on the set of ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990).]]
In 1990, Beatty produced, directed and played the title role as [[comic strip]] based detective [[Dick Tracy]] in the [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|film of the same name]]. The film received critical acclaim and was one of the highest grossing of the year. It received seven [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning three for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]; it also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, including Best Motion Picture. 

In 1991, he produced and starred as the real-life gangster [[Bugsy Siegel]] in the critically and commercially acclaimed ''[[Bugsy]]'', directed by [[Barry Levinson]], which was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor; it later won two of the awards for Best Art Direction and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. The film also received eight Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor, winning for Best Motion Picture. Beatty's next film, ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'' (1994), directed by [[Glenn Caron]], received mixed reviews and was unimpressive commercially. In 1998, he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the [[political satire]] ''[[Bulworth]]'', which was critically acclaimed and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. The film also received three Golden Globe Award nominations, for Best Motion Picture, Actor, and Screenplay.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Beatty has appeared briefly in numerous documentaries, including: ''Arthur Penn, 1922–: Themes and Variants'' (1970), ''Year of the Woman'' (1973), ''George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey'' (1984), ''Dick Tracy: Behind the Badge, Behind the Scenes'' (1990), ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare]]'' (1991), ''Bugsy: The Dark Passion of an American Dreamer'' (1991), ''Victory & Valor: Special Olympics World Games'' (1991), ''Writing With Light: Vittorio Storaro'' (1992), ''The First 100 Years: A Celebration of American Movies'' (1995), ''Forever Hollywood'' (1999), ''Dean Tavoularis: The Magician of Hollywood'' (2003), ''[[One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern|One Bright Shining Moment]]'' (2005), ''The Road to Damascus: The Reinvention of Bugsy Siegel'' (2006), ''In Search of Puppy Love'' (2007), ''American Masters'' (2008), and ''Revolution! The Making of Bonnie and Clyde'' (2008).

===2010s===
In 2010, Beatty directed and reprised his role as Dick Tracy in a 30-minute film titled ''Dick Tracy Special'', which premiered on [[Turner Classic Movie|TCM]]. The short [[metafiction]] film stars comic strip hero, [[Dick Tracy]] (played by Beatty) and [[film critic]] and historian [[Leonard Maltin]] who talks about the history and creation of Tracy. Maltin also interviews Dick Tracy. Tracy talks about how he admired [[Ralph Byrd]] and [[Morgan Conway]] who portrayed him in several films, but how he didn't care much for Beatty's portrayal of him nor [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|his film]].

In June 2011, it was reported that Beatty was developing a film based on [[Howard Hughes]]. The story of Hughes was a dream project Beatty planned to make since the 1970s. Beatty identified himself with Hughes and unlike many roles he played, he was reported saying that he thought he was the appropriate actor to play Hughes (as well as playing [[Bugsy Siegel]], a role he eventually played in ''[[Bugsy]]''). In the mid-1970s, Beatty signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] to star, produce, write and possibly direct a film about Hughes. It was also during this period that Beatty approached [[Paul Schrader]] to write a script on Hughes' life, which he declined. However, the project was put on hold when Beatty began ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''. Initially, Beatty planned to film the life story of [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and Hughes back-to-back, but as he was getting deeper into the project, he eventually focused primarily only on the John Reed film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. 

In the mid-1980s, Beatty postponed the Hughes film to film ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' with Hoffman and May. After finishing the ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' draft in the late 1980s, Beatty pursued [[Bo Goldman]] (who wrote a Howard Hughes-themed script ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'' which also earned him an [[Academy Award]]) to write a Hughes script for Warners by the end of 1990. It was during this collaboration with Goldman that Beatty decided to make a film about the later life of Hughes, which Beatty found more fascinating. Although many speculated{{Who|date=December 2014}} that Beatty never had a script about Hughes, it was reported that Goldman did hand Beatty the script on Hughes in the summer of 1989 and he was pleased with the script, but Beatty went on to other projects. However, in the early 1990s, Beatty got word that [[Steven Spielberg]] approached Goldman to write him another script on Howard Hughes for Spielberg to direct, in which Spielberg wanted [[Jack Nicholson]] to play the billionaire aviator. Beatty convinced Nicholson to turn down the part and Spielberg eventually moved on to other projects. Although Beatty continued to work on the Hughes script himself in 1995, Beatty moved on to ''[[Bulworth]]'', shelving his Hughes project once again.

However, after years of being away from the screen and the camera, it was reported that Beatty is producing, writing, directing and starring in a film about Hughes and an affair he had with a younger woman in the final years of his life. The project also includes an ensemble cast. During this period, Beatty approached [[Andrew Garfield]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Shia La Beouf]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Rooney Mara]], his wife [[Annette Bening]] and his personal choice of the female lead, [[Felicity Jones]], to join the cast. After [[Paramount Pictures]] exited the film, [[Regency Enterprises]] picked up the film in September 2011. The film, ''[[Untitled Warren Beatty project]]'', began [[principal photography]] on February 24, 2014 and wrapped on June 8, 2014. Some have said that Beatty's film is 40 years in the making.

===Tribune lawsuit===
In May 2005, Beatty sued [[Tribune Co.]], claiming he still maintained the rights to ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. On March 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson ruled in Beatty's favor.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090321/film_nm/us_tribune_dicktracy;_ylt=Al4G_LVoc_fVEVoQpxMqS_5xFb8C Beatty Sues Tribune Over ''Dick Tracy'' Rights], ''Yahoo News'', March 21, 2009 {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

===Unrealized projects===
Throughout his career, Warren Beatty had several projects that he wanted to produce, to star and to possibly direct. In 1963, producer [[Charles K. Feldman|Charlie Feldman]] approached Beatty to star and to co-produce a [[screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]] based on a Hungarian play called ''Lot's Wife'', which was penned by [[Billy Wilder's]] writing partner, [[I.A.L. Diamond]] (Feldman had prior knowledge of Beatty's ambition of becoming a film producer). Beatty agreed to participate in the project and ''Lot's Wife'' evolved into ''What's New Pussycat?''. The title comes from Beatty, who would answer the phone to female callers with "What's New Pussycat?" It was intended that Beatty would play the film's hero, a notorious lovesick womanizer and for then-little known writer [[Woody Allen]] to play the film's secondary role (which would have been his film debut). Beatty originally wanted [[Groucho Marx]] to play Beatty's character's psychiatrist in the film. The role would have been a juicy part and the funniest in the film, and a comeback for Marx's career. During the writing phase of the film, Beatty suggested that maybe [[Mike Nichols]] should direct this film. Nichols hadn't yet directed a feature film up to that time. Both Beatty and Allen wrote several drafts for ''Pussycat''. However, Beatty became increasingly upset that Allen began to increase his part to the point where Allen's character had the best, funniest lines in the script. Beatty took his case to Feldman to denounce Allen's involvement in the project. Despite their collaboration, Feldman sided with Allen, partly because Allen's version of the script was funnier than Beatty's. Unhappy with the direction of where the screenplay was going, Beatty left the project. Ultimately, ''What's New Pussycat?'' was released without Beatty's involvement and, although Woody Allen did get the writing credit, it was reported that he was not satisfied with the end results. The character that Beatty would have played in the film was portrayed by [[Peter O'Toole]], and Marx's role was played by [[Peter Sellers]]. Despite their disputes on the film, both Beatty and Feldman reconciled and remained friends until Feldman's death in 1968. Although not happy on how the film was made, both Beatty and Allen went on their own careers and both understood that when developing their own projects, they must have total control over them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In the mid-1960s, while touring in France with then-girlfriend [[Leslie Caron]], Beatty approached the film director [[François Truffaut]] and proposed to him to direct a film on the life of French singer [[Édith Piaf]] which would star Caron as Piaf. Beatty would have produced the project. Truffaut declined the offer. As soon as Beatty returned to New York, he got word that a hot, sharp script by two young writers [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David Newman]] and [[Robert Benton]] was being presented. The script was about [[Bonnie and Clyde]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

During pre-production on ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', Beatty continued to look for future projects. During that time, he was toying with the idea of remaking the [[Jean Renoir]] film ''[[The Lower Depths (1936 film)|The Lower Depths]]''. However, the idea of remaking Renoir's film was quickly abandoned when Beatty, with the suggestion of his friend and idol [[Cary Grant]], went on to look for/think of a romantic comedy to make. Eight years later, Beatty's "romantic comedy" led him to produce, co-write and star in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]''.

After the release of ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and while writing the script of ''Shampoo'', Beatty, who was fascinated in "everything Russia", visited the [[Soviet Union]] several times with then-girlfriend [[Julie Christie]]. It was during those trips when Beatty took interest in the life of the American Communist journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. During that time, it was also reported that Beatty had written a screenplay called ''Natural State'' which was about a love affair between an American man and a Russian woman set during the height of the [[Cold War]]. The ''Natural State'' screenplay remained unrealized and Beatty eventually made [[Reds (film)|the film about John Reed]] thirteen years later.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Beatty intended for ''Reds'' to be his first feature as director, but Beatty nearly stepped into the role of a director of two films that he starred in in the 1970s. During production of ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'', Beatty didn't like the direction [[Robert Altman]] was taking. Beatty re-wrote his own scenes and lines as well as Julie Christie's scenes and lines. Beatty wanted to take control of the film and to direct the film himself due to Altman's lack of skill (according to Beatty). However, Altman resumed his position as director and Beatty resumed his original position as well. A few years later, during the pre-production of ''[[The Fortune]]'', Beatty was eager to work with [[Jack Nicholson]] for the first time, and Beatty toyed with the idea of directing the film. Beatty originally thought of directing the film as a [[silent film|silent feature]], as an homage to the silent comedies of [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Mack Sennett]]. Eventually, Mike Nichols was chosen to be the film's director.

Also in the 1970s, according to [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]], Evans approached Beatty to star in the title role of ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]''. But like many well-known actors during that time, Beatty turned down the part. However, Beatty was more interested in taking control of the film by being its producer and to direct Gatsby. Beatty thought that Evans should play the part of Gatsby (Evans started his career as an actor) who Beatty thought would be ideal. Beatty also envisioned Evan's ex-wife [[Ali MacGraw]] to play Daisy. Eventually, Beatty moved on to other projects, and ''The Great Gatsby'' starred [[Robert Redford]] and [[Mia Farrow]].

In 1975, after the release of ''Shampoo'', screenwriter [[Paul Schrader]] approached Beatty to star in a script he had written, ''[[Hardcore (1979 film)|Hardcore]]''. Beatty was interested in being involved in the film, and even thought of being the producer of the film as well as maybe taking the role of director. Beatty eventually, passed on the film and went on to direct ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''. While preparing ''Heaven Can Wait'', Beatty met screenwriter [[James Toback]], who showed Beatty a new script he had written entitled ''[[Love and Money (film)|Love and Money]]''. Beatty expressed interest, but eventually, after finishing ''Heaven Can Wait'', Beatty placed his whole attention on making ''Reds''. Beatty also flirted with the idea of starting in Fosse's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''.

In the 1980s, Beatty had several projects he rejected and considered making. Beatty considered starring in Robert Towne's film ''[[Tequila Sunrise (film)|Tequila Sunrise]]'', as well as another project written by Towne titled ''Mermaid'', which would have been directed by [[Arthur Penn]]. Beatty was also pursued by filmmaker [[Paul Mazursky]] to star in his film ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'', but Beatty turned it down. In the late 1980s, after finishing ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' and producing ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-Up Artist]]'', Beatty bought the rights to produce the life of Warhol superstar [[Edie Sedgwick]]. Although, he would not have an acting role in the film, Beatty wanted to direct it and he co-wrote a script with James Toback, entitled ''Edie''. The film would have been about the rise of Sedgwick's fame in the 1960s and how her [[Svengali]]-like relationship with [[Andy Warhol]], her troubled romance with [[Bob Dylan]] and her drug abuse led her to her downfall in the 1970s. Beatty wanted the film to have a documentary feel. He only wanted to use hand-held cameras, [[8 mm film|8mm cameras]] in some scenes, and black and white stock in the film. At the time, Beatty considered [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] to play Sedgwick and [[Al Pacino]] to play Warhol. However, the pre-production of the film was halted with constant decision changing. During casting, Beatty thought that maybe he wasn't appropriate to be the film's director. Beatty asked [[Bob Fosse]] if he would direct the film. When Fosse passed on the film, Pfeiffer moved on to do other films. Beatty later considered either [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Jessica Lange]] or [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] to play Sedgwick. Beatty eventually cancelled ''Edie'' and went on to direct and star in ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''.

In the 1990s, Beatty starred in ''Dick Tracy'', ''[[Bugsy]]'' and ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'', and was in talks of starring in films such as ''[[Jade (film)|Jade]]'', ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (who briefly considered producing and possibly direct, as well), ''[[The Doctor (1991 film)|The Doctor]]'', ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', which Beatty admits he regrets not being in. During this time, Beatty found a script titled ''Ocean of Storms''. It was a romance about an older astronaut who rejoins in the space program for another shot at glory and falls for a female astronaut. The script was written by documentary producer Ben Young Mason and writer-actor [[Tony Bill]]. Beatty bought the rights to the script and pitched the film to [[20th Century Fox]]. However, like most of Beatty projects, it was stalled in development. After completing ''Love Affair'', Beatty wanted himself and [[Annette Bening]] to star in ''Ocean of Storms'' as their next project. He tried to convince [[Martin Scorsese]] to direct it. Scorsese passed on the project, but Beatty continued to develop it over the years, with rewrites from several screenwriters including Robert Towne, [[Lawrence Wright]] and [[Aaron Sorkin]]. In 1999, [[Clint Eastwood]] and Warner Bros. had released their own astronaut film ''[[Space Cowboys]]''. After the success of that film, and the disappointing box office success of both ''Love Affair'' and ''[[Bulworth]]'', Beatty pulled the plug on ''Ocean of Storms''.

In the early 2000s, Beatty thought of making a sequel to ''Bulworth'' called ''Bulworth 2000'' in which the plot would have started a few minutes after the events of the end of ''Bulworth''. ''Bulworth 2000'' was intended to satirize the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], but the film never came to fruition. ''Bulworth 2000'' was not the only sequel Beatty considered making. For years, he was thinking of making a sequel to both ''Shampoo'' and ''Dick Tracy'', but nothing came of it. Also, during the 2000s, Beatty was asked to play the title role in [[Quentin Tarantino]] revenge epic ''[[Kill Bill]]'', which would have had Beatty as Bill, a [[James Bond]]-like character. Beatty passed on the film but suggested Tarantino ask martial arts star [[David Carradine]] to play the part. Beatty also turned down another chance to play [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''.

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, Warren Beatty expressed an interest in producing, adapting and possibly directing a film based on [[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace|Scott Thorson's book on his romance with Liberace]]. His intention was to make a twisted [[black comedy]]-romance/showbiz satire with lots of music. Beatty toyed with the idea of either casting [[Michael Douglas]], [[Bill Murray]] or [[Robin Williams]] to play [[Liberace]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] to play [[Scott Thorson]]. Beatty also talked to several actors about being in the film, such as [[Oliver Platt]] to play Liberace's agent, [[Seymour Heller]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Liberace's mother (which would have been the first time that the brother and sister would have worked together in a film), and in a small comic role, [[Johnny Depp]] as Liberace's drug addicted plastic surgeon. Thorson's book was eventually made into an [[Behind the Candelabra|HBO original movie]]. Despite some casting conversations and writing a draft, Beatty eventually dropped the project and began to slowly work on ''[[Untitled Warren Beatty project]]''.

==Political work==
In 1972, Beatty was part of the "inner circle" of Senator George McGovern's [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|presidential campaign]]. He traveled extensively and was instrumental in organizing fundraising.<ref>McGovern, George S., ''Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern'', New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 172–3, 178</ref>
