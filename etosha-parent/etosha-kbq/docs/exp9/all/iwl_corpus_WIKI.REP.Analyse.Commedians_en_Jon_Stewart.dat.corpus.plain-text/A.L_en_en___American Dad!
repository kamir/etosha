'''''American Dad!''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]], and [[Matt Weitzman]] for the "[[Animation Domination]]" lineup on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].<ref name="autogenerated2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/04/24/interview-the-creators-of-american-dad |title=Interview: The Creators of American Dad |publisher=IGN |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref><ref name="avclub4">{{cite web|author=Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012 |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/comedy-showrunners-week-american-dads-cocreators-o,85507/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: American Dad's co-creators on the show's weird evolution &#124; TV &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

[[creative director|Creative direction]] of ''American Dad!'' has largely been guided by Barker (until concluding production of season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane. This is believed to have resulted in a series that is distinguishable from its counterparts.<ref name="doorly1">{{cite web|author=Sean Doorly |url=http://www.doorly.com/writing/seth-macfarlane.htm |title=Seth MacFarlane Interview |publisher=Doorly.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref> Unlike its sister shows, ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', ''American Dad!'' is not filled with intentional humor, such as through the use of repeated [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] and other blatant [[joke]]-telling deliveries;<ref name="avclub4" /> rather its humor is subtler, focusing on the nuttiness and oddities of its characters and their circumstances. As opposed to joke references to every [[pop cultural]] target possible—a staple of MacFarlane's ''Family Guy'' material—Barker and Weitzman have structured ''American Dad!'' so as to center on a bizarre concept in combination with an everyday-life human story that grounds it.<ref name="autogenerated2006" /> While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the execution tends to enter into wild and crazy extremes, thus an [[observational comedy]] or [[farce]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012 |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/comedy-showrunners-week-american-dads-cocreators-o,85507/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: American Dad's co-creators on the show's weird evolution &#124; TV &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

''American Dad!'' has been nominated for numerous awards, most prominently two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and two [[Annie Award]]s. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]. Since its debut, ''American Dad!'' has broadcast [[List of American Dad! episodes|187 episodes]]. The total number of seasons and organization of episodes within these seasons are in dispute because of a discrepancy in how official sources [[American Dad!#Season number discrepancies and episode misreports|report this information]]. One model suggests the first season of ''American Dad!'' comprises the first 7 episodes, while another model suggests the first season comprises 23 episodes.<ref name="autogenerated8">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/13/seth-macfarlanes-tv-history?page=2 |title=Seth MacFarlane's TV History |publisher=IGN |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>

==Plot==
The series focuses on the eccentric [[upper middle class]] Smith family in [[Northern Virginia]] and their three housemates:<ref name="avclub4" /> Father, husband, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent, Republican, and [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]] [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]]; his wife and homemaker/[[housewife]], [[Francine Smith]]; their college-aged daughter, [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley Smith]]; and their high-school-aged son, [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve Smith]]. Outside of the Smith family, there are three additional main characters, including Hayley's boyfriend turned husband, [[Jeff Fischer (American Dad!)|Jeff Fischer]]; the family's man-in-a-[[goldfish]]-body pet, [[Klaus Heissler|Klaus]]; and [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]], the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]], who is "[[Roger (American Dad!)#Disguises and alter egos|full of masquerades]], [[wikt: brazen|brazenness]], and shocking antics".<ref name="ovguide1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/roger-9202a8c04000641f80000000008d8419 |title=Roger Video &#124; Movie Clips & Character Interview |publisher=Ovguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-09}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news|last=McEwen |first=Lauren |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/american-dad-one-of-the-most-sophisticated-mainstream-shows-on-african-american-culture/2012/10/08/e8374cba-051d-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html |title='American Dad': One of the most sophisticated mainstream shows on African American culture - The Root DC Live |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref>

==Characters==
{{main|List of American Dad! characters}}

''American Dad!'' centers on the absurd circumstances, adventures and domestic life of its [[title role|title character]]
[[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]], his [[immediate family]], and their three housemates. Adding to all the ridiculousness and absurdity are the various [[Trait theory#List of personality traits|personality traits]] of all the show's eccentric main characters, listed as follows:

* [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] is the exaggeratedly [[masculinity|masculine]] husband of Francine and father of Steve and Hayley. Though Hayley may not be Stan's [[family (biology)|biological daughter]]—Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a [[bachelorette party]] in the episode "[[American Dad (season 8)|The Kidney Stays in the Picture]]"—Stan still regards her as such and refused to learn the results of a [[DNA]] test.<ref name="tvmuse1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvmuse.eu/tv-shows/American-Dad_49/season_7/episode_16/ |title=Watch American Dad - Season 7 Episode 16: The Kidney Stays In The Picture |publisher=Tvmuse.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}</ref> As the Smith family's breadwinner, Stan is an agent for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Tending to take extreme measures with no regard for others nor potentially disastrous consequences, Stan is portrayed as insanely drastic; endangering; rash; [[wikt: dog eat dog|dog-eat-dog]]; and both inconsiderate and insensitive of others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:O9FVjvQjOnMJ:whysoblu.com/american-dad-volume-6-dvd-review/+Stan+Smith+American+Dad+inconsiderate&cd=13&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |title=American Dad – Volume 6 (DVD Review) at Why So Blu? |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5oVWByE1PzEJ:www.plentyquotes.com/tvseries/American-Dad/American-Dad-16.html+American+Dad+insensitive+Stan+Smith&hl=en&gl=us&strip=1 |title=American Dad quotes - page 16 |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2013-02-07 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Early on in the series, Stan's mentality was that of a staunchly [[Neoconservatism in the United States|neoconservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and self-proclaimed American patriot.<ref name="awn.com">{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown |title=American Dad Touchdown &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> His neoconservatism was expressed ludicrously with him often coming off as severely intolerant, [[wiktionary:self-abnegation|self-abnegating]], and wrongheaded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imemine98.com/dvdreviews/a/americandadv6.html |title=Tom's DVD Review Page - American Dad Volume 6 |publisher=Imemine98.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> His traits in this regard are largely limited to the first few seasons and have since largely worn off, with Stan progressing as a person throughout the course of the series.<ref name="avclub5">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-missing-kink,95977/ |title="The Missing Kink" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> All the same however, Stan has numerous alternate ways of taking drastic measures beyond politics. As examples—in the episode "[[American Dad (season 4)|Dope & Faith]]" when Stan found out one of his friends was an [[atheism|atheist]], he tried getting him to pray by blowing up his home, spreading the [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] at his restaurant, brainwashing his wife into thinking she was a lesbian, and taking his kids away; in the episode "[[American Dad (season 3)|I Can't Stan You]]", Stan evicted his entire neighborhood and his own family just for overhearing some of his neighbors gossiping about him behind his back; in the episode "[[American Dad (season 3)|Four Little Words]]", Stan framed his wife as a murderer all so as not to hear her say the words "I told you so"; etc.

* [[Francine Smith]] is Stan's [[housewife]] and mother of Hayley and Steve. Francine is often seen indignant, nagging and scolding her family (mostly Stan) over wrongdoings, sometimes even becoming berserk in these moments. Seemingly a voice of reason, Francine also nags at her family to uphold certain [[virtue]]s as well as over anything they engage in that is unwholesome or reprehensible;<ref name="avclub1">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/finger-lenting-good,90011/ |title="Finger Lenting Good" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> [[wikt: paradox|paradoxical]] in character however, it is right in the midst of her moralistic nagging that Francine displays total inelegance, inappropriateness, and impropriety. Sporadically, while engaged in moralizing others or just in general, she will randomly throw in remarks and behaviors that are in bad taste and lack all sense of propriety. In the episode [[Virtual In-Stanity]] for example, Francine calls up Stan nagging and lecturing him about his neglect of Steve to which Stan responds by hanging up on her. Francine then calls back, shrieking "Bitch, did you just hang up on me?!" Adding to her [[wikt: paradox|paradoxical]] nature, Francine's behaviors have been known to become downright fiendish, all the while trying to get her family to live more wholesomely and do what is right. Very random, Francine is also given to making wacky and peculiar asides out of nowhere. For example, in the episode "[[The Scarlett Getter]]", while Francine was engaged in an angry rant about Stan, she stated "Those two are stuck on each other like gum on a hot summer sidewalk on a summer afternoon. I'm sorry, I'm taking a [[creative writing]] class."

* [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley Smith]] is Stan and Francine's new-age [[hippie]] daughter. Despite being a married adult for much of the series, she still lives under her parents' roof along with her husband, Jeff. As revealed in the episode "[[American Dad (season 8)|The Kidney Stays in the Picture]]", she may or may not be Stan's biological daughter—Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a bachelorette party.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvmuse.eu/tv-shows/American-Dad_49/season_7/episode_16/ |title=Watch American Dad - Season 7, Episode 16: The Kidney Stays In The Picture |publisher=Tvmuse.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}</ref> Nonetheless, Stan still regards her as such.<ref name="tvmuse1" /> Hayley is passionate, insistent and vocal in her convictions. In mentality, she's portrayed as a [[Liberalism in the United States|far-left liberal]], what was originally intended to be the antithesis to her father's far right neoconservative mentality. These character traits were particularly emphasized in the show's beginnings but heavily toned down afterwards.<ref name="imemine1">{{cite web|url=http://imemine98.com/dvdreviews/a/americandadv6.html |title=Tom's DVD Review Page - American Dad Volume 6 |publisher=Imemine98.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref> [[Intuition (psychology)|Intuitive]] and [[insight]]ful, Hayley is able to instinctively grasp the hidden, inner, and obscure nature of situations. As examples, instantly upon entering the room in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Finger Lenting Good]]", she realizes what Stan and Steve are up to in trying to get Jeff to hug them so as to lose his finger for engaging in his [Jeff] vice.<ref name="avclub1"/> As another example, in the episode "[[Da Flippity Flop]]" when the essence of Klaus has entered Stan's body and taken control over it, he attempts to deceive Hayley and Francine into thinking he's truly Stan; however, Hayley instantaneously and halfheartedly acknowledges that it's Klaus.<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/da-flippity-flop,97154/ |title="Da Flippity Flop" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> At times, Hayley can be casually rude and insulting in attitude especially towards her brother, Steve, which can be described as sibling rivalry. Several [[story arc]]s have been used with regards to Hayley's romantic relationship to Jeff. Back when the two were dating, they had several breakups.

* [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve Smith]] is the [[wikt: baby of the family|baby of the family]], Stan and Francine's high-school aged son. He attends [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Pearl Bailey High School]]. Steve is portrayed as an enthusiastic, ambitious, and wimpy [[nerd]].<ref name="imemine1" /> In the official series, he is not presented as nerdy as he is in the show's [[American Dad!#Adjustments in on-air presentation, production and broadcasts|unaired precursory pilot]] when his appearance, voice and manner greatly contrasted from what they would eventually become. In the precursory pilot, Steve was also gawkier, scrawnier and voiced by [[Ricky Blitt]] (as opposed to [[Scott Grimes]]). In the official series, he's become emphasized as soft, emotional, cute and endearing. As part of his emotional and sensitive character, Steve is combined with a screechy wail. Despite his wimpy and nerdy characteristics, Steve is particularly conceited and obnoxious. He is all too often a showman, always ready to put on a performance and show off his "talents", typically singing/dance wise.<ref name="autogenerated5">{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/americandad/about/ |title=FOX Broadcasting Company - American Dad TV Show - American Dad TV Series - American Dad Episode Guide |publisher=Fox.com |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name="google1">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&pg=PT220&dq=American+Dad!+series |title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 Through 2010 - Vincent Terrace - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01|isbn=9780786486410|year=2011}}</ref> Steve is usually accompanied by his equally uncool friends: "[[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Snot]]", Steve's closest friend with whom he shares a [[bromance]],<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/why-cant-we-be-friends,89173/ |title="Why Can't We Be Friends?" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

(season 7)|License to Till]]"); [[Toshi (American Dad)|Toshi]], who is an [[Asian American]] and only speaks [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; and [[Barry (American Dad!)|Barry]], who is [[obesity|morbidly obese]] with an inarticulate, strident, and sloppy [[human voice|vocal quality]]. Steve possesses a keen interest in the opposite sex and has had an obese girlfriend, Debbie, to which Stan disapproved. Steve's relationship with his father is strained with Stan often behaving judgmentally and intolerantly over Steve's nerdiness, immaturity and sensitivity. Steve has been known to cop attitude, sometimes rightfully so at Stan over his offensive acts.

* [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]] is the Smith family's very zany [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]. Blithely so, he is depraved, devious, and cruel. Roger typically displays a lighthearted, carefree temperament while at the same time engaging in his freakish grossness, outrageous malice, and rascally shenanigans.<ref name="avclub4" /><ref name="ovguide1" /><ref name="avclub3">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/naked-to-the-limit-one-more-time,92287/ |title="Naked To The Limit, One More Time" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref> Roger was tricked into coming to [[Earth]] in 1947, led to believe he was "The Decider" in whose hands the fate of mankind rested. In the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]" however, it is evidenced that Roger remains on Earth by will, the episode revealing that he can simply call for his aliens' spaceship to return him to his birth planet if he so desires. Details on Roger's actual family and pre-Earth life have yet to be shown on the series. Although in the episode "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]", a brief clip revealed that prior to Roger's life on Earth, he was involved in a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] romantic relationship with another member of his alien race, Zing; however, Roger [[adultery|cheated]] on Zing, blatantly making out with a human male in front of him. It's also been revealed that Roger has lived on Earth for many years prior to his life spent with the Smith family. Roger came into contact with the Smith family when he saved Stan's life back when Roger was a fugitive of [[Area 51]] (four years prior to the show's beginnings). Feeling he owed Roger a life debt because of this, Stan rescued him from government capture and allowed him to live in his home. Stan has allowed this in defiance of his employer, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Roger now covertly lives in the Smith home. The Smiths use their attic as a hideout/bedroom for Roger. Stan feels that it would endanger him and the rest of his family if it were to be discovered that Roger is an alien and living with them; however, Roger is able to skillfully use disguises to exist in the outside world. Adding to this, he's created countless [[alter ego]]s to go along with them.<ref name="avclub3" /> Roger has, however, abused this practice, leading numerous lives and outrageously deceiving numerous people. In fact, some of Roger's characters are in [[prison]], while others are widely despised, and others somehow have full-fledged human families, etc. Roger's vocal delivery is based on that of late comedian [[Paul Lynde]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycYlI3-7DU|title=American Dad! - Seth on Paul Lynde and Patrick Stewart|work=YouTube|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

*[[Klaus Heissler]] is the family's attention-starved, hapless, [[wikt:saturnine|saturnine]] pet [[goldfish]].<ref name="autogenerated5" /> He is consultative and full of sage advice, sometimes even taking on a scholarly appearance and wearing reading glasses.<ref name="autogenerated5"/> Klaus is actually a man in a fish body. He was once an [[East German]] [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Ski jumping|ski-jumper]] until his brain and presumably vocal cords were transferred into the body of a goldfish. The CIA did this to Klaus at the 1986 [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] to prevent him from winning the gold medal. This has resulted in Klaus becoming permanently trapped in the body of a goldfish, leaving him at times discontented and gloomy. Not confined to his fishbowl, he is often seen scooting himself about the Smith residence, reclined in a glass of water. In these moments, it is only his very lower back that is actually in the water. In the early part of the series, Klaus had an obsessive crush on Francine and often made sexual advances towards her.<ref name="awn.com"/> The Smith family and particularly Roger have been shown to treat Klaus with disdain. Ironically, Klaus started out in the series as a bully, known for his ridicule and cruel teasing of all the show's main characters, particularly Roger. As Roger took on more cruel and brazen behaviors, however, this became lessened.

[[File:Jeff Fischer (American Dad!).png|120px|right|thumb|Jeff Fischer, Hayley's on and off boyfriend, who married her in "100 AD".]]

* [[Jeff Fischer (American Dad!)|Jeff Fischer]] is Hayley's mellow, stoner, [[hippie]] boyfriend and later whipped husband. An unemployed high school dropout with no apparent skills, he is emasculated, weak-willed, pathetic and frequently behaves naively. Jeff is often shown to be infatuated with Hayley's mother, Francine, having made subtle passes at her on many occasions. Jeff's own mother abandoned him early on, giving birth to him in a van, within which he lives until moving in with the Smiths. His relationship with his father, Henry, is abysmal, with Henry viewing and treating Jeff as a failure. Before moving in with the Smiths, Jeff lived from his van, which he had parked in front of the Smiths' residence when he started dating Hayley. In the episode "[[American Dad! (season 3)|Joint Custody]]" however, Jeff moves in with the Smiths as a result of Stan having a [[demolition]] crew crush his van into smithereens with a [[wrecking ball]]. Stan effected this in an effort to get Jeff away from his [Stan] property. Throughout the series, Hayley repeatedly dumps Jeff for being a needy, clingy pushover, leaving Jeff crushed until their inevitable reconciliations. In the show's [[100 A.D. (American Dad!)|one-hundredth episode]], the two finally marry. In the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]", Jeff learns that Roger is an alien. Because of this, Stan informs that he must kill either Roger or Jeff to protect his family. Roger, however, informs that he will call his fellow aliens to take him back to his birth planet; however, Roger surprise chucks Jeff into the spaceship while he stays behind on Earth. In the [[American Dad! (season 9)|Season 9 episode]] "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]", Jeff escapes from an alien spaceship and starts to make his way back to Earth. In a [[American Dad! (season 10)|Season 10]] episode "Longest Distance Relationship," Jeff is able to communicate with Hayley though a CB radio and discovers a way to return to earth through a wormhole. Jeff and Sinbad's Ghost arrive 60 years in the future and learns that he cost her a chance to have a great life with Millionaire Matt Davis. Unhappy with having upset the family and giving the elderly Hayley a heart attack, he and Sinbad's Ghost return through the wormhole. Jeff tells the again-young Hayley to move on with her life as he Sadly gives up on her unaware that Matt is killed by Roger very shortly after.

The Smith family and their three housemates reside on 43 Cherry Street in the fictional [[suburb]] of Langley Falls, Virginia.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/american-dad-gets-another-22-episodes-412027.html?cat=2 |title=American Dad Gets Another 22 Episodes - Yahoo!

The Smiths and their three housemates live in a large, two-story residence with a basement and an attic. In addition, the Smith house is apparently enhanced with numerous secret rooms, facilities, and large [[habitat]]s, these unorthodox attachments usually only seen once for each (i.e., the episodes "[[American Dad! (season 3)|Of Ice and Men]]", "Bush Comes to Dinner", "[[American Dad (season 9)|The Missing Kink]]", "[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith]]", etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americandadscripts.com/S02E07_Of-Ice-and-Men.php |title=American Dad Scripts |publisher=American Dad Scripts |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> The house is also shown to be filled with many [[trapping pit|pitfall traps]], one of which is filled with [[alligator]]s and another named by Stan as the "Pit of No Return."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ourmmq5fThMJ:tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NoodleIncident/WesternAnimation+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |title=Western Animation - Television Tropes & Idioms |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/american-dad/bush-comes-to-dinner-888107/ |title=American Dad! - Season 3, Episode 10: Bush Comes to Dinner |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> [[Greg Corbin|Greg and Terry]] are a [[Same-sex relationship|gay couple]] that live across the street from the Smiths. Within the neighborhood, they are portrayed as running a neater and tidier home than the Smiths. Greg and Terry are also the [[local news]] [[news presenter|anchor]] for W-ANG-TV. Also in the area is the high school attended by Steve, [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Pearl Bailey High School]].<ref name="google1" />

==Production==
When asked what first spurred the idea for ''American Dad!'' [[Seth MacFarlane]] answered, "It was right after the [[United States presidential election, 2000|[2000] election]], and me and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] that we would just spend days bitching and complaining, and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable."<ref name="doorly1" /><ref name="autogenerated8" /> In early February 2005, Barker stated, "About a year and a half ago, Seth called and asked if Matt and I would be interested in working on a show about a right-wing CIA agent and his liberal daughter. It was right up our alley, and everything just fell into place."<ref name="autogenerated3" /><ref name="autogenerated8"/> On September 14, 2003, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Fox Broadcasting had ordered a [[American Dad!#The unaired precursory pilot|pilot presentation]] of the then tentatively titled ''American Dad!'' and "If greenlit, ''American Dad!'' could launch as early as fall 2004." At the time, Fox was aiming to develop a new lineup of adult animated sitcoms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dore |first=Shalini |url=http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/fox-hankering-for-a-homer-with-dad-1117892445/ |title=Fox hankering for a homer with 'Dad' |publisher=Variety |date=2003-09-14 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>
[[File:Mike Barker by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|160px|left|thumb|[[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]]: co-creator and co-showrunner from seasons 1 through 10]]
''American Dad!'' had a [[Mid-season replacement|mid-season]] debut. Its first episode, titled "[[Pilot (American Dad!)|Pilot]]", was originally shown directly following [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] on February 6, 2005. The rest of the [[American Dad! (season 1)|first season]], however, would not launch until May 1, 2005, on Fox's Animation Domination lineup which had its debut on that date.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="avclub7" /><ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Goodman|title=''American Dad'' is a wannabe|date=2005-02-04|publisher=Hearst Newspapers|url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/04/DDGIFB4H5E1.DTL|work =San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate = 2007-12-22}}</ref> Initially, it was a replacement for the originally failed series ''[[Family Guy]]'' (1999–2002). ''American Dad!'' was originally intended to be [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s answer to the hordes of fans left behind from the original failure of MacFarlane's previous [[animation|animated]] venture.<ref name="autogenerated2006" /> Just three short months after ''American Dad!''{{'}}s debut however, ''Family Guy'' was revived, leaving ''American Dad!'' with a formidable expectation: whether the series could distinguish itself from its counterpart and succeed on its own merits.<ref name="autogenerated2006" /> Instead of taking over [[creative director|creative direction]] of the series, MacFarlane left the job largely in the hands of Barker and Weitzman so as to distinguish ''American Dad!''<ref name="doorly1" />

In its early going, ''American Dad!'' brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike.<ref name="autogenerated8"/> The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with ''Family Guy'' have led to foregone conclusions and [[prejudice]]s against ''American Dad!'' as a [[ripoff#Overview|rip-off]] of the predecessor.<ref name="autogenerated8"/> Many of these prejudgments have even predated ''American Dad!'' Critics had already written off ''American Dad!'' prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of ''Family Guy'' and MacFarlane's attempts to get his old show back on the air.<ref name="avclub7" /> One example, prior to the ''American Dad!'' series debut, a writer of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a piece that reads "But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing ''American Dad!'' The new series officially premieres in May but has a sneak preview tomorrow night in the coveted post-Super Bowl time period&nbsp;... The look and pace of ''American Dad!'' is the same as ''Family Guy''."<ref name="washingtonpost2">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18-2005Feb4.html |title='American Dad': Dysfunctional Comedy |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2005-02-05 |accessdate=2013-05-15 |first=John |last=Maynard}}</ref> [[File:Matt Weitzman by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Co-creator and sole showrunner [[Matt Weitzman]]]]

In actuality, however, the program's beginnings take cues from the TV series ''[[All in the Family]],'' almost a farcical animated version of the [[live action]] sitcom.<ref name="autogenerated4" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref> Both shows make use of political satire, [[bigotry]], ludicrous expressions of Conservatism from their paternal main character (Stan likened to [[Archie Bunker]]), and sensible expressions of Liberalism from their daughter character (Hayley likened to [[Gloria Stivic]]). Moreover, the daughter in both series each have a Liberal hippie boyfriend turned husband (Jeff likened to [[Michael Stivic]]) of whom the daughter's Conservative father is antagonistic towards (Stan likened to Archie). Also in both, the daughter lives in her parents' home with her boyfriend turned husband as a housemate. ''American Dad!'' in its original form was even said to have been inspired by ''All in the Family''.<ref name="autogenerated4" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/showrunners-2012-seth-macfarlane-family-guy%3Damerican-dad-cleveland-show-375974 |title=Showrunners 2012: 'American Dad's' Seth MacFarlane & Matt Weitzman, 'Family Guy's' Mark Hentemann & Steve Callaghan, 'Cleveland Show's' Rich Appel |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |first=Lacey |last=Rose}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> In ''American Dad!''{{'}}s initial seasons, however, MacFarlane was described as focusing more attention on his coexisting obligation of ''Family Guy.'' This was to the extent that ''American Dad!'' was completely secondary to him, and he did not understand the show. Because he was not getting the show at the time, he was described as "just going along for the ride." Likewise, the rest of the show's creators Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were also trying to figure out the show and where it was going.<ref name="avclub7" /><ref name="autogenerated8"/> [[File:Seth MacFarlane at Fox Fall Eco-Casino Party - 8 September 2008 crop.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Co-creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]]]

After ''American Dad!''{{'}}s initial couple of seasons and as it progressed, the show began to increasingly develop its very own distinct approach and identity, becoming more and more distinguished from all other programs on the air. Standing out from its counterparts increasingly with each passing season, the series has been described as eventually becoming the weirdest show in network [[prime time]]. It has been characterized as serving up distinguishing blasts of surrealism.<ref name="avclub7" /> As the series progressed, MacFarlane realized that Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were on to something uniquely appealing; moreover, he realized they were on to something that sharply contrasted from ''Family Guy'', which audiences appreciated.<ref name="avclub7" /><ref name="autogenerated8"/>

After the show's first several seasons, MacFarlane not only came to fully understand and appreciate ''American Dad!''{{'}}s value but also came to consider himself a huge fan of the series. Taking note of his [[Twitter]] followers increased [[fanaticism]] and excitement over ''American Dad!'' and the "Roger" character, MacFarlane began putting considerable amounts of his time and efforts into the series, more so in the last several seasons than ever before (this observation made in fall 2012).<ref name="avclub7" /> In describing ''American Dad!'' comedy styles, Barker noted that it is not as reference-laden as ''Family Guy'' or ''[[South Park]]''. He added that ''American Dad!''{{'}}s humor more frequently derives from "the human condition and emotions that everyone can relate to: ego, the feds, etc. And for that reason, I think our humor is a little more [[evergreen#Metaphorical use|evergreen]]."<ref>{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad/lists |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref>

===Developing plot lines and scripts===
On developing [[screenplay]]s for ''American Dad!'' episodes, co-creator Mike Barker revealed that he and the rest of the show's staff never know when and from where plot line ideas will emerge. "Just as an example," Barker explained, "[[American Dad! (season 2)|All About Steve]]" is an episode where Stan wants his son to be more of a jock and more like he was when he was his age. That whole episode came about from one of our writers Dave Hemingson coming into our office, telling us he just visited the dentist and he may need to get braces. And the idea of a grown man with braces appealed to us, and we just decided what if we put Stan in braces, and he understands for the first time what it's like to feel like a geek."<ref name="movieweb1">{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

During the [[American Dad! (season 9)|2012–13 season]], Barker revealed that much of his [[wikt: inspiration|inspiration]] for ''American Dad!'' plots has come through listening to music. Barker's revelation to use music as a muse for his ''American Dad!'' writing came from attending the 2008 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival]]. During that event, he watched the [[rock band]] [[My Morning Jacket]] perform a four-hour set in the rain and realized from the experience that he could generate ideas for ''American Dad!'' by tapping into music: "From that point on, I realized that music should be playing a bigger role in my writing", Barker told the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]''. "Writing is hard for me, and when you hear music that inspires good ideas, you're really grateful."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/the-new-now/150th-episode-american-dad-inspired-indie-rockers-wax-163730696.html |title=150th Episode of 'American Dad' Inspired by Indie Rockers Wax Fang &#124; The New Now (NEW) - Yahoo! Music |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref>

In particular, Barker has credited music from [[Wax Fang]] for his inspiration in writing certain ''American Dad!'' plots. Said Barker, "There's just something so inherently [[filmmaking|cinematic]] about Wax Fang's music. [Scott] Carney's voice is stunningly clear and dramatic. And his lyrics are specific enough to build stories around while staying flexible enough for different [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]s." Barker added that through listening to the Wax Fang track ''Majestic'', he was able to come up with major plot elements for the episode "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]" (this episode features the Wax Fang songs ''Majestic'' and ''At Sea'').<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/05/01/american-dad-wax-fang/2126243/ |title=Exclusive: Rockers Wax Fang inspire 'American Dad' |work=USA Today |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref>

Barker has stated that once he and the rest of the show's staff get the idea for the [[plot (narrative)|plot line]], they spend a couple of weeks in a room with all the [[screenwriter]]s. There, they break the story and make sure that each act of the two [[act structure|act break]]s are strong. As another procedure, Barker stated that they make a point of twisting the story in such a way so as to make audiences come back for more after the commercial break.<ref name="movieweb1" />

"The final process," Barker explained, "is sending a screenwriter out to write the script. The screenwriter gets two weeks to write the script. The script then comes back." Barker explained that they then all edit and rewrite it, "hopefully keeping as much of the first draft as we can and punching the jokes and making sure all the motivations are there, and then we take it to the table and read it."<ref name="movieweb1" />

In February 2005, Barker stated that as creative directors, all decisions made about the plot line and direction of the series go through himself and Weitzman. He explained that the show had reflected their point of view since the beginning. Barker has also credited the program's other staff beyond himself, Weitzman, and MacFarlane, remarking "We couldn't have made it all happen without them." At the time, it was noted that the series had a staff of 17 writers, which was described as "a big undertaking."<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown/page/2%2C1 |title=American Dad Touchdown &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date=2005-02-04 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>

When Barker was asked what his favorite part was of the ''American Dad!'' pre-production process, he answered, "I like the story breaking process, personally—coming up with the stories. To me, that's the most gratifying."<ref name="movieweb1" />

Barker and Matt Weitzman have stated that they are accustomed to feeling scruples with adding certain material into the plots, but always follow this up by going ahead with incorporating the material anyway. They added that their goal is to create laughs combined with groans and going over the line.<ref name="youtube1" />

===Animated scenes===
MacFarlane played a lead role in the animated character designs for ''American Dad!''.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

In describing the characters' appearances, Weitzman remarked "It's all very bright, very easy on the eyes."<ref name="autogenerated3" />

In explaining the animated side of the job, Barker stated, "Fifty or so animators from the Fox animation group are involved. A lot is done in-house: poses, models, props, all storyboards and timing."<ref name="autogenerated4" />

Also as reported in February 2005, animation for ''American Dad!'' is colored and detailed overseas. [[Sunwoo Entertainment]] of Korea was said to handle that end of the pre-production process.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

===Editing, completion, and deadlines===
Barker has explained that because ''American Dad!'' creators are working in [[animation]] as opposed to [[live action]], they have the ability to redraw and rewrite up until the show is aired. This is as opposed to live action where individuals must shoot the show and work with whatever has been put together in the editing room long beforehand. In live action, studio production crew, equipment, sets and actors/actresses cannot be reassembled with new lines and procedures to memorize mere moments before airtime.

However, Barker has also stated, "It's really hard to accept anything less than perfect when you start to get wrapped up in this process of being able to constantly make changes. Eventually you have to kind of bring down the hammer at the color stage and live with what you've got."

Barker has explained that, ultimately, the creation process of an ''American Dad!'' episode is completed upon the producers' say-so, not anyone else's.<ref name="movieweb1" />

When ''American Dad!'' co-creator Matt Weitzman was asked what his favorite part was of the show's pre-production process, he answered, "I probably enjoy the [[film editing|editing]] process a lot. I think I like the fine tuning of things and making things happen just so. Making the episode just kind of pop in its own subtle ways."<ref name="movieweb1" />

''American Dad!'' creators have revealed to working significantly in advance of newly broadcast episodes. As many as 20 to 42 unaired episodes are typically ready for finishing touches. Barker explained that a key to this system is making sure that the writing is timeless, as opposed to topical and contemporary. He added that if any material within the script deals with contemporary issues, the creators have to hope that they're also contemporary issues two years down the line. When asked whether or not this method has ever brought on difficulties, Barker answered in the affirmative and explained:

::[[Harriet Miers]] was, like, the [[White House Press Secretary]], I think, and we had a joke about her. (Miers was a former [[White House Counsel]], who was briefly nominated for the [[Supreme Court]] by President [[George W. Bush]].) And I remember watching on air and having to [[Google]] who our own joke was, because it had been so long since the joke was pitched. But in terms of stories, we're less likely to be burned by a current-event issue no longer being current.<ref name="avclub7" />

In discussing the creation of ''American Dad!'' and animated sitcoms in general, MacFarlane has stated:

::It's an enormous amount of work. What goes into putting together an animated show, it's just staggering&nbsp;... I always knew there was a lot of work that went into making an animated show. Doing a traditional [[sitcom]], process-wise it feels like a breeze compared to doing an animated show. You can get it all done in a couple of months as opposed to a year. Doing an animated show, it's like putting together a little [[film|movie]] every week. Everything is [[storyboard]]ed with the intricacy of a [[feature film]] action sequence. You have to edit with a [[sheet music|musical score]] in mind. And of course, we use an [[orchestra]] for each episode. So it's really like putting together a little feature each week and I was just shocked at how much—not to underplay all the work that goes into live-action sitcoms—but my God, it's definitely a much more difficult medium to me.<ref name="doorly1" />

Conversely, Barker has stated:

::Working on animated shows like ''American Dad!'' is such a breath of fresh air. You don't have to worry about sets and such that you have to worry about for live-action. Animation can give you more freedom.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

===Voice cast===
{{See also|List of guest stars on American Dad!}}
The [[voice acting|voice actor]]s are not assembled as a group when performing the lines of their characters; rather, each of the voice actors perform their lines privately. The voice actors have stated that because of their personalities and tendency to goof off when together as a group, they would never get anything completed if they performed their lines collectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycYlI3-7DU |title=American Dad! - Seth on Paul Lynde and Sir Patrick Stewart |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-05-29}}</ref>

==Plot techniques==

===Farces===
''American Dad!'' has commonly made use of [[farce]]s as most of the predicaments that befall the main characters have escalated into the extremes, to the point of getting outrageously out-of-hand.<ref name="avclub4" /><ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qek-AlLBuEoJ:www.avclub.com/articles/finger-lenting-good,90011/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |title="Finger Lenting Good" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV &#124; The A.V.

It gets to the point where they divide the house in two, each decorating their half of the house in their desired fashion. Not satisfied with this however, they both attempted to drive the other out of the home and eventually erected a colossal block wall, dividing the two halves of the house. The rest of the family members were forced to spend one holiday after the next alternating between Fran's and Stan's place (the sides of the house treated as distinct homes). As another example, in the episode "[[Stan's Food Restaurant]]", Stan asks for Roger's help in starting a restaurant. As things progress, Roger makes heavy changes in the layout, eventually kicking Stan out of the project. Stan retaliates by opening another restaurant next door, which becomes a smashing success. Roger responds by blowing up Stan's restaurant but destroying his own in the process. Stan threatens to kill Roger, but backs down after Roger pulls a [[gun]] on him and tells him to relax.<ref name="collegehumor1" />

===Surreal humor===
''American Dad!'' [[plot (narrative)|plot]]s are generally teeming with [[surreal humor|surrealism]] and [[nonsense|nonsensical element]]s.<ref name="avclub5" /> Many of the occurrences, circumstances, and behaviors are unrestrainedly preposterous, senseless, and illogical.<ref name="avclub4" /><ref name="putlockertvshows1">{{cite web|url=http://putlockertvshows.com/watch/american-dad/ |title=Watch AMERICAN DAD! Full Episodes Streaming Online For Free _ PUTLOCKERTVSHOWS |publisher=Putlockertvshows.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref>

As further examples of surrealism on ''American Dad!''—in the episode "[[Hurricane! (American Dad!)|Hurricane!]]", a ferocious bear pauses in his attack, lowers his eyelids halfway, and repeatedly shakes his head horizontally, shaming Stan for missing him in a [[harpoon]] shot and instead spearing Francine into a wall; in the episode "[[List of American Dad! episodes#Season 9: 2012–13|Why Can't We Be Friends?]]", the hallways of the Smith house transform into dark and dangerous [[ghetto]] [[alley]]ways for every time Roger [[ambush]]ed, stole money from, and even tried to forcibly rape Jeff Fischer;<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/why-cant-we-be-friends,89173/ |title="Why Can't We Be Friends?" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Missing Kink]]", Steve and family fish Klaus are shown competing in a one-on-one [[basketball]] game between each other, the score nearly tied at 11 to 10; also in the "Missing Kink" episode, the Smith house is shown to consist of a never-before-seen underworld to which various friends and acquaintances of the Smiths party and frolic; in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith]]", Stan has a never-before-seen secret [[control room]] hidden underground just beside the house. The control room door's exterior side is camouflaged with the grass surrounding it. The room is filled with highly advanced, [[state of the art|state-of-the-art]] equipment. Access to the control room is achieved through a handprint reading device that extends from the ground when Stan extends his arm/hand at it; etc.<ref name="avclub5" /><ref name="putlockertvshows1" />

====Non sequitur====
Among one of the many forms of surreal humor and nonsense elements that have been used by ''American Dad!'' is the [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]. This arises when the show's focus becomes sidetracked by entirely unknown and unrelated characters in circumstances that are irrelevant to the episode's main plot. Typically when this happens, it is after the show has maintained focus on its main characters for much of the episode; following this, the scenes randomly lose focus and become deeply wrapped up into the lives of never-before-seen characters who are non-central to the plot. A prime example of this is in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 1)|Homeland Insecurity]]". As opposed to scenes focusing on main characters, attention is redirected deep into the lives of unknown characters who gain possession of Roger's transforming [[feces]] turned [[gold]]. As another example, in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Missing Kink]]", the show's focus is sporadically sidetracked with brief scenes revolving around the life of a [[drug abuse|drug abusing]] bird and Francine's inexplicable ability to both understand and communicate with the bird's chirping.<ref name="avclub5" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lynnpatt.com/watch-american-dad-the-wrestler-season-7-episode-12.html |title=Watch American Dad! – The Wrestler Season 7 Episode 12 - Online Business Blog &#124; Online Business Blog |publisher=Lynnpatt.com |date=2012-03-08 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref>

===Plot twists and unexpected elements===
The series has abounded with random, unexpected occurrences and surprise [[plot twist]]s as result of the characters and the very makeup of the program.<ref name="avclub6">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-full-cognitive-redaction-of-avery-bullock-by-t,96582/ |title="The Full Cognitive Redaction Of Avery Bullock By The Coward Stan Smith" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> For example, in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith]]", Steve refers to Roger for help in dealing with a school bully. Because Steve is able to correctly predict Roger's original game plan of handling the situation himself under an alter ego, Roger [[wikt: throw somebody a curve|throws him a curveball]]: he not only hires someone else, Stelio Kontos (from the episode "[[Bully for Steve]]"), to handle the matter but hires him to bully Steve in combination with Steve's original bully. As another example, in the episode "[[The Vacation Goo]]", Francine becomes frustrated that she cannot get the family together for Sunday night dinner. For family time, Stan suggests a vacation, and the Smiths have a great time in [[Maui]] as a family. This is up until Roger shuts down the mechanism Francine and the kids are all attached to so as to believe they are all on vacation. Francine and the kids then learn that Stan has been programming a pseudo-vacation every year in a contraption dubbed "the goo chambers". After learning of this, Francine demands they go on a real vacation. Twice they appear to do so, first [[skiing]], then to [[Italy]], until it is ultimately revealed that they are in the "goo chambers" all along, with Steve and then Hayley having programmed the vacations, respectively. In the episode "[[Spelling Bee My Baby]]", Steve deliberately misspells his words in a [[spelling bee]] so as to express his love for [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Akiko]] (who is also competing), instead spelling random [[Tyler Perry]]/[[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]] films.<ref name="avclub6" />

===Story arc use===
Another plot technique used by ''American Dad!'' is the [[story arc]]. On several occasions, a circumstance expands and progresses across a collection of episodes.<ref name="avclub4" /><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/spelling-bee-my-baby,93604/ |title="Spelling Bee My Baby" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref> As an example, one of Hayley's temporary breakups with Jeff expanded across a string of episodes, in which she instead temporarily dated a black man in a [[koala bear]] body, [[Reginald the Koala|Reginald Koala]]—known for his very [[urban culture|urban]] mannerisms and behaviors. As another example, since the [[American Dad! (season 9)|9th season]] episode "[[List of American Dad! episodes#Season 9: 2012–13|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]", Jeff Fischer has been absent from the Smith house and planet Earth altogether. In that episode, Jeff is [[wikt: blindside|blindsided]] when Roger hurls him into a spaceship. This spacecraft belongs to Roger's race of aliens and was intended to return him back to his birth planet; however, Roger remains behind after casting Jeff into the spaceship. The spaceship immediately takes off and Jeff is not seen until several episodes later, the episode "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]". During episodes that aired between the two aforementioned episodes, allusions to the ongoing plot line are made. For example, in the episode "[[List of American Dad! episodes#Season 9: 2012–13|Spelling Bee My Baby]]", Hayley is shown holding out hope for Jeff's return. In the episode, Roger and Stan attempt to rush Hayley through her [[grieving process]] so she will be willing to be their [[Official (tennis)|tennis official]].<ref name="avclub4" /><ref name="avclub1" /> As of the completion of the show's 10th season (2013–14), Jeff has yet to return to [[Earth]].

In discussing the cartoon's distinguishing story arc element, co-creator Mike Barker explained:

::We just try to obey basic rules of continuity. We try to avoid stories where a character is taking a big step like marriage and then not going back to it. I think by doing that, then in the future when we have big changes, the audience knows that they're going to be living with those changes for a while. So it's not just a thrown-away bit. It kind of endows that story beat with more power because it's going to last. It's not just going to be a [[Reset button technique|reset button]].<ref name="avclub7" />

===Gallows humor===
Much of the wit used in ''American Dad!'' has come in the form of [[gallows humor]] as many of the predicaments and circumstances have made fun of the characters in life-threatening, disastrous, terrifying, and traumatic situations.<ref name="avclub2">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/why-cant-we-be-friends,89173/ |title="Why Can't We Be Friends?" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref> As an example, the episode "[[A Ward Show]]" is chock full of [[suicide]] and [[murder]]: Roger became Steve's [[legal guardian]] and responded to him getting picked on at school by rigging the teachers' cars with [[explosive material|explosives]] and killing them all. Later on in the episode while [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Principal Lewis]] was driving his vehicle with Steve as the passenger, he informed Steve that he was about to drive off the [[Grand Canyon]] in a [[murder-suicide]]. This culminated in Roger saving the day, his love supernaturally allowing the car to fly once Principal Lewis drove off the Canyon; however, another vehicle with a random white man and a black boy in it (opposite of Principal Lewis, a black man and Steve, a white boy) had also, coincidentally enough, driven off the opposite side of the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide attempt. This resulted in a [[mid-air collision|midair collision]] between the car with Principal Lewis and Steve in it and the car with the white man and black boy in it.<ref name="avclub2" /> Another example, in the episode "[[Da Flippity Flop]]", Roger leaves a long series of [[harassment|harassing]] [[answering machine]] messages for Steve, trying to get him to sign up for his gym. In these messages, Roger is also heard snapping on various people, killing three individuals from [[reckless driving]], landing himself in [[court]], and subsequently becoming irate and shooting up numerous people at the city courthouse for being scolded to turn off his [[mobile phone]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/da-flippity-flop,97154/ |title="Da Flippity Flop" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref>

===Cringe comedy and shock value===
Much of the comedy on the show has come in the form of [[cringe comedy]] and [[shock value]] as circumstances and behaviors on the series have been presented with humor intended to elicit sharp disgust, discomfort or shock. The show's creators have stated that if material attracts laughter combined with groans and offense, it is a shoo-in for ''American Dad!''<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AHzYxnmAA8 |title='American Dad' Producers Talk Season Premiere |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}</ref> As an example, in the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Can I Be Frank with You]]", during a massage treatment in which Roger had a nurse reaching her arms/hands up his [[anus|anal]]/[[colon (anatomy)|colon]] region to squirt water inside of him, it was revealed that Roger knowingly had a live house cat residing up his anus and colon regions. Roger chided the cat for coming out during the massage.<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/can-i-be-frank-with-you,88303/ |title="Can I Be Frank With You?" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref> Another example, in the episode "[[The Scarlett Getter]]", Steve magically started having good luck whenever wearing his sister Hayley's [[panties]].

Some examples of these humor forms have hinted at [[incest]]. On more than one occasion, Stan has flexed and showed off his derrière at his own children, Steve and Hayley, once even making attempts to get them to grab onto it. In the episode "[[Great Space Roaster]]", Stan remarked, "Steve, don't steal glances. If you want to check out my meatballs in this thing, go right ahead. I'm your dad." In the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Why Can't We Be Friends?]]" as Steve turned around and walked away from an upset Stan who had just finished scolding him, Stan quietly admired his son's derrière, remarking to himself, "Kid's got his mother's ass, lucky bastard." Further, in the episode "[[Pulling Double Booty]]", Hayley was seen making out with a man that was identical to her father. Mistaking him for Stan, Francine disgustedly passed out. Stan later revealed the look-alike to be a body double of his, named Bill, who worked for the CIA. Hayley was convinced that Bill was the one and if he dumped her, she would go "maximum insane": She would kill Bill, burn down the neighborhood, and rape Roger according to her. While the four spent time together at the beach, Stan gave Bill a detailed account of Francine's [[libido|sex drive]], leading Bill to [[seduction|seduce]] and attempt to have [[sexual intercourse]] with Francine. Stan later kicked Bill out of his house. He then passed himself off as Bill to Hayley. With Hayley under the impression that Stan was Bill, the two traveled to a romantic resort, with Hayley all the while attempting strong sexual advances on her own father.

==Season number discrepancies and episode misreports==

===Season number discrepancies===

There are multiple conflicting reports and models as to the number of seasons ''American Dad!'' has had.<ref name="autogenerated8"/>

(A): One of the reports upholds a one-season-fewer numbering model: Under this arrangement, season 1 is a combination of both the first 7 episodes and the following 16 episodes, despite the separation of these two episode collections by a summer hiatus. Under this system, season 1 is uncharacteristically longer in contrast to the rest of the show's seasons, consisting of 23 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|last=McEwen |first=Lauren |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/american-dad-one-of-the-most-sophisticated-mainstream-shows-on-african-american-culture/2012/10/08/e8374cba-051d-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html |title='American Dad': One of the most sophisticated mainstream shows on African American culture - The Root DC Live |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/da-flippity-flop,97154/ |title="Da Flippity Flop" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref>

(B): The other report upholds a one-season-more numbering model: Under this arrangement, season 1 ended after the program's first 7 episodes leading into the summer hiatus. Season 2 then picked up when the following 16 episodes began that fall. Under this system, season 1 is uncharacteristically shorter in contrast to the rest of the show's seasons, consisting of only 7 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/american-dad!/season-9 |title=American Dad! - Season 9 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref>

Commentary from ''American Dad!'' co-creators Matt Weitzman and Mike Barker has largely been consistent with (A): on September 28, 2012, the two were interviewed and reported that they had 20 episodes completed for the then imminent "2012–13 eighth season," and were in the process of doing early work on the show's "2013–14 ninth season."<ref>{{cite web|author=Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012 |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/comedy-showrunners-week-american-dads-cocreators-o,85507/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: American Dad's co-creators on the show's weird evolution &#124; TV &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-09-28 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> During the show's life on Fox however, the network contradicted that arrangement as it presented information on the show's now former website in the form of (B): in listing all episodes from the 2012–13 season, Fox reported each as existing as part of the show's "ninth season."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/americandad/recaps/season-9/episode-19 |title=FOX Broadcasting Company - American Dad TV Show - American Dad TV Series - American Dad Episode Guide |publisher=Fox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> In addition, Fox contradicted its own ''American Dad!'' website, also supporting the one-season-fewer numbering scheme: Fox Flash, which is the publicity center for Fox, labeled the 2012–13 broadcasts as the "eighth season."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z28z5z5 |title=Foxflash - FOX Publicity Online - American Dad TV Show |publisher=Foxflash.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Websites releasing the show's season-based ratings [[American Dad!#Nielsen ratings by season|have also used the one-season-fewer numbering method]].

===Episode misreporting by Fox===
It is evident that Fox either miscounts ''American Dad!'' episodes or at least intentionally discounts one episode of the series. This was established in Fox [[advertisement]]s for the episode "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]." The episode was promoted by Fox as ''American Dad!''{{'}}s 150th episode. Subsequently, numerous [[mainstream media]] reports also labeled the episode as the 150th.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yahoo!

(season 9)|The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith]]" was the 150th episode of the series. In addition, Fox has misreported the "Lost in Space" episode as the revealing of Roger's birth planet. In actuality, the setting of this episode is a spaceship owned by members of Roger's alien race. To date, Roger's birth planet has yet to be revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/americandad/ |title=FOX Broadcasting Company - American Dad on FOX - Official Site |publisher=Fox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

==Adjustments in on-air presentation, production and broadcasts==

===The unaired precursory pilot===
While the series premiere of ''American Dad!'' is entitled "Pilot", "Pilot" is not the show's actual [[television pilot|pilot]] presentation. The actual pilot is a 6-minute version of the first 6 minutes in the series premiere. This precursory pilot was used by MacFarlane, Barker and Weitzman to sell ''American Dad!'' to Fox and was never aired along with the rest of the series. While much of the [[dialogue]] and general [[scenery]] was simply redone as between the precursory pilot and the following series premiere, there are sharp distinctions as between the two works. In the same manner, sharp distinctions also exist as between the precursory pilot and the official series as a whole. Most of these distinctions in question are in [[image|pictorial]] technique. For example, scenes from the pilot are all drawn in rougher, more cursory fashions with weaker coloration as compared to scenes from the official series. As a most prominent distinction, Steve's physical design and outfit in the predecessor greatly contrast from his official design and outfit. In addition, Steve is voiced by Ricky Blitt in the precursory pilot while voiced by Scott Grimes in the official series. There are also variations in Steve's persona as between the precursory pilot and the official series.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=L-VkAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Dad+unaired+pilot&q=American+Dad+unaired+pilot |title=Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television - Thomas Riggs - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= August 2007|accessdate=2013-09-17|isbn=9780787690502}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/american-dad/unaired-pilot-presentation-1125249/ |title=American Dad! - Season 1, Episode 0: Unaired Pilot Presentation |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>

===Characterization===
Early episodes of the series featured political banter between the conservative Stan and liberal Hayley. However, the creators learned quickly that political banter between Stan and Hayley had only "a limited shelf life." Creators described the approach as not providing them as much as they originally thought it would. Said co-creator Matt Weitzman, "There are times when we still have that kind of dynamic between them, but not nearly what it was in the first season. And I think the show, honestly, has grown and benefited from it, because that would have gotten boring after a while."<ref name="avclub7" />

Roger was enhanced by being provided with a [[running gag]] of alternate disguises and freedom to exist outside of the Smith house. The show's original concept basically portrayed him as being similar to [[A.L.F.|Alf]], having him sit in the house all day while commenting on life. The creators, however, have stated that the character was far too much fun to keep restricted to the house, and having him interact with different people provided for lots of material. The creators have further appreciated the direction of Roger for the fact that he almost serves as a different [[guest appearance|guest star]] for each episode what with [[Roger (American Dad!)#Disguises and alter egos|his many alter egos]]. The show's staff believe this element of the show highlights MacFarlane's versatility as he voices Roger and his countless alter egos.<ref name="avclub7" />

There have been three versions of the "Steve" character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve's initial design would end up being a one-off execution limited to the [[American Dad!#The unaired precursory pilot|unaired precursory pilot]] (not to be confused with the series premiere, entitled "Pilot"). By the season premiere, [[Scott Grimes]] had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time, he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating a sharper contrast to his father Stan's ruggedness and machismo.<ref>{{cite web|author=Animation |url=http://tv-facts.net/movie-review/american-dad/ |title=American Dad! |publisher=TV Facts |date=2013-03-23 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

Between the eighth and ninth seasons there were significant changes in the show's writing staff. Mike Barker mentions (with one-season-less numbering) "We lost some animators, and we lost a lot of writers. Season eight, our writing staff is about 65–70 percent new."<ref name="avclub7" />

===Network relocation from Fox to TBS===
On July 16, 2013, it was announced that ''American Dad!'' had quietly been cancelled by Fox. Shortly thereafter, however, the cable station [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] had picked up ''American Dad!'' for a 15-episode 11th season, slated to premiere on October 20, 2014.<ref name="zap2it2">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/14/tnt-tbs-announce-new-series-including-transporter-the-series-the-librarians-angie-tribeca-more/264223/ |title=TNT & TBS Announce New Series Including ‘Transporter: The Series’, ‘The Librarians’, ‘Angie Tribeca’ & More |publisher=TVbytheNumbers |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated6">{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2013/11/09/Seth-MacFarlanes-Bordertown-picked-up-by-Fox/UPI-96291384015624/?spt=rln&or=1 |title=Fox to air Seth MacFarlane's "Bordertown" animated series next year |publisher=UPI.com |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref> Currently, TBS airs reruns of ''American Dad!'' in syndication.<ref name="TBSrevival">{{cite news|last=Hinckley|first=David|title=Seth MacFarlane's 'American Dad' picked up by TBS|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/american-dad-picked-tbs-article-1.1400187|publisher=New York Daily News|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> The tenth season was initially to be the final season on Fox, however on July 20, 2014, it was announced that Fox had three unaired episodes left for broadcast. Two of the three aired back-to-back on September 14, 2014, and the final episode aired on September 21, 2014. Reports from Fox seemed to imply that these three episodes constituted a family of their own, season 10. Among [[American Dad! (season 11)#Network move and season number discrepancies|multiple discrepant reports from TBS]] however, one indicated that the three episodes are the beginning of the 11th season to resume on their network.<ref name="tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/07/20/fox-announces-guest-voices-for-the-simpsons-family-guy-bobs-burgers/284387/|title=FOX Announces Guest Voices for ‘The Simpsons’, ‘Family Guy’ & ‘Bob’s Burgers’ - Ratings - TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> TBS actually debuted their first episode through social media websites [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] on October 13, 2014.

On the show's network relocation, Mike Barker has stated, "It's going to be the same ''American Dad!'', just in a different place." Barker also joked that the network relocation was to execute a [[Tyler Perry]] crossover they [Barker and ''American Dad!'' production staff] had long aspired to.<ref name="zap2it1">{{cite web|author=' + data.results.personName + ' |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html |title=Comic-Con 2013: 'American Dad' Season 10 guest stars include Zooey Deschanel, Alison Brie and Mariah Carey - Zap2it |publisher=Blog.zap2it.com |date=2013-07-20 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref> In reality, the purpose of the network relocation is Fox's move away from the "Animation Domination" format to make room for sitcoms like ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''. It may also be due to the arrival of a new animated series from ''Family Guy'' writer Mark Hentemann and executive produced by ''American Dad!'' creator Seth MacFarlane called ''[[Bordertown (2014 TV series)|Bordertown]]''.

===Mike Barker's exit===
On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Mike Barker had departed ''American Dad!''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-dad-showrunner-mike-barker-652973 |title='American Dad' Co-Showrunner Mike Barker Exits Ahead of TBS Move |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref> Barker had served for ten seasons as the show's co-creator/executive and producer/co-[[showrunner]]. Matt Weitzman is now serving as the show's sole showrunner. The news came as early production for season 11 commenced. As of November 2013, the show's production crew is developing its first four episodes for season 11, slated to begin airing on October 20, 2014 when ''American Dad!'' moves to TBS.

==Reception==

===Series premiere===
Until [[American Dad! (season 11)|Season 11]] when "American Dad!" moved to TBS, all except for one episode of ''American Dad!'' originally aired on Animation Domination. The program's series premiere is the only episode that predates the Animation Domination lineup.

* The ''Volume One'' release was retitled ''Season One'' for the Region 2 and 4 releases, however the subsequent releases retained the ''Volume'' titles.
* On the packaging for the ''Season 1'' release on Region 2 DVD, there was no mention of audio commentaries or some of the bonus features, leading many to mistakenly believe they had been omitted from the release.
* The Region 2 and 4 DVDs do not have censored audio tracks on any episodes; however, ''Volume 3'' has so-called "uncensored tracks" on the set (probably an error from the transfer because the tracks are already automatically uncensored on the set).
* The Volume 4 DVD release blurb contained information on the episode "[[Phantom of the Telethon]]", which was instead featured on Volume 5.
* On Volume 6, despite claims of being uncensored, the bleeps from "[[American Dad! (season 6)|Home Adrone]]", "[[My Morning Straitjacket]]", and "[[G-String Circus]]" are not removed.
* Volume 9 features all episodes from Season 9, but features the poster from Season 10's "Poltergasm".

===Potential film adaptation===
At [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2013]] on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an ''American Dad!'' movie—centering on Roger and set on his birth planet—may take place in the future. Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show's creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a movie is where the show's staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an ''American Dad!'' movie may already even be in the works and partially written. No further information about the movie was released following Barker's exit from the series in November 2013.<ref name="zap2it1" />

===Crossovers with other animated sitcoms===
{{Main|Family Guy, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show crossovers}}

''American Dad!'' characters have appeared on other animated sitcoms and vice versa. To date, all of ''American Dad!''{{'}}s [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] have involved two other animated programs. The other two animated programs were also created by [[Seth MacFarlane]]: ''[[Family Guy]] ''(the crossover episode "[[Bigfat]]" also consisted of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' characters), and the cancelled series ''[[The Cleveland Show]].''

On December 8, 2013, [[Bart Simpson]] made a cameo appearance in the ''American Dad!'' season 10 episode, "Faking Bad". Though unofficial, this marked the first ever ''Simpsons/American Dad!'' crossover.<ref>{{cite news|author=12/09/2013 6:16 am EST |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/09/american-dad-bart-simpson-simpsons-breaking-bad-video_n_4411352.html |title=Bart Simpson Gets A Fake ID On An 'American Dad' That Channels 'Breaking Bad' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= December 9, 2013|accessdate=2013-12-29}}</ref>
