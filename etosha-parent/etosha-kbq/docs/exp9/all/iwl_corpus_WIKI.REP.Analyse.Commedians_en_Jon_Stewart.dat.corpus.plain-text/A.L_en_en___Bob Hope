'''Leslie Townes "Bob" Hope''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KC*SG]], [[Order of St. Sylvester|KSS]] (May 29, 1903 – July 27, 2003), was an English-born American [[stand up comedy|comedian]], [[vaudevillian]], [[actor]], [[singer]], [[dancer]], [[athlete]], and [[author]].<!-- Don't change occupations.--> With a career spanning nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in [[Bob Hope filmography|over 70 films and shorts]], including a series of "[[Road to …|Road]]" movies co-starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. In addition to hosting the [[Academy Award]]s fourteen times (more than any other host), he appeared in many stage productions and television roles and was the author of fourteen books. The song [[Thanks for the Memory|"Thanks For the Memory"]] is widely regarded as Hope's signature tune.

Celebrated for his long career performing [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) shows to entertain active service American military personnel—he made 57 tours for the USO between 1941 and 1991—Hope was declared an honorary veteran of the [[United States Armed Forces]] in 1997 by act of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].<ref name="Library of Congress" />

Hope participated in the sports of golf and boxing, and owned a small stake in his hometown baseball team, the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was married to performer [[Dolores Hope]] (née DeFina) for 69 years. Hope died at age 100 at his home in [[Toluca Lake]], California.

== Early years ==
[[File:HopewithGroupMeetsPattonWW2.jpg|thumb|left|Writer [[Hal Block]] (left) and Hope meet [[George Patton]] in Sicily during World War II]]
Hope was born in [[Eltham]], London, the fifth of seven sons. His [[English people|English]] father, William Henry Hope, was a [[stonemason]] from [[Weston-super-Mare]], Somerset, and his [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mother, Avis (Townes), was a [[operetta|light opera]] singer from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]{{fact|date=March 2015}} who later worked as a cleaner. They married in April 1891 and lived at 12 Greenwood Street, Barry, before moving to [[Whitehall, Bristol|Whitehall]] and then [[St George, Bristol]]. In 1908, the family emigrated to the United States aboard the [[SS Philadelphia (1888)|SS ''Philadelphia'']] and passed through [[Ellis Island]] on March 30, 1908, before moving to [[Cleveland, Ohio]].{{sfn|Moreno|2008|p=88}}

From age 12, Hope earned pocket money by [[busking]] (frequently on the streetcar to [[Luna Park, Cleveland|Luna Park]]), singing, dancing, and performing comedy.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=4}} He entered many dancing and amateur talent contests (as Lester Hope) and won a prize in 1915 for his impersonation of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name="loc.gov Early Life"/> For a time, he attended the Boys Industrial School in [[Lancaster, Ohio]]. As an adult, he donated sizable sums of money to the institution.<ref name="ohiohistorycentral"/>

Hope worked as a butcher's assistant and a [[Lineman (occupation)|lineman]] in his teens and early twenties. Deciding on a show business career, he and his girlfriend signed up for dance lessons. Encouraged after they performed in a three-day engagement at a club, Hope formed a partnership with Lloyd Durbin, a friend from the dance school.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=19–23}} Silent film comedian [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] saw them perform in 1925 and found them work with a touring troupe called Hurley's Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with George Byrne and the [[Hilton twins|Hilton Sisters]], conjoined twins who performed a tap dancing routine in the [[vaudeville]] circuit. Hope and Byrne had an act as a pair of Siamese twins as well, and danced and sang while wearing [[blackface]], before friends advised Hope that he was funnier as himself.{{sfn|Faith|2003|pp=402–403}}

In 1929, Hope informally changed his first name to "Bob". In one version of the story, he named himself after racecar driver [[Bob Burman]].{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=44}} In another, he said he chose the name because he wanted a name with a "friendly 'Hiya, fellas!' sound" to it.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=15–16}} In a 1942 legal document, Hope's legal name is given as Lester Townes Hope; it is unknown if this reflects a legal name change from Leslie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/uso.html|title=Bob Hope and American Variety: On the Road: USO Shows|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> After five years on the vaudeville circuit, Hope was "surprised and humbled" when he failed a 1930 screen test for the French film production company [[Pathé]] at [[Culver City, California]].{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=57–58}}

== Career ==
In the early days, Hope's career included appearances on stage in Vaudeville shows and Broadway productions. He began performing on the radio in 1934 and switched to television when that medium became popular in the 1950s. He began doing regular TV specials in 1954,{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=229}} and hosted the [[Academy Awards]] fourteen times in the period from 1941 to 1978.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=154}} Overlapping with this was his movie career, spanning the years 1934 to 1972, and his USO tours, which he did from 1941 to 1991.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=318–320}}{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=181–182}}

=== Film ===
{{main|Bob Hope filmography|Bob Hope short subjects}}

Hope signed a contract for six short films with [[Educational Pictures]] of New York. The first was a comedy, ''[[Going Spanish]]'' (1934). He was not happy with the film, and told [[Walter Winchell]], "When they catch [[John Dillinger]], they're going to make him sit through it twice."{{sfn|Maltin|1972|p=25}} Educational dropped his contract, but he soon signed with [[Warner Brothers]]. He made movies during the day and performed Broadway shows in the evenings.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=105, 107}}

[[File:Bob Hope in The Ghost Breakers trailer.JPG|thumb|left|Bob Hope in ''[[The Ghost Breakers]]'' trailer (1940)]]

Hope moved to Hollywood when [[Paramount Pictures]] signed him for the 1938 film ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1938]]'', also starring [[W. C. Fields]]. The song "[[Thanks for the Memory]]", which later became his trademark, was introduced in this film as a duet with [[Shirley Ross]] as accompanied by [[Shep Fields]] and his orchestra.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=110, 113}} The sentimental, fluid nature of the music allowed Hope's writers (he depended heavily upon joke writers throughout his career{{sfn|Lahr|1998}}) to later create variations of the song to fit specific circumstances, such as bidding farewell to troops while on tour.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=133}}

[[File:Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|Bob Hope, [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Dorothy Lamour]] in ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952)]]

As a movie star, he was best known for comedies like ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' and the highly successful "[[Road to …|Road]]" movies in which he starred with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. The series consists of seven films made between 1940 and 1962, ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). Hope had seen Lamour as a nightclub singer in New York,{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=112}} and invited her to work on his [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) tours. Lamour sometimes arrived for filming prepared with her lines, only to be baffled by completely re-written scripts or ad-lib dialogue between Hope and Crosby.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=128}} Hope and Lamour were lifelong friends, and she remains the actress most associated with his film career. Hope made movies with dozens of other [[leading lady|leading ladies]], including [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Jane Russell]] and [[Elke Sommer]].{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=174–180}}

Hope teamed with Crosby for the "Road" pictures and countless stage, radio, and television appearances over the decades, from their first meeting in 1932{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=127}} until Crosby's death in 1977. The two invested together in oil leases and other business ventures, but did not see each other socially.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=127, 137}}
[[File:Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bob Hope and Bing Crosby sing and dance during "Chicago Style" in ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952)]]
After the release of ''Road to Singapore'' (1940), Hope's screen career took off, and he had a long and successful career in the movies. After an 11-year hiatus, Hope and Crosby teamed up for the last ''Road'' movie, ''The Road to Hong Kong'' (1962), starring 28-year old [[Joan Collins]] in place of Lamour, who Hope and Crosby thought was too old for the part.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=265}} They had planned one more movie together in 1977, ''The Road to the Fountain of Youth''. Filming was postponed when Crosby was injured in a fall, and the production was cancelled when he suddenly died of heart failure that October.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=287}}

Hope starred in 54 theatrical features between 1938 and 1972,{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=41}} as well as cameos and short films. Most of Hope's later movies failed to match the success of his 1940s efforts. He was disappointed with his appearance in ''[[Cancel My Reservation]]'' (1972), his last starring film, and the movie was poorly received by critics and filmgoers.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=285–286}}  Though his career as a film star effectively ended in 1972, Hope made a few cameo appearances in films into the 1980s.

Hope was [[Master of Ceremonies|host]] of the Academy Awards ceremony fourteen times between 1939 and 1977. His feigned desire for an Academy Award became part of his act.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=154}} Although he was never nominated for an Oscar, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] honored him with four honorary awards, and in 1960, the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]]. While introducing the 1968 telecast, he quipped, "Welcome to the Academy Awards, or, as it's known at my house, [[Passover]]."{{sfn|McCaffrey|2005|p=56}}

Hope's career in broadcasting began on radio in 1934. His first regular series for [[NBC Radio]] was the ''Woodbury Soap Hour'' in 1937, a 26-week contract. A year later, ''The [[Pepsodent]] Show Starring Bob Hope'' began, and Hope signed a ten-year contract with the show's sponsor, [[Lever Brothers]]. Hope hired eight writers and paid them out of his salary of $2,500 a week. The original staff included [[Mel Shavelson]], [[Norman Panama]], [[Jack Rose (screenwriter)|Jack Rose]], [[Sherwood Schwartz]], and Schwartz's brother [[Al Schwartz (writer)|Al]]. The writing staff eventually grew to fifteen.{{sfn|Nachman|1998|p=144}} The show became the top radio program in the country. Regulars on the series included  [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and [[Barbara Jo Allen]] as spinster Vera Vague. Hope continued his lucrative career in radio through to the 1950s, when radio's popularity was overshadowed by television.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=30–32}}{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=92–103}}

=== NBC comedy specials ===

Hope did many specials for the NBC television network in the following decades, beginning in April 1950. He was one of the first people to use [[cue card]]s. The shows were often sponsored by [[General Motors]] (1955–61), [[Chrysler]] (1963–73), and [[Texaco]] (1975–85).{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=47–48}} Hope's Christmas specials were popular favorites and often featured a performance of "[[Silver Bells]]" (from his 1951 film ''[[The Lemon Drop Kid]]'') done as a duet with an often much younger female guest star (such as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Barbara Eden]], and [[Brooke Shields]]{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=160}}), or with his wife Dolores, with whom he dueted on two specials. Hope's 1970 and 1971 Christmas specials for NBC—filmed in [[Vietnam]] in front of military audiences at the height of the war—are on the list of the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Top 46 network prime-time telecasts|Top 46 U.S. network prime-time telecasts]]. Both were seen by more than 60 per cent of the U.S. households watching television.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=48}}

[[File:Bob Hope James Garner 1961.JPG|thumb|upright|Hope with [[James Garner]] (1961)]]

In 1992, Hope made a guest appearance as himself on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in the episode "[[Lisa the Beauty Queen]]" (season 4, episode 4).<ref name="Simpsons Season 4"/> Towards the end of his career, eye problems left him unable to read his cue cards.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=291}} His 90th birthday television celebration in May 1993, ''Bob Hope: The First 90 Years'', won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Variety, Music Or Comedy Special.<ref name="Emmys 1993"/> In October 1996 Hope announced that he was ending his 60-year contract with NBC, joking that he "decided to become a free agent".<ref name="Errico 1996"/> His final television special, ''Laughing with the Presidents'', was broadcast in November 1996, with host [[Tony Danza]] helping him present a personal retrospective of [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] known to the comedian. The special received poor reviews.<ref name="Seely 2005"/> Following a brief appearance at the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1997, Hope's last TV appearance was in a 1997 K-Mart commercial directed by [[Penny Marshall]].<ref name="K-Mart press release 1997"/>

=== USO ===

[[File:Hope WWII 44.jpg|left|thumb|Hope entertains soldiers during World War II]]
While aboard the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] when World War II began in September 1939, Hope volunteered to perform a special show for the passengers, during which he sang "Thanks for the Memory" with rewritten lyrics.{{sfn|Friedrich|1986|p=26}} He performed his first USO show on May 6, 1941, at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]], California,{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=113}} and continued to travel and entertain troops for the rest of World War II, later during the [[Korean War]], the Vietnam War, the third phase of the [[Lebanon Civil War]], the latter years of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], and the 1990–91 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=181–182}} His USO career lasted half a century, during which he headlined 57 tours.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=181–182}} He had a deep respect for the men and women who served in the military, and this was reflected in his willingness to go anywhere in order to entertain them.<ref name="King" /> During the Vietnam War, Hope had trouble convincing some performers to join him on tour. [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Anti-war sentiment]] was high, and Hope's pro-war stance made him a target of criticism. Some shows were drowned out by boos and others were listened to in silence.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|pp=251, 254, 258}} The tours were funded by the United States Department of Defense, his television sponsors, and by [[NBC]], the network which broadcast the television specials that were created after each tour. Many people considered him as an enabler of the war and a member of the system that made it possible.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=261}}

[[File:Bob hope lackland afb.jpg|thumb|upright|Hope at [[Lackland Air Force Base]], 1990]]

Hope recruited his own family members for USO travel. His wife, Dolores, sang from atop an armored vehicle during the Desert Storm tour, and his granddaughter, Miranda, appeared alongside Hope on an aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name="King"/> Of Hope's USO shows in World War II, writer [[John Steinbeck]], who was then working as a war correspondent, wrote in 1943:

{{quote|When the time for recognition of service to the nation in wartime comes to be considered, Bob Hope should be high on the list. This man drives himself and is driven. It is impossible to see how he can do so much, can cover so much ground, can work so hard, and can be so effective. He works month after month at a pace that would kill most people.{{sfn|Steinbeck|1958|p=65}}}}

For his service to his country through the USO, he was awarded the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] by the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1968.<ref name="Thayer award"/> A 1997 act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] named Hope an "Honorary Veteran." He remarked, "I've been given many awards in my lifetime&nbsp;— but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most&nbsp;— is the greatest honor I have ever received."{{sfn|Faith|2003|p=429}} In homage to Hope, [[Stephen Colbert]] carried a golf club on stage each night during his own week of USO performances, which were taped for his TV show, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', during the 2009 season.<ref name="LA Times June 2009"/>

=== Theater ===
Hope's first Broadway appearances, in 1927's ''The Sidewalks of New York'' and 1928's ''Ups-a-Daisy'', were minor walk-on parts.{{sfn|Faith|2003|p=403}}  He returned to Broadway in 1933 to star as Huckleberry Haines in the [[Jerome Kern]] / [[Dorothy Fields]] musical ''[[Roberta]]''.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=71}} Stints in the musicals ''[[Say When]]'', the 1936 [[Ziegfeld Follies]] (with [[Fanny Brice]]), and ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' with [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] followed.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=73–75}} Hope reprised his role as Huck Haines in a 1958 production of ''Roberta'' at [[The Muny]] Theater in [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name="The Muny 1958"/>

Hope rescued [[The Bob Hope Theatre|Eltham Little Theatre]] from closure by providing funds to buy the property. He continued his interest and support and regularly visited when in London. The Theatre was renamed in his honor in 1982.<ref name="bobhopetheatre 100th"/>

=== Critical reception ===
[[File:Jerry colonna bob hope 1940 nbc.JPG|left|thumb|With sidekick [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] in 1940]]
Hope was praised for his comedic timing, specializing in [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s and rapid-fire delivery of jokes. His style of delivery of self-deprecating jokes, first building himself up and then tearing himself down, was unique. Working tirelessly, he performed hundreds of times per year.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=158}} Early films such as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1939 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1939) and  ''[[The Paleface (1948 film)|The Paleface]]'' (1948) were financially successful and were praised by critics,{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=123, 183}} and by the mid-1940s, with his radio program getting good ratings as well, he became one of the most popular entertainers in the United States.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=153}} When Paramount threatened to stop production of the Road pictures in 1945, they received 75,000 letters in protest.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=172}} He had no faith in his skills as a dramatic actor, and his performances of that type were not as well received.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=184, 187}} Hope had been a leader in the radio genre until the late 1940s, but as his ratings began to slip, he switched to television in the 1950s, an early pioneer of that medium.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=173}} He published several books—written with [[ghostwriter]]s—about his wartime experiences.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=153}}

Although he made an effort to keep his material up-to-date, he never adapted his comic persona or his routines to any great degree. As Hollywood began to transition to the [[New Hollywood]] era in the 1960s, Hope reacted negatively such as when he hosted the [[40th Academy Awards]] in 1968, and voiced his contempt such as mocking at its delay due to the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and greeting attending younger actors on stage like [[Dustin Hoffman]] (who was 30 at the time) as children.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|page=409}}</ref> By the 1970s his popularity was beginning to wane with soldiers and with the movie-going public.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=255, 276, 314}} However, he continued doing USO tours into the 1980s,{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=161}} and he continued to appear on television into the 1990s. [[Nancy Reagan]] called him "America's most honored citizen and our favorite clown."{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=312}}

[[File:Bob Hope playing golf in the Oval Office.gif|thumb|upright|left|Bob Hope, a golf fan, putting a golf ball into an ashtray held by President [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[Oval Office]] in 1973]]

Hope was an avid golfer, playing in as many as 150 charity tournaments a year.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=57}} Introduced to the game in the 1930s while performing in [[Winnipeg]],<ref name="Manitoba Historic Society 1988"/> he eventually played to a four [[Golf handicap|handicap]]. His love for the game—and the humor he could find in it—made him a sought-after [[foursome (golf)|foursome]] member. He once remarked that President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave up golf for painting&nbsp;– "fewer strokes, you know."<ref name="panews May 1980"/> "It's wonderful how you can start out with three strangers in the morning, play 18 holes, and by the time the day is over you have three solid enemies," he once said.<ref name="Golf Hall of Fame" />

A golf club became an integral [[Theatrical property|prop]] for Hope during the standup segments of his television specials and USO shows. In 1978, he putted against a then two-year-old [[Tiger Woods]] in a television appearance with [[James Stewart]] on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.<ref name="Fox Sports 2012"/>

The [[Bob Hope Classic]], founded in 1960, made history in 1995 when Hope teed up for the opening round in a foursome which included Presidents [[Gerald Ford]], [[George H.W.

=== Extramarital affairs ===
Hope had a reputation as a womanizer and continued to see other women in spite of his marriage.{{sfn|Quirk|1998|pp=82, 90}} In 1949, while Hope was in Dallas on a publicity tour for his radio show, he met starlet [[Barbara Payton]], a contract player at [[Universal Studios]], who at the time was on her own public relations jaunt. Shortly thereafter, Hope set Payton up in an apartment in Hollywood.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=65}} The arrangement soured as Hope was not able to satisfy Payton's definition of generosity and her need for attention.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|pp=66, 67}} Hope paid her off to end the affair quietly. Payton later revealed the affair in an article printed in July 1956 in ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]''.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=311}} "Hope was&nbsp;... at times a mean-spirited individual with the ability to respond with a ruthless vengeance when sufficiently provoked."{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=313}} His advisors counseled him to avoid further publicity by ignoring the ''Confidential'' exposé.{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=313}} "Barbara's&nbsp;... revelations caused a minor ripple&nbsp;... and then quickly sank without causing any appreciable damage to Bob Hope's legendary career."{{sfn|O'Dowd|2006|p=313}}  According to [[Arthur Marx]]'s Hope biography, ''The Secret Life of Bob Hope'', Hope's subsequent long-term affair with actress [[Marilyn Maxwell]] was so open that the Hollywood community routinely referred to her as "Mrs. Bob Hope".<ref name="Arthur Marx 1993"/>

At the age of 95, Hope made an appearance at the 50th anniversary of the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] with [[Milton Berle]] and [[Sid Caesar]].<ref name="Gallo 1998"/> Two years later, he was present at the opening of the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment at the [[Library of Congress]]. The Library of Congress has presented two major exhibitions about Hope's life&nbsp;– "Hope for America: Performers, Politics and Pop Culture" and "Bob Hope and American Variety."<ref name="myloc hopeforamerica"/><ref name="loc bobhope"/>

Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003.<ref name="USA Today May 2003"/> He is among a small group of notable centenarians in the field of [[List of centenarians (actors, filmmakers and entertainers)|entertainment]]. To mark this event, the intersection of [[Hollywood and Vine]] in Los Angeles was named "Bob Hope Square" and his centennial was declared "Bob Hope Day" in 35 states. Even at 100, Hope maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping, "I'm so old, they've canceled my [[blood type]]."<ref name="bbcdeath"/> He converted to Roman Catholicism late in life.<ref name="seeing-stars St Charles"/>

[[File:BobHopeUSO.jpg|thumb|right|150px|At a [[USO]] show]]
In 1998, a prepared obituary by [[The Associated Press]] was inadvertently released on the Internet, prompting Hope's death to be announced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].<ref name="c-span June 1998"/>{{sfn|Quirk|1998|p=313}} Hope remained in good health until old age, though he became slightly frail.{{sfn|Grudens|2002|p=148}} In June 2000, he spent nearly a week in a California hospital after being hospitalized for [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].<ref name="CNN June 2000"/> In August 2001, he spent close to two weeks in the hospital recovering from [[pneumonia]].<ref name="guardian September 2001"/>

== Estate ==
Hope's [[Modernist]] {{convert|23366|sqft|m2|0|sing=on}} home, built to resemble a volcano, was designed in 1973 by [[John Lautner]]. Located above [[Palm Springs]], it has panoramic views of the [[Coachella Valley]] and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]]. The house was placed on the market for the first time in February 2013 with an asking price of $50 million.<ref name="NYTimes February 2013" /> Hope also owned a home which had been custom built for him in 1939 on an {{convert|87000|sqft|m2|0|sing=on}} lot in Toluca Lake.
