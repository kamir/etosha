==Career==

===Miami radio and television===
A [[CBS]] staff announcer, whom King met by chance, suggested he go to [[Florida]] which was a growing media market with openings for inexperienced broadcasters.  King went to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and after initial setbacks, he got his first job in radio. The manager of a small station, WAHR<ref name="fussman">{{cite interview |last= King|first= Larry |interviewer= Cal Fussman |title= Larry King on Getting Seduced |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yD8PzFFNFU#t=226 |callsign=PBS Digital Studios  |city= Los Angeles |date= 2001 |program= Blank on Blank |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}</ref>  (now [[WMBM]]) in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], hired him to clean up and perform miscellaneous tasks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whyfame.com/celebrities/television/larry_king_60696.php|title=Larry King Biography|publisher=WhyFame|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> When one of their announcers quit, they put King on the air. His first broadcast was on May 1, 1957, when he worked as the [[disc jockey]] from 9&nbsp;a.m. to noon.<ref>{{cite web|author=Caitlin A.Johnson|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/28/earlyshow/leisure/books/main2523708.shtml|title=Larry King Celebrates 50 Years On Air|publisher= [[CBS News]]|date= February 11, 2009|accessdate= February 18, 2012}}</ref> He also did two afternoon newscasts and a sportscast. He was paid $55 a week.

He acquired the name Larry King when the general manager Marshall Simmonds said that Zeiger was too ethnic and difficult to remember, so Larry chose the surname ''King'', which he got from an ad in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' for King's Wholesale Liquor, minutes before air.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christina and Jordana|url=http://www.schemamag.ca/archive2/2010/07/goodbye_larry_king_1.php|title=Goodbye Larry King|publisher=Schema Magazine|date= July 5, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref>  Within two years, he legally changed his name.<ref name=ss2>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-01-31/features/8801070156_1_larry-king-larry-zeiger-oral-roberts/2|title=The Nine Lives Of Larry King|work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>

He started doing interviews on a mid-morning show for [[WIOD]], at Pumpernik's Restaurant in Miami Beach.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pekkanen, John |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20075993,00.html|title=While Most of America Sleeps, Larry King Talks to Six Million People All Through the Night| work = [[People (magazine)|People]] |date=March 10, 1980|accessdate= February 18, 2012}}</ref> He would interview anyone who walked in.

His Miami radio show launched him to local stardom. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted ''Miami Undercover'', airing Sunday nights at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on WPST-TV Channel 10 (now [[WPLG]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon Bershad|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/from-the-mediaite-vault-larry-king-takes-on-gangsters-and-loses-in-1961/|title=From the Mediaite Vault: Larry King Takes on Gangsters (and Loses) in 1961| work = [[Mediaite]] (blog)|date= June 30, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> On the show, he moderated debates on important issues of the time.

King credits his success on local television to the assistance of comedian [[Jackie Gleason]], whose national television variety show was being filmed in Miami Beach during this period. "That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami," King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame. "He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn't like the set, so we broke into the general manager's office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/kin0int-1|title=The Interview King|publisher=[[Academy of Achievement]]|date=June 29, 1996|accessdate= March 3, 2008}}</ref>

It was broadcast live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time.

At 3&nbsp;a.m., he would allow callers to discuss any topic they pleased with him,<ref name=c82/> until the end of the program, when he expressed his own political opinions. That segment was called ''[[Open Phone America]]''. Many stations in the western time zones would carry ''Open Phone America'' live, followed by the guest interview on tape delay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/46222406/|title=The Gettysburg Times from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania · Page 13|work=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

Unlike many interviewers, King has a direct, non-confrontational approach.

In a show dedicated to the surviving Beatles, King asked [[George Harrison]]'s widow about the song "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]," which was written about Harrison's first wife. He seemed surprised when she did not know very much about the song.

Throughout his career King has interviewed many of the leading figures of his time. According to CNN, King has performed more than 30,000 interviews in his career.<ref name=fastfacts/>

When asked what he'd like his legacy to be, King, referring to himself, said "His life led to more people having information that they didn't have before, and he taught us a lot and we learned a lot and enjoyed it at the same time. He brought a great deal of pride to his business."<ref>[http://podcastone.com/We-The-People-with-Jesse-Ventura ''We The People! with Jesse Ventura'', "Larry King Takes On Politics, Pot & the President", uploaded January 9, 2015, recorded November 18, 2014.
