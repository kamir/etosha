'''''The Onion''''' is an American digital media company and [[news satire]] organization. 
It runs an entertainment website featuring [[satire|satirical]] articles reporting on international, national, and local news. It also runs a non-satirical entertainment section known as ''[[The A.V. Club]]''. Starting in 2007, the organization published satirical news audio and video online, as the "Onion News Network".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/theonion?blend=1&ob=4|title=Канал користувача TheOnion|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> In 2014, the Onion News Network was folded back into the original brand as "the Onion Video".

''The Onion''{{'}}s articles comment on current events, both real and fictional. It parodies traditional news websites with stories, editorials, [[op-ed]] pieces, and [[Vox populi|man-in-the-street]] interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after that of the [[Associated Press]]. Its humor often depends on presenting mundane, everyday events as newsworthy, surreal or alarming.

''The Onion'''s parent company, Onion Inc., also runs an entertainment website called ''The A.V. Club'' that features interviews and reviews of various newly released media, as well as other weekly features. In 2013, Onion Inc. launched Onion Labs, an advertising agency.<ref name="Onion Labs">{{cite web|title=Onion Labs |url=http://labs.theonion.com/ |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref> Originally a print publication, ''The Onion'' launched its website in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/09/changes_at_the_onion_america_s_finest_news_source_adjusts_to_internet_speed.html |title=A Disturbance in the Force |author=Farhad Manjoo |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=December 13, 2013 |publisher=Slate}}</ref> Print publishing ceased in December 2013.

==History==
Tim Keck and Christopher Johnson, juniors at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], founded ''The Onion'' there in 1988.<ref name="onionnation">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/07/AR2008110701942_pf.html |title=Onion Nation: A Look Inside the Offices of ''The Onion'' |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26 |first=Wells |last=Tower}}</ref> The following year, they sold it to Editor-in-Chief [[Scott Dikkers]] and Advertising Sales Manager Peter Haise for less than $20,000 ($16,000, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'';<ref name="onionnation">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/07/AR2008110701942_pf.html Onion Nation], a November 16, 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article</ref> a 2003 ''[[Business 2.0]]'' article reported the figure was $19,000<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/08/28/bus2.feat.onion.site/index.html|title=The Onion: Funny site is no joke|work=[[Business 2.0]]|publisher=CNN|date=29 August 2003|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>). Reportedly, it was Chris Johnson's uncle, Wm. Nels Johnson, who came up with the idea to name the paper ''The Onion''.<ref>[http://media.www.spectatornews.com/media/storage/paper218/news/2007/02/08/Showcase/Layers.Of.The.Onion-2706494.shtml?sourcedomain=www.spectatornews.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com Parodies of current events catch interest of unlikely readers], Kathlyn Hotynski, ''The Spectator'' (University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire), February 8, 2007.</ref> "People always ask questions about where the name ''The Onion'' came from," said former President Sean Mills in an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]''; "and, when I recently asked Tim Keck, who was one of the founders, he told me...literally that his uncle said he should call it ''The Onion'' when he saw him and Chris Johnson eating an onion sandwich. They had literally just cut up the onion and put it on bread." According to former Editorial Manager, Chet Clem, their food budget was so low when they started the paper that they were down to white bread and onions.<ref name=DS>[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with ''The Onion'']], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 24, 2007.</ref> This account was recently disputed by the current editor of ''The Onion'', Cole Bolton, during an event at the [[University of Chicago]]. Cole Bolton called Sean Mills' account "the dumbest explanation" and asserted that it is likely wrong. According to Bolton, the most plausible explanation is that ''The Onion'' was mocking a campus newsletter called "The Union."<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PaI5dC3IM8&feature=youtu.be&t=48m33s</ref>

At first, ''The Onion'' was a success in a limited number of cities and towns, notably those with major universities (e.g. [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]). Originally the entire bottom three inches of the paper could be cut off for coupons to local Milwaukee and Madison establishments, such as inexpensive student-centered eateries and video rental stores.

The creation of its website in 1996 allowed it to receive national attention in the US. In early 2001, the company relocated its editorial offices from Madison to New York City. The website continues to make occasional Madison references, placing odd stories in surrounding towns or running photographs of local landmarks to illustrate stories set elsewhere. In April 2007, ''The Onion'' launched The Onion News Network, a web video sendup of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] TV news.

The paper's founders went on to become publishers of other [[alternative weekly|alternative weeklies]]: Keck of the [[Seattle]] weekly ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' and Johnson of the [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] ''[[Weekly Alibi]]''.

Scott Dikkers is ''The Onion''{{'}}s longest-serving Editor-in-Chief (1988–1999, 2005–2008).<ref>[http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2001/12/07/onion-co-founder-extols-the-virtues-of-humor/ Onion co-founder extols the virtues of humor | Yale Daily News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090530000012/http://www.time.com/time/digital/cyberelite/43.html Cyber Elite], ''Onion'' print editions Oct. 14–21, 1999, May 25 – June 1, 2005, July 23–30, 2008</ref>

In 2003, ''The Onion'' was purchased by David Schafer, a fund manager and investor in the company from then long time owner Peter Haise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/08/28/bus2.feat.onion.site/index.html|title=The Onion: Funny site is no joke|work=[[Business 2.0]]|publisher=CNN|date=29 August 2003|accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref>

On March 13, 2006, ''The Onion'' launched a [[YouTube]] channel, presented as a parody of American television news. {{As of|2014}}, the channel has over 740,000 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Onion|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/TheOnion|title=TheOnion From ''The Onion''|publisher=MinOnline|accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>

In April 2009, ''The Onion'' was awarded a [[Peabody Award]] that noted "the satirical tabloid's online send-up of 24-hour [[United States cable news|cable-TV news]] was hilarious, trenchant and not infrequently hard to distinguish from the real thing."<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/onion-news-network 68th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2009.</ref>

In July 2009, various news outlets began reporting rumors of an impending sale of ''The Onion'' to a large media company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sandoval|first=Greg|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10287280-93.html|title=No Joke: Report says ''The Onion'' discussing sale|publisher=news.cnet.com|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> A further rumor indicated that such a sale would be announced on Monday, July 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan Tate|url=http://gawker.com/5317240/onion-sale-announcement-monday:|title=Onion Sale Announcement Monday?|publisher=Gawker.com|date=17 July 2009|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> The purported sale was ultimately revealed as fictional Publisher Emeritus T. Herman Zweibel stating he'd sold the publication to a Chinese company, resulting in a week-long series of Chinese-related articles and features throughout The Onion website and publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/columnists/well_ive_sold_the_paper_to|title=''Well, I've Sold The Paper To The Chinese''|publisher=Theonion.com|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan Tate|url=http://gawker.com/5318527/chopped-onion-makes-us-cry|title=Chopped ''Onion'' Makes Us Cry|publisher=Gawker.com|date=20 July 2009|accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> On Wednesday, July 22, 2009, ''The Onion'' Editor [[Joe Randazzo]] clarified the issue on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'', saying: "I'm sure there are many Chinese conglomerates out there that would love to buy ''The Onion''.

In August 2011, ''The Onion''{{'}}s website began testing a [[paywall]] model requiring a $2.95 monthly or $29.95 annual charge from non-U.S. visitors who want to read more than about five stories within 30 days. "We are testing a meter internationally as readers in those markets are already used to paying directly for some (other) content, particularly in the UK where we have many readers," said Onion, Inc. chief technology officer Michael Greer.<ref>[http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-the-onion-asks-overseas-readers-to-pay-/ The Onion Testing A Metered Paid Model] ''paidContent:UK'', August 5, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/08/the-onions-cto-its-paywall-experiment-is-just-that/ The Onion’s CTO: Its paywall experiment is just that] ''Nieman Journalism Lab'', August 8, 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/about-the-onions-new-paid-content-system,60129/ About The ''Onion's'' new paid content system...] ''The A.V.

In September 2011, it was announced that ''The Onion'' would move its entire editorial operation to Chicago by the summer of 2012. The news of the move left many of the writers—who moved with the publication from Madison to New York City in 2000—"blindsided", putting them in a position to decide whether to uproot themselves from New York City and follow the publication to Chicago, which was already home to the company's corporate headquarters.<ref name="digital_journal_201109">[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/311837 ''The Onion'' moving to Chicago, leaves writers ‘blindsided’] ''Digital Journal'', September 22, 2011</ref><ref name="huff_post_20110921">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/21/the-onion-moving-to-chicago_n_974438.html The Onion Could Move To Chicago, Forcing NYC Writers To Relocate Or Leave] ''Huffington Post'', September 21, 2011</ref><ref name="chicago_tribune_201109">[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-the-onion-to-move-editorial-staff-to-chicago-headquarters-20110922,0,6055722.story ''The Onion'' to move editorial staff to Chicago headquarters] ''Huffington Post'', September 221, 2011</ref><ref name="fishbowlNY_201109">[http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/the-onion-is-leaving-new-york_b43461 The Onion is Leaving New York] ''FishbowNY'', September 22, 2011</ref><ref name="chicago_suntimes_201109">[http://www.suntimes.com/business/7800527-420/the-onion-to-move-editorial-staff-to-chicago.html ''The Onion'' to move editorial staff to Chicago] ''Chicago Sun-Times'', September 22, 2011</ref><ref name="poynter_201109">[http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/146882/the-onion-to-move-editorial-staff-from-new-york-to-chicago/ ''The Onion'' editorial staff to move from New York to Chicago] ''Poynter.org'', September 22, 2011</ref> At a comedy show on September 27, 2011, then-Editor [[Joe Randazzo]] announced that he would not be joining the staff in Chicago.<ref name="huff_post_20110929">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/29/the-onion-to-lose-editor-joe-randazzo_n_987534.html ''The Onion'' Editor Joe Randazzo To Leave Ahead Of Chicago Move] ''Huffington Post'', September 29, 2011</ref> Further details of the internal issues surrounding the Chicago move—including an attempt for writers to find a new owner—are detailed in March 2012 articles in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]].<ref name="atlantic_wire_201203">[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2012/03/onions-bumpy-ride-chicago/50149/ The Onion's Bumpy Ride to Chicago] ''The Atlantic'', March 2012</ref><ref name="new_york_magazine_201203">[http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/03/onion-writers-refuse-to-leave-new-york.html Writers at The Onion Refusing to Leave New York for Chicago] ''New York Magazine'', March 22, 2012</ref> According to a March 31, 2012, article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', founding editor [[Scott Dikkers]] returned to the publication stating that he hopes to find a "younger and hungrier" pool of talent than what was available in New York City.

On November 8, 2013, Onion Inc.

In June 2014, ''The Onion'' launched the spinoff website [[ClickHole]], which parodies so-called "[[clickbait]]" websites such as [[BuzzFeed]] and [[Upworthy]] that capitalize on viral content.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/06/clickhole_the_onion_s_new_site_is_more_than_a_buzzfeed_parody.html/ Area Humor Site Discovers Clickbait] ''Slate'', Jun 19, 2014</ref>

==Regular features==
Regular features of ''The Onion'' include:
* "Statshot", an illustrated statistical snapshot which parodies "''[[USA Today]]'' Snapshots"
* "Infographics", with a bulleted lists of jokes on a theme
* Opinion columns, including mock editorials, point-counterpoints, and pieces from regular columnists 
* Bizarre [[horoscope]]s
* Slideshows that parody content aggregation sites like Huffington Post and Buzzfeed usually accompanied by a "[[click-bait]]"-style headline
* "News in Photos" that feature a photograph and caption with no accompanying story
* "American Voices" (formerly called "What Do You Think?"), a mock [[vox populi]] [[opinion poll|survey]] on a topical current event. There are three respondents, down from the original six, for each topic, who seem to have been chosen intentionally to represent a diverse selection of ages, races, and socio-economic classes. Although their names and professions change daily, photos of the same six people are almost always used. One of them is often described as a [[systems analyst]].
* An [[editorial cartoon]] drawn by "Kelly", a fictional character; the cartoons are actually the work of [[Ward Sutton]].<ref name="kelly">[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-cavanaugh29mar29,0,1927201.story Hackwork hacked], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 29, 2007.

''The Onion'' website is updated every day. A late 2012 redesign saw theonion.com move to a [[fully responsive]] format for better navigation and use on mobile and tablet devices. The A.V. Club followed, becoming fully responsive in late 2013.

===Onion News Network===
In March 2007, ''The Onion'' launched ''[[Onion News Network]]'', a daily web video broadcast that had been in production since mid-2006, with a story about an illegal immigrant taking an executive's $800,000-a-year job for $600,000 a year. ''The Onion'' has reportedly invested about $1 million in the production and has hired 15 new staffers to focus on the production of this video broadcast.<ref name="Sam Schechner, The Wall Street Journal">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117459985897745975-mETUwZECHpnJSRMSyaQqQUA9x8A_20070421.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top|title=Press 'Play' for Satire: March 23, 2007 ''The Wall Street Journal'' Article|date=March 23, 2007}}</ref> [[Carol Kolb]], former Editor-in-Chief of ''The Onion'', is the ONN's head writer; Will Graham is the showrunner and Executive Producer. On February 3, 2009, ''The Onion'' launched a spin-off of the ONN, the ''Onion Sports Network.''

In a ''[[Wikinews]]'' interview in November 2007, former ''Onion'' President Mills said the ONN had been a huge hit. "We get over a million downloads a week, which makes it one of the more successful produced-for-the-Internet videos," said Mills. "If we're not the most successful, we're one of the most. It is a 24 hour news network. We have a new show that is part of the platform, but we also have a Sunday morning talk show that's called ''In The Know'' and we just launched a morning show this last week called ''Today Now''. It has been really exciting; we'll have some new shows, show some archive footage and do some more in sports over the next year."<ref name=DS/>

In January 2011, ''The Onion'' launched two TV shows on cable networks.

===Continuing series===
To further invoke the atmosphere of a 24-hour network, ''The Onion'' produces the following video series:
* ''Today Now!'': ''TN'' is a parody of morning lifestyle and news programs such as [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]''. Hosted by Jim Haggerty (Brad Holbrook) and Tracy Gill (Tracy Toth), the style is typical of the breezy style often found in morning network television shows, with the presenters either uncritical or completely oblivious to the subject matter presented, regardless of the absurdity of the subject (e.g., Haggerty's earnest question about whether or not an omelet recipe strictly requires a metal shoe-horn to measure the butter into the pan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/video/chef_cooks_dream_omelet_from|title=Chef Cooks 'Dream Omelet' From Recipe That Came To Him In A Dream|publisher=The Onion|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> The series was featured within ''Porkin Across America''.
* ''War For The White House'': ONN's continuing coverage of Presidential and midterm elections, opening with a dramatic video apparently depicting Air Force One and a squadron of fighter planes seemingly attacking the White House, mocking the intense, over-the-top style that seems to have become typical in straight news coverage. Notable for its consistent use of military terminology (e.g. "Election Analysis Bunker") and deadpan style.
* ''The Onion Review'': Weekly news updates from America's Finest News Source
* ''Onion Special Report'': In-depth news coverage accompanied by additional news coverage on theonion.com
* ''Onion Film Standard'': Onion Film Critic Peter K. Rosenthal (Ron Rains) reviews movies both new and old.
* ''Onion Tips'': A self-help style video series that gives suggestions for how people can better themselves and their lives
* OSN: A reference to ESPN, OSN usually features clips from SportsDome, a parody of ESPN's SportsCenter. The clips usually focus on specific parodies of SportsCenter segments such as the Budweiser Hot Seat, which becomes [http://www.theonion.com/content/video/tom_coughlin_retires_from_family The Steam Room] on OSN. Hosts present in the jocular style synonymous with ESPN and sportscasters on sets that are near-identical knockoffs of the SportsCenter studios. On January 11, 2011, cable network [[Comedy Central]] launched the "Onion SportsDome", an off-shoot of the OSN feature, marking the first time an ONN feature became a full-fledged television series. It has since been cancelled.
* ''News Room'': A parody of [[breaking news]] segments that appear during commercial breaks or replays on 24-hour news networks. ''News Room'' is set in the fictional [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[United States cable news|cable news]] television network's news room with TV's and switchboards in the background.
* ''Tough Season'': A mockumentary-style series examining the world of [[fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]] starring real NFL athletes
* ''StarFix'': Parody of ''[[Access Hollywood]]''

===YouTube original programming===
In 2012, ''The Onion'' launched a series of YouTube videos produced by its Onion Digital Studios division, funded in part by a grant from YouTube and exclusive to the site. Series produced so far:
* ''[[Sex House]]'': A dark satire of reality show culture and negligent producers.
* ''Lake Dredge Appraisal'': A show centering around the dredged salvage of a lake, appraised of its worth on public access television.
* ''Trouble Hacking with Drew Cleary'': A mock Life Hacking Q and A series.
* ''Horrifying Planet'': A [[nihilism|nihilistic]] parody of nature documentaries.
* ''Onion Talks'': A satire of [[TED Talks]].
* ''Porkin' Across America with Jim Haggerty'': An on-the-road food reality show featuring Jim Haggerty from ''Today Now''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tepper|first=Rachel|title=The Onion Debuts Fake Food Show 'Porkin' Across America'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/the-onion-porkin-across-america_n_1959247.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=February 18, 2015|date=October 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Film==
{{Main|The Onion Movie}}
''The Onion Movie'' is a [[direct-to-video]] film written by then-''Onion'' editor [[Robert D. Siegel]] and writer [[Todd Hanson]] and directed by [[Tom Kuntz]] and Mike Maguire (both under the [[pseudonym]] James Kleiner).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392878/ The Untitled Onion Movie]</ref>

Created in 2003, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] was on board to release the movie, originally called ''The Untitled Onion Movie'', but at some point in the process, directors Tom Kuntz and Mike Maguire and writer Robert Siegel walked away from the project.

In 2006, [[New Regency Productions]] took over the production of the troubled project. After two years of being in [[Development hell|limbo]], the film was released on DVD on June 3, 2008. It is now credited as being directed by James Kleiner but still written by Hanson and Siegel.

In the spring of 2014, former ''Onion'' president, publisher, and CEO Peter Haise filed a lawsuit Palm Beach County court against the publication's current chairman David K. Schafer with regards to a missing "Executive Producer" credit on the failed film. As stated in the lawsuit, "Onion, Inc. has admitted that Haise was involved in and should have been named as an Executive Producer of the Film, and that the omission in the credits listed for the Film was an error."<ref name="browardpalmbeach_20140630">[http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2014/06/the_onion_founders_locked_in_hilarious_palm_beach_county_lawsuit.php "The Onion Founders Locked in Hilarious Palm Beach County Lawsuit"] ''New Times Broward-Palm Beach'', June 30, 2014</ref>

== Controversies ==

===U.S. Presidential Seal dispute===
In September 2005, the assistant counsel to President [[George W. Bush]], Grant M. Dixton, wrote a [[cease-and-desist]] letter to ''The Onion'', asking the paper to stop using the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]], which is used in an online segment poking fun at the President through parodies of his weekly radio address. The law governing the Presidential Seal is contained in {{usc|18|713}}:

{{quote|Whoever knowingly displays any printed or other likeness of the great seal of the United States, or of the seals of the President or the Vice President of the United States, or the seal of the United States Senate, or the seal of the United States House of Representatives, or the seal of the United States Congress, or any facsimile thereof, in, or in connection with, any advertisement, poster, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication, public meeting, play, motion picture, telecast, or other production, or on any building, monument, or stationery, ''for the purpose of conveying, or in a manner reasonably calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States'' or by any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

By [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]], President Richard Nixon specifically enumerated the allowed uses of the Presidential Seal, which are more restrictive than the above title ({{ExecutiveOrder|11649}}), but which allows for exceptions to be granted upon formal request.<ref>{{cite web|title= Executive Order 11649 – Regulations governing the seals of the President and the Vice President of the United States|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=59106|publisher=American Presidency Project}}</ref>

''The Onion'' responded with a letter asking for formal use of the Seal in accordance with the Executive Order, while still maintaining that the use is legitimate. The letter written by Rochelle H. Klaskin, ''The Onion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lawyer, is quoted in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as saying "It is inconceivable that anyone would think that, by using the seal, ''The Onion'' intends to 'convey... sponsorship or approval' by the president,"  but then went on to ask that the letter be considered a formal application asking for permission to use the seal.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/24/business/24onion.html Protecting the Presidential Seal.

===85th Academy Awards controversy===
During the [[85th Academy Awards]], a post from ''The Onion''{{'}}s Twitter account called 9-year-old [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] nominee [[Quvenzhané Wallis]] "a [[cunt]]". The post was deleted within an hour, but not before hundreds of angry responses.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57571025-93/the-onion-deletes-offensive-tweet-about-child-oscar-nominee/| title=The Onion deletes offensive tweet about child Oscar nominee | work=[[CNET]]| accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref> CEO Steve Hannah issued an apology to Wallis and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], calling the remarks "crude and offensive" and "No person should be subjected to such a senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/02/25/onion-apology-oscars-wallis/1946327/| title = 'The Onion' issues apology for tasteless Twitter remark| work=USA Today| first=Korina| last=Lopez| date=25 February 2013}}</ref> Scott Dikkers, who was Vice President Creative Development for the publication at the time, said in a Monday{{When|date=March 2014}} interview that the publication had sent a note of apology to Quvenzhané and her family but also stated, "She's a big star now.

==As a political actor==
Several commentators have characterized the ''Onion'' as being more overtly political (with a specifically liberal bent) since the move to Chicago. Noreen Malone, characterizing the publication as having a left-leaning outlook, said "The best op-eds in the country are written by the staff of ''The Onion'', though they're often published as news articles. The satirical paper ... still does plenty of hilarious articles on the mundane ... but its writing on current events has become increasingly biting."<ref name=malone>{{cite web |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114556/onion-countrys-best-op-ed-page-seriously |title=The Onion Is The Country’s Best Op-Ed Page. Seriously. |author=Noreen Malone |date=August 30, 2014 |work=New Republic |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> Malone, like other pundits,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/the-onion-denies-taking-a-serious-line-on-syria#3uggght |title=The Onion Denies Taking A Serious Line On Syria |author=Rosie Gray |date=August 28, 2013 |work=BuzzFeed |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> specifically noted the Onion's sharp take on the [[Syrian Civil War]], with [[David Weigel]] characterizing the publication's stance as effectively being "advocacy for intervention in Syria". Weigel attributed the trend toward more news satire – including political news satire – as being a byproduct the publication's shorter turnaround times after the internet version became the main version, endangering the Onion of becoming a "hivemind version of [[Andy Borowitz]], telling liberals that what they already think is not only true but oh-so-arch".<ref name=weigel>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/09/03/the_onion_not_funny_a_slatepitches_special_report.html |title=The Onion: Not Funny. (A #SlatePitches Special Report.) |author=David Weigel |date=September 3, 2013 |work=Slate |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> [[Farhad Manjoo]] similarly attributed the publication's "more strident" vibe to the exigencies of the internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/09/changes_at_the_onion_america_s_finest_news_source_adjusts_to_internet_speed.html |title=A Disturbance in the Force |author=Farhad Manjoo |date=September 5, 2013 |work=Slate |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> Conversely, conservative political website ''[[Breitbart (website)|Breitbart]]'' has long condemned the ''Onion''{{'}}s political effect; ''Breitbar'' pundit Christian Toto attributed the Onion's kid-glove handling of [[Barack Obama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2009/09/24/Cowardly-Onion-Ignores-Obama--Ridicules-Reagans-Alzheimers |title=Cowardly 'Onion' Ignores Obama, Ridicules Reagan's Alzheimers |author=Christian Toto |date=September 24, 2009 |work=Breitbart |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> to "the left's inability to mock one of their own",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/05/14/obama-loses-onion |title=Obama Loses The Onion on Benghazi-Gate |author=Christian Toto |date=September 29, 2009 |work=Breitbart |accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref> for instance.

In 2014, [[Emmett Rensin]] claimed the ''Onion'' is an important if unintentional fomenter of Marxist thought in America: "breathing new life into a far-left movement ... the vanguard of revolution—the paper most dedicated to the overthrowing [of] capitalism in the United States today—is none other than ''The Onion''".<ref name=Rensin>{{cite web |url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116479/onion-americas-finest-marxist-news-source |title=The Onion Has Become America's Finest Marxist News Source |first=Emmett|last=Rensin |authorlink=Emmett Rensin |date=February 5, 2014 |work=New Republic |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Examples of indictments of [[false consciousness]], commodity fetishization, and valorization of the [[invisible hand]] also abound, according to Rensin, who attributes the material to the humorists' need to work from "obvious, intuitive truth—the kind necessary for any kind of broadly appealing humor" rather than a conscious decision to promote Marxism.<ref name=Rensin />
