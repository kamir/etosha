He said he's thinking of taking a year off or even trying to become a standup comic. 'I'd rather avoid the real world as long as possible - I am going to law school - and continue to party,' he said, flashing a broad smile." }}</ref> 

Martin graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1995. During his time there, he wrote a 224-word poem about alcoholism<ref>{{cite web|title=Demetri Martin's Palindrome|url=http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/panorama/Literature/Martin/MartinPalindrome.html|work=Yale University|publisher=Mathematics Department|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= If it's hip to be square, then comedian Demetri Martin must be the coolest man on the planet |work= The Sunday Times |location= London, England |date= October 19, 2003 |first= Stephen |last= Armstrong |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=10035F27D969F85C&p_docnum=124&p_queryname=11 }}</ref> as a project for a [[fractal geometry]] class, which became a well known [[palindrome|palindromic]] poem.

After graduating high school as the valedictorian, Martin enrolled at Yale and graduated with grades that landed him a scholarship at NYU. While at law school, Martin became bored with the life of class by day and library by night and decided to spice things up. He began to neglect his studies and attend class in bizarre fashion, one time suiting up in a full gorilla costume. As his interest in comedy grew, Martin began to debate dropping out of school. His parents encouraged him to stay in school, but Martin's father told Demetri to do what he was most passionate about. His father died shortly there after in 1994, and Martin then decided to give comedy a chance. What has ensued so far has been a remarkable start in the comedy field thanks to a perspective that the world has never seen before." }}</ref> and left to become a stand-up comedian.<ref>{{cite news |title= Is the rest of the world any better? |work= The Times |location= London, England |date= August 21, 2003 |first= Alex |last= O'Connell |page= 5 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0FD16583C89B5EA2&p_docnum=71&p_queryname=9 }}</ref>

== Career ==
In 2001, Martin caught his first big break in stand-up comedy when he appeared on Comedy Central's stand-up showcase ''[[Premium Blend]]''. At the [[2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] he won the [[Perrier award]] with his show ''If I...''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2101150/entry/2101158/ | title = Diary: A Weeklong Electronic Journal | first = Demetri | last = Martin | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = May 25, 2004 | accessdate = February 24, 2007 }}</ref> The show was turned into a [[BBC]] television special in 2004. From 2003 to 2004, Martin wrote for ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/browse/m/demetri_martin.jhtml | title = Demetri Martin Bio | publisher = [[Comedy Central]] | accessdate = March 7, 2008}}</ref> In 2004, Martin had his own ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' stand-up special. His special was divided into three parts. In the first, he performed in traditional stand-up comedy fashion. In the second segment, he used humorous drawings as visual aids, which would serve either as the punchline or a background. During the third segment, he played a guitar and put on a pseudo-play where he would strum his guitar while alternating between playing harmonica and talking; some of his comedian friends dressed as [[fairy|fairies]] and [[dragon]]s acted according to the story he was telling, detailing the magical land from where his jokes came. Martin's mother and grandmother also appeared.

Starting in late 2005, he was credited as a contributor on ''The Daily Show'', on which he appeared as the named "Senior Youth Correspondent" and hosted a segment called "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Trendspotting|Trendspotting]]". He used this segment to talk about so-called hip trends among youth such as [[hookah]]s, [[wine]], [[guerilla marketing]] and [[Xbox 360]]. A piece about [[social networking]] featured his profile on [[MySpace]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/contributors/demetri_martin.jhtml | title = News Team: Demetri Martin | work = [[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]] | publisher = [[Comedy Central]] | accessdate = February 24, 2007 }}</ref> On March 22, 2007, Martin made another appearance on ''The Daily Show'', talking about the [[Viacom]] lawsuit against [[Google]] and [[YouTube]]. He is no longer a ''Daily Show'' contributor as of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=News Team|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/news-team|website=The Daily Show|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>

He has recorded a comedy [[CD]]/[[DVD]] titled ''[[These Are Jokes]]'', which was released on September 26, 2006. This album also features ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' member [[Will Forte]] and stand-up comedian [[Leo Allen]].
Martin returned to ''The Daily Show'' on March 22, 2006, as the new Youth Correspondent, calling his segment "Professional Important News with Demetri Martin". In 2007, he starred in a [[Fountains of Wayne]] music video for "[[Someone to Love (Fountains of Wayne song)|Someone to Love]]" as Seth Shapiro, a character in the song. He also starred in the video for the [[Travis (band)|Travis]] single "[[Selfish Jean]]", in which he wears multiple T-shirts with lyrics written on them.
On September 2, 2007, Martin appeared on the season finale of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]''. He appeared as a [[keytar]] player named Demetri.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1078392/fullcredits#cast "The Flight of the Conchords" The Third Conchord (2007) - Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
He also had a part in the movie ''[[The Rocker (film)|The Rocker]]'' (2008) starring [[Rainn Wilson]]. Martin played the part of the videographer when the band in the movie was making their first [[music video]].

In 2009, he hosted and starred in his own television show called ''[[Important Things With Demetri Martin]]'' on Comedy Central. Later in June, it was announced his show had been renewed for a second season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/another-important-season-for-demetri-martin/ | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Another 'Important' Season for Demetri Martin | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff | date=June 2, 2009 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> The second season premiered, again on Comedy Central, on February 4, 2010. Martin has stated that ''Important Things'' will not return for a third season.
Prior to completing work on his second season, Martin starred in the [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' (2009), directed by [[Ang Lee]], which premiered at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]]. In the film Martin plays [[Elliot Tiber]], a [[closeted]] gay artist who has given up his ambitions in the city to move upstate and help his old-world Jewish family run their [[Catskill Mountains]] motel. The film is based on the book written by Tiber.
On April 25, 2011, Martin released his first book, titled ''This Is a Book''. 
Martin played a small role in the 2011 film ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]''.

Martin sold his movie concept ''Will'' to [[DreamWorks]], and is expected to play a key supporting role.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940457.html?categoryid=1948&cs=1 | title = 'Will' Fills D'Works Bill | date = March 27, 2006 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first = Chris | last = Gardner | accessdate = February 24, 2007 }}</ref> He will play the lead in the film ''Moon People'', a pitch that he sold to [[Columbia Pictures]].
He also signed a blind script deal with [[CBS]] in October 2010 to produce, write, and star in his own television series.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://demetrimartin.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/demetri-martin-to-star-write-produce-own-cbs-show/ | title = Demetri Martin To Star, Write, Produce Own CBS Show | date = October 19, 2010 }}</ref> After CBS was shown the pilot for the series, they decided not to air it.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://demetrimartin.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/demetri-martins-cbs-show-not-happening/ | title = Demetri Martin's CBS Show Not Happening | date = March 11, 2011 }}</ref>

== Comedic style ==
Martin is known for being an unconventional stand-up comic.  He uses [[one-line joke|one-liners]] and drawings on a "large pad", as well as accompanying his jokes with music on either [[guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[piano]], [[Piano Keys|keyboard]], [[glockenspiel]], toy bells, [[ukulele]], or [[tambourine]], sometimes all at once.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/1.1370449-1.1370449 |title= Comedian Demetri Martin's 'Important' TV Show Fails at Funny |work=[[The Daily Texan]] |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He has cited comedian [[Steven Wright]] as an important influence (both use deadpan one-liners in their acts) and he is also a fan of [[Bill Cosby]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.gelfmagazine.com/mt/archives/word_games.html | title = Word Games | date = May 5, 2005 | work = [[Gelf (magazine)|Gelf]] | first = Keith | last = Huang | accessdate = February 24, 2007 }}</ref>

Martin plays instruments on stage and has music playing in the background of his performances as a way of preventing any editing of his performances to better fit for television.<ref>http://www.nerdist.com/2012/12/nerdist-podcast-demetri-martin/</ref>

== Personal life ==
According to a July 2011 interview on the podcast ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'', Martin had a short-lived marriage with Jen, a woman he knew from high school. They began dating after high school, and got married when he was at [[NYU Law School]] and she was attending [[NYU Medical School]].<ref name="WTFPod"/> This relationship was further analyzed in his one-man show ''Spiral Bound''.

On June 1, 2012, Martin married his long-time girlfriend Rachael Beame in [[Santa Monica, California]]. He had moved to Santa Monica in 2009.<ref>''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', [http://www.adamcarolla.com/ACPBlog/2011/04/13/demetri-martin/ 13 April 2011, 20 minute mark]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/21/entertainment/ca-hot-martin21|title=Demetri Martin, star of 'Taking Woodstock'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 April 2011|quote=Martin, who recently moved from Brooklyn to West Los Angeles|first=John|last=Horn|date=June 21, 2009}}</ref>
