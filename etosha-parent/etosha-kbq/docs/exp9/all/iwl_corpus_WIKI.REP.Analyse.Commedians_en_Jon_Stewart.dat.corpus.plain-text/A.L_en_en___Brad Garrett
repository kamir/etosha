At Ancestry.com</ref> April 14, 1960) is an American actor and [[stand-up comedian]]. He has appeared in numerous television and film roles.

Garrett was initially successful as a stand-up comedian in the early 1980s. Taking advantage of that success in the late 1980s, Garrett began appearing in television and film, in minor and guest roles. His first major role was [[Robert Barone]] on the [[CBS]] series ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. The series debuted September 13, 1996 and ran for nine seasons.

Garrett's film roles include ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'', ''[[Stuart Little 2]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Garfield (film)|Garfield]]'', ''[[The Amateurs]]'', ''[[The Pacifier]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum (film)|Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Tangled]]'', and ''[[Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil]]''. Garrett also played the leading role of Eddie Stark on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[['Til Death]]'' from 2006 to 2010.

Garrett has won three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, with three other nominations. Garrett is still prominent within stand-up comedy and is also a professional poker player. Garrett is recognized for his height and deep, gravelly voice.

==Early life==
Garrett was born in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], [[California]]. He is the son of Barbara ([[married and maiden names|née]] Colton), a homemaker, and Albert "Al" Gerstenfeld, a [[hearing aid]] salesman.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Brad-Garrett.html Brad Garrett Biography (1960-)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He is Jewish, but he celebrates Christmas and Hanukkah<ref>http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2014/apr/10/its-good-times-brad-garrett/ It’s good times for Brad Garrett as his Comedy Club turns 2 at MGM Grand</ref><ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/065/000064870/</ref> and has two older brothers, Jeff and Paul. He attended [[George Ellery Hale Middle School]] in Woodland Hills and graduated from [[El Camino Real High School]] in Woodland Hills.

==Career==
In one of his earliest public appearances, Garrett can be seen as the menacing palace guard on the back cover of the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] album ''[[Discovery (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Discovery]]'' released in 1979. In this, Garrett is seen dressed in middle-eastern traditional clothing, akin to that of the fictional character Aladdin, drawing his [[scimitar]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Garrett started out at various improv clubs in Los Angeles, including [[The Improv]] in [[Hollywood]] and The Ice House in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. In 1984, he became the first $100,000 grand champion winner in the comedy category of the TV show ''[[Star Search]]''. This led to his first appearance, at age 23, on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', making him one of the youngest comedians ever to perform on the show. His appearance with Carson brought Garrett a lot of national attention, and soon he was appearing as an opening act for such headliners as [[Diana Ross]] and [[Liza Minnelli]].  He also opened in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for [[Frank Sinatra]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], the [[Beach Boys]], the [[Righteous Brothers]] and [[Julio Iglesias]].

After achieving a strong measure of success with stand-up comedy, Garrett decided to change gears and try his luck with performing on TV.  He was the voice of wrestling legend [[Hulk Hogan]] for the cartoon series ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n Wrestling]]'', He was featured on ''[[Family Feud]]'' during [[Ray Combs]]'s tenure in a "Funny Men vs. Funny Women Week" during November [[sweeps]]. He also appeared for a week on the game show ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'' in 1987. He also appeared on [[Hollywood Squares]] including a memorable moment when he impersonated [[Bill Cosby]] during a question about [[Jell-o]]. He then appeared in the short-lived summer comedy ''[[First Impressions (TV series)|First Impressions]]'' ([[CBS]], 1988), in which he was a divorced father who makes a living doing impressions, in a one-time spot as a bank loan officer on ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), and ''The Pursuit of Happiness'' ([[NBC]], 1995–96), in which he was the hero's gay best friend. Though prior to these roles, Garrett had also had a minor part on ''[[Transformers series|Transformers]]'', voicing the [[Decepticon]] base [[Trypticon]] in season three and as an ill-fated thug in ''[[Suicide Kings]]''. He soon won the role of [[Ray Romano]]'s brother Robert Barone on the long-running family-oriented comedy hit ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.  Garrett has also made an appearance on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' playing a [[hitman]] who attempts to kill [[Will Smith]]'s character.

Garrett's distinctive deep voice has landed him prolific work as a [[voice actor]], such as on ''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]'', ''[[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper]]'', ''[[Project Geeker]]'', ''Steven Spielberg Presents: [[Toonsylvania]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Vikings]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'',  and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].

He won the fifth season championship of ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]'', and played in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 [[World Series of Poker]]. Garrett was hoping to do a spin-off with his character Robert Barone from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' when the show ended its nine-year run in 2005, but he withdrew in October 2005 due to inaction from CBS that led to a number of the writers from ''Raymond'' leaving and taking other jobs.

In 2005, Garrett appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] playing Murray the Cop in the revival of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple]]'' with [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Matthew Broderick]].
