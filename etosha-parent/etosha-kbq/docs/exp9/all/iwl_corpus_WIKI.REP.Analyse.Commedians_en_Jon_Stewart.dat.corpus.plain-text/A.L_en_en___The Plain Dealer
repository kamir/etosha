==History and ownership==
[[File:Cleveland Plain Dealer 8-07-1945.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of the Cleveland Plain Dealer dated August 7, 1945 featuring the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].]]
The newspaper was established in 1842, less than 50 years after [[Moses Cleaveland]] landed on the banks of the [[Cuyahoga River]] in [[The Flats]], and is currently owned by [[Advance Publications]] (Newhouse Newspapers).<ref name="advance">Columbia Journalism Review (2005). [http://www.cjr.org/tools/owners/advance.asp] Who Owns What. Retrieved June 5, 2006.</ref> The Plain Dealer Publishing Company is under the direction of Virginia Wang (general manager). The paper employs over 700 people.

The newspaper was sold on March 1, 1967, to [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.|S.I. Newhouse]]'s newspaper chain, and has been under the control of the Newhouse family ever since.<ref name="cityonasee1">Cleveland: Confused City on a See-saw (Electronic Edition). [http://clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/] Philip W. Porter, 1976. Pages 234â€“235.</ref> The paper was previously held by the trusts of the Holden estate, and operated as The Plain Dealer Publishing Company, part of the Forest City Publishing Company, which also published the ''[[Cleveland News]]'' until its purchase and subsequent closing by its major competitor, the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'', owned by the [[E.W. Scripps Company]], in 1960.<ref name="cityonasee2">Cleveland: Confused City on a See-saw (Electronic Edition). [http://clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/] Philip W. Porter, 1976. Page 10.</ref>

On December 18, 2005, ''The Plain Dealer'' ceased publication of its weekly ''Sunday Magazine'', which had been published uninterrupted for over 85 years.<ref name="sunday">"The Plain Dealer kills off Sunday Magazine", ''Editor and Publisher'', December 2005.</ref> The demise of the paper's ''Sunday Magazine'' was attributed to the high cost of newsprint and declining revenue, and the PD reassigned the editors, designers and reporters to other areas of the newspaper. It also assured readers that the stories that would formerly have appeared in the Sunday Magazine would be integrated into other areas of the paper.

On the morning of Wednesday, July 31, 2013, nearly a third of the newsroom staff was eliminated through [[layoff]]s and voluntary resignations. The ''Plain Dealer'''s corporate owner, New York-based [[Advance Publications Inc.]], a private company run by the heirs of S.I. Newhouse, under a strategy to focus more on online news delivery, had been cutting staff and publication schedules. Previously, in December 2012, under an agreement with the [[Newspaper Guild]], nearly two dozen union newsroom staff voluntarily accepted [[severance package]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/12/the_plain_dealer_and_its_news.html|title=Newspaper Guild endorses labor agreement with The Plain Dealer|author=Robert L.

On August 5, 2013, the Northeast Ohio Media Group launched and The Plain Dealer Publishing Company was formed. Northeast Ohio Media Group operates cleveland.com and Sun News and is responsible for all multimedia ad sales and marketing for The Plain Dealer, Sun News and cleveland.com. It also provides content to The Plain Dealer, cleveland.com and Sun News. The Plain Dealer Publishing Company provides content and publishes in print seven days a week.  The company also provides production, distribution, finance, information technology, accounting and other support services for the Plain Dealer Publishing Co. and Northeast Ohio Media Group.

==Bureaus==

==Design==
''The Plain Dealer'' employs a modern styling of a daily newspaper, but has undergone dramatic stylistic changes in the past few years to update the print edition's look. Weekday and Sunday editions regularly feature front pages with content boxes on the upper part of the page detailing news inside. The physical width of the paper has been reduced in recent years as well, a trend throughout the newspaper industry.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Political leanings===
''The Plain Dealer'' has been criticized by liberal columnists for staking out generally conservative positions on its editorial page, despite serving a predominantly Democratic readership base. In 2004, the editorial board voted to endorse [[John Kerry]]; after publisher Alex Machaskee overruled it, ordering the board to write an endorsement of [[George W. Bush]], editorial page editor Brent Larkin managed to talk Machaskee into withholding an endorsement.<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/27/cleveland_plain_dealer/index.html The power of a publisher].</ref> The news coverage is generally more neutral, with national and international news often culled from [[wire service]]s, including the ''[[New York Times]]'.''

The paper had also been accused of being too soft on Sen. [[George Voinovich]], and in the 2004 election cycle for the U.S. Senate, not providing fair coverage, if any, to Voinovich's opponent, State Sen. [[Eric Fingerhut]], a Democrat.<ref name="voinovich">[http://www.coolcleveland.com/index.php?n=Main.ThePlainDealerAndItsLoveAffairWithGeorgeVoinovich Cool Cleveland on PD and Voinovich.]</ref>

===Publishing concealed weapons permit holder lists===
In 2005, the newspaper twice published lists of concealed weapon permit holders from the 5 counties around Cleveland. Editor Doug Clifton defended the paper's decision, sparking a feud with a pro-carry lobbyist group. State Senator Steve Austria called it abuse of the media access privilege, saying publishing these names would threaten the safety of the men and women who obtain these permits. An Ohio [[gun rights]] group then published Clifton's home address and phone number.<ref name="ohiocc">[http://www.ohioccw.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2273 Ohio for Concealed Carry]</ref>

==="Held stories" controversy===
{{wikinews|Newspaper refuses to utilize leaked documents in article}}
''The Plain Dealer'' made national headlines in the summer of 2005, when editor Douglas Clifton announced that the newspaper was withholding two stories "of profound importance" after [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' were ordered to reveal confidential sources who had provided information on [[Valerie Plame|Joseph Wilson's wife]] being a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants and a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as "having no backbone" and he himself even admitted that people could refer to him as "chickenshit." Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. "Talking isn't an option and jail is too high a price to pay", Clifton said.<ref name="clifton2">"WHO HAS YOUR BACK? Journalism in the Corporate Age", ''Columbia Journalism Review'', September 2005.</ref>

The controversy ended when the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'', an [[alternative weekly]] Cleveland newspaper, published a similar story, thus allowing ''The Plain Dealer'' to print the withheld story. The story turned out to be on former [[List of mayors of Cleveland, Ohio|Mayor]] [[Michael White (politician)|Michael R. White]]'s federal corruption probe, which was leaked to the press by an attorney on the case. The second withheld story has yet to be revealed.<ref name="held">"Keeping reporters' notes out of court", The American Editor, August 2005 â€“ October 2005, FREEDOM OF INFORMATION. Pam Luecke, Author.</ref>

===Music critic sidelined===
On September 17, 2008, ''The Plain Dealer'''s music critic of 16 years, [[Donald Rosenberg]], was told by the paper's editor, Susan Goldberg, that he would no longer be covering performances of the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. Rosenberg had been critical of orchestral performances under its conductor [[Franz Welser-MÃ¶st]], although his reviews of Welser-MÃ¶st as a conductor of operas had been positive. Terrance C. Z. Egger, president and publisher of the paper, is also on the orchestra's board.<ref name=DR>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/arts/music/25crit.html?_r=1&ref=music&pagewanted=print|title=Music Critic vs. Maestro: One Loses His Beat|accessdate=2008-09-28|last=Wakin|first=Daniel J.|date=September 25, 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Shirley Strickland Saffold===
In March 2010, the Plain Dealer reported that approximately 80 comments had been posted to articles on its web site by an account registered to the email address of Shirley Strickland Saffold, a judge sitting on the [[Cuyahoga County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]].<ref name="PD20100327">{{cite news|last=McCarty|first=James F. |title=Anonymous online comments are linked to the personal e-mail account of Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Shirley Strickland Saffold|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/03/post_258.html|accessdate=January 4, 2011|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=March 27, 2010}}</ref> Several of the comments, posted under the pseudonym ''lawmiss'', discussed matters that were or had been before the judge.<ref name="PD20100327"/> Although the judge's 23-year-old daughter Sydney Saffold took responsibility for the postings, the paper was able to use a public records request and determine that the exact times and dates of some of the postings corresponded to the times that the corresponding articles were being viewed on the judge's court-issued computer.<ref name="PD20100327"/> The revelation led one attorney, who had been criticized in the postings, to request the judge [[recuse]] herself from a [[homicide]] trial in which he represented the defendant.<ref name="PD20100408"/> [[Ohio Supreme Court]] Acting Chief Justice [[Paul E.

===Removal of debate video===
In October 2014, the Northeast Ohio Media Group hosted the three Ohio candidates for governor in what would be their only joint appearance. The debate was held before the NEOMG's editorial board (which also serves as the editorial board of The Plain Dealer) and NEOMG reporters. Incumbent Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, showed up at the debate without a tie and largely ignored his main rival, Democrat Ed FitzGerald. Kasich went so far as to refuse to admit he could hear the questions of FitzGerald, who was sitting next to him, and instead insisted that a reporter repeat them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gomez|first1=Henry|title="Gov. John Kasich ignores Ed FitzGerald in their only meeting of election season: 5 observations"|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/10/gov_john_kasich_ignores_ed_fit.html|publisher=Northeast Ohio Media Group|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>

During the debate, a video camera was positioned eight feet in front of the candidates. The resulting video was posted on cleveland.com. A few days later, however, it was removed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mismas|first1=Joseph|title="PD Pulls Video Of Kasich Refusing To Answer Editorial Board Questions"|url=http://www.plunderbund.com/2014/10/27/pd-pulls-video-of-kasich-refusing-to-answer-editorial-board-questions/|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> When other sites posted copies of the now-deleted video, the NEOMG sent letters threatening legal action.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cushing|first1=Tim|title="Cleveland Plain Dealer Owner Demands Takedown Of Unflattering Video Featuring Candidate It Endorsed In Governor's Race"|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141028/16323728972/cleveland-plain-dealer-owner-demands-takedown-unflattering-video-featuring-candidate-it-endorsed-governors-race.shtml|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> The NEOMG's actions drew coverage from other media organizations<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Tom|title="PD silent on debate video"|url=http://www.sanduskyregister.com/opinion/tom-jackson/6350031|publisher=Sandusky Register|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Castele|first1=Nick|title=The Only Video of Kasich and FitzGerald Debating Isnâ€™t Online Anymore.

At 7 a.m. on the day after the election, which Kasich -- endorsed by the NEOMG -- won easily, the news organization posted online an explanation of events written by its reader representative. The column cited this as Quinn's explanation: Shortly after the video was posted, the Kasich campaign contacted him and said it had not been aware a video would be posted online. Quinn eventually decided that his failure to explicitly explain the presence of a video camera was unfair. Further, "I thought that if I stated my reasons, the obvious next step would be people going to the candidates and asking them if they had any objection to putting the video back up," Quinn is quoted as saying. "That would mean my error could put people into an uncomfortable situation."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Diadiun|first1=Ted|title="Here's why Chris Quinn took down the interview video of John Kasich, Ed FitzGerald and Anita Rios: Ted Diadiun "|url=http://www.cleveland.com/readers/index.ssf/2014/11/heres_why_chris_quinn_took_dow.html|publisher=Northeast Ohio Media Group|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref> The explanation left at least some critics unsatisfied.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zimon|first1=Jill Miller|title=NEOMG Finally Publishes Its Explanation, Apology For Chris Quinnâ€™s Video Removal Decision|url=http://writeslikeshetalks.com/2014/11/05/neomg-finally-publishes-its-explanation-apology-for-chris-quinns-video-removal-decision/|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allard|first1=Sam|title=Finally, Poorly, the NEOMG Explains the Kasich Video Debacle and Chris Quinn's "Error in Judgement"|url=http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2014/11/05/finally-poorly-the-neomg-explains-the-kasich-video-debacle-and-chris-quinns-error-in-judgement|publisher=Cleveland Scene|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>

''The Plain Dealer'' is the major news contributor to cleveland.com, the regional news, event and communication [[web portal|portal]] run by [[Advance Internet]] via Northeast Ohio Media Group. The paper does not operate its own editorial website. Northeast Ohio Media Group runs a separate website for the business side of the newspaper, including advertising. cleveland.com also features news from the [[Sun Newspapers]], which are a group of smaller, weekly, more suburban-oriented newspapers in the Greater Cleveland metro area also owned by Advance Publications. The Sun Newspapers are the largest chain of paid weekly newspapers in the country.

The quality of the site (as well as other [[Advance Internet]] sites) is regularly criticized by the staff, newsroom staff and locals.<ref name="clevemag">[http://www.clevelandmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=586CA122EB394032BD4AA3B686FF03D9&nm=Editorial&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=1578600D80804596A222593669321019&tier=4&id=A45D8D54936842A0BCDAF9B90DCDE003 "The New Dealer", Cleveland Magazine, Jan 2006]</ref>
The website was recently redesigned as a result.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/aboutus/index.ssf?/aboutus/content/relaunch.html "About us â€“ Cleveland.com"]</ref>

===Politifact Ohio===
In July 2010, ''The Plain Dealer'' launched [http://www.politifact.com/ohio/ Politifact Ohio], a website that analyzes issues relevant to Ohio and the greater Cleveland area. The feature was produced in conjunction with its creator, the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''. Four years later, the relationship was ended. Although the operation had generated criticism, the decision to drop it was attributed instead to a desire to keep all content on cleveland.com rather than the separate PolitiFact Ohio site, which remains available as an archive.<ref>{{cite web|title="The Plain Dealer drops PolitiFact, but keeps on factchecking"|url=http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/cleveland_plain_dealer_politifact_factchecking.php?page=all|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>
