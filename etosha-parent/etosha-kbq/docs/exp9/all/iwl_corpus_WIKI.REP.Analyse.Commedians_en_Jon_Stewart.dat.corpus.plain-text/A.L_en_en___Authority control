While in theory any piece of information is amenable to authority control such as personal and corporate names, [[uniform title|uniform titles]], series names, and subjects,<ref name=tws2NovY111/> library cataloguers typically focus on author names and book titles. Subject headings from the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress]] fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort to keep up with these changes and try to bring "structure and order" to the task of helping users find information.<ref name=tws2NovY312/>

==Benefits of authority control==
* ''Better researching''. Authority control helps researchers get a handle on a specific subject with less wasted effort.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> A well-designed digital catalog/database enables a researcher to query a few words of an entry to bring up the already established term or phrase, thus improving accuracy and saving time.<ref name=tws2NovY323/>

* ''Efficiency for cataloguers''. The process of authority control is not only of great help to researchers searching for a particular subject to study, but it can help cataloguers organize information as well. Cataloguers can use authority records when trying to categorize new items, since they can see which records have already been catalogued and can therefore avoid unnecessary work.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/><ref name=tws2NovY877/>
* ''Maximises library resources''.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/>
* ''Easier to maintain the catalog''. It enables cataloguers to detect and correct errors.

==Examples==

===Differing names describe the same subject===
[[File:Princess diana bristol 1987 01.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Princess Diana]] is described in one authority file as "Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961–1997" which is an official heading.]]
Sometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for only one person or subject.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/><ref name = tws2NovY909 />  This can bring confusion since researchers may miss some information. Authority control is used by cataloguers to [[collocation|collocate]] materials that logically belong together but which present themselves differently. Records are used to establish [[uniform title]]s which collocate all versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such versions are issued under different titles. With authority control, one unique preferred name represents all variations and will include different variations, spellings and misspellings, uppercase versus lowercase variants, differing dates, and so forth. For example, in Wikipedia, the subject of [[Princess Diana]] is described by an article [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] as well as numerous other descriptors, but both ''Princess Diana'' and ''Diana, Princess of Wales'' describe the same person; an authority record would choose one title as the preferred one for consistency. In an online library catalog, various entries might look like the following:<ref name=tws2NovY111 />

::#Diana. (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales. (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961–1997 (13)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales 1961–1997 (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961–1997 (2)
::#DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES, 1961–1997. (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales, — Iconography. (2)<ref name=tws2NovY111 />

These different terms describe the same person. Accordingly, authority control reduces these entries to one unique entry or official authorized heading, sometimes termed an ''access point'':

::Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961–1997<ref name=VIAF/>

Generally there are different authority file headings chosen by different national libraries, possibly inviting confusion, but there are different approaches internationally to try to lessen the confusion. One international effort to prevent such confusion is the [[Virtual International Authority File]] which is a collaborative attempt to provide a single heading for a particular subject. It is a way to standardize information from different national libraries such as the [[German National Library]] and the United States [[Library of Congress]]. The idea is to create a single worldwide virtual authority file. For example, the ID for [[Princess Diana]] in the German [[Integrated Authority File|Integrated Authority File (GND)]] is ''118525123'' while the United States Library of Congress uses the term ''Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961-1997'';  other national libraries have other choices. The Virtual International Authority File choice for all of these variations is ''VIAF ID: 107032638''—that is, a common number representing all of these variations.<ref name=VIAF>[http://viaf.org/viaf/107032638/ Virtual International Authority File] records for Princess Diana, retrieved March 12, 2013</ref>

Wikipedia prefers the term [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], but at the bottom of Wikipedia's page about her, there are links to various international cataloguing efforts for reference purposes.

===Same name describes two different subjects===
Sometimes two different authors have been published under the same name.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This can happen if there is a title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title.<ref name=tws2NovYfuf/> This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918–1965 when the person [[Floruit|flourished]], or a brief descriptive epithet. When cataloguers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can [[Word-sense disambiguation|disambiguate]] them using authority control.

==Authority records and files==
A customary way of enforcing authority control in a bibliographic catalog is to set up a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalog. This separate index is often referred to as an "authority file." It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by cataloguers in a given library (or—as is increasingly the case—cataloguing consortium), which cataloguers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings.  As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.<ref name =tws2NovY434 />

While authority files provide information about a particular subject, their primary function is not to provide information but to organize it.<ref name=tws2NovY434>{{cite news | first = Karen | last = Calhoun |title= A Bird's Eye View of Authority Control in Cataloging | newspaper = Cornell University Library |date= June 1998 |url= http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html |accessdate= November 25, 2012}}</ref> They contain enough information to establish that a given author or title is unique, but that is all; irrelevant but interesting information is generally excluded.  Although practices vary internationally, authority records in the English-speaking world generally contain the following information:

* ''Headings'' show the preferred title chosen as the official and authorized version. It is important that the heading be unique; if there is a conflict with an identical heading, then one of the two will have to be chosen:
{{Quote |Since the headings function as access points, making sure that they are distinct and not in conflict with existing entries is important. For example, the English novelist William Collins (1824–89), whose works include the Moonstone and The Woman in White is better known as Wilkie Collins. Cataloguers have to decide which name the public would most likely look under, and whether to use a see also reference to link alternative forms of an individual's name.|Moya K.

* ''Cross references'' are other forms of the name or title that might appear in the catalog and include:
#''see'' references are forms of the name or title that describe the subject but which have been passed over or ''deprecated'' in favor of the authorized heading form
#''see also'' references point to other forms of the name or title that are also authorized. These ''see also'' references generally point to earlier or later forms of a name or title.
* ''Statement(s) of justification'' is a brief account made by the cataloguer about particular information sources used to determine both authorized and deprecated forms. Sometimes this means citing the title and publication date of the source, the location of the name or title on that source, and the form in which it appears on that source.

[[File:An example of an authority record.png|thumb|right|450px]]
For example, the Irish writer [[Brian O'Nolan]], who lived from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many [[pen name]]s such as Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form—"O'Brien, Flann, 1911–1966"—as the official heading.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://authorities.loc.gov/ | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Authorities files | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}; the original record has been abbreviated for clarity.</ref>  The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading ''O'Brien, Flann, 1911–1966'' is the form of the name that the [[Library of Congress]] chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with ''Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911–1966'' are the ''see'' references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: "See O'Brien, Flann, 1911–1966." There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: "Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911–1966" has an extra ''C'' inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized ''C'' shows the correct root word while the preceding ''g'' indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. ''See also'' references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with ''His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939.'' constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds'', whereas the author's other ''noms de plume'' appeared on later publications.

==Access control==
The act of choosing a single authorized heading to represent all forms of a name is quite often a difficult and complex task, considering that any given individual may have legally changed their name or used a variety of legal names in the course of their lifetime, as well as a variety of nicknames, pen names, stage names or other alternative names. It may be particularly difficult to choose a single authorized heading for individuals whose various names have controversial political or social connotations, when the choice of authorized heading may be seen as endorsement of the associated political or social ideology.

An alternative to using authorized headings is the idea of ''access control,'' where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.<ref>Note: See Linda Barnhart's [http://worldcat.org/arcviewer/1/OCC/2003/06/20/0000003520/viewer/file81.html ''Access Control Records: Prospects and Challenges''] from the 1996 OCLC conference entitled ;  "Authority Control in the 21st Century " For more information.</ref>

==Authority control and cooperative cataloging==
Before the advent of digital [[online public access catalog]]s and the Internet, creating and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the authority files of the different libraries. For the early part of library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.

As libraries became more attuned to the needs of researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as [[OCLC]] and [[RLIN]] in the [[United States]], in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.

In the United States, the primary organization for maintaining cataloging standards with respect to authority work operates under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]], and is known as the Name Authority Cooperative Program, or NACO Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/ |title=NACO Home: NACO (Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC), Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref>

==Standards==
There are various standards using different acronyms.

'''Standards for authority metadata''':
