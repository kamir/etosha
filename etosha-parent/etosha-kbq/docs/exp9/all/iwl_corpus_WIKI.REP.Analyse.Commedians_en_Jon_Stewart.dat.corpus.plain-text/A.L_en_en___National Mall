==History==
[[File:National Mall circa 1901 - Washington DC.jpg|thumb|350 px|left|Looking east from the top of the Washington Monument towards the National Mall and the United States Capitol  in the summer of 1901.

{{See also|History of Washington, D.C.}}

In his 1791 plan for the future city of Washington, D.C., [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]] envisioned a garden-lined "grand avenue" approximately 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in length
and {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide, in an area that would lie between the Capitol building and an equestrian statue of [[George Washington]] to be placed directly south of the [[White House]] (see [[L'Enfant Plan]]).<ref name="National Register Nomination Form">{{cite web |last=Pfanz|first=Donald C.|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/66000031.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: National Mall|publisher=National Park Service|date=1981-02-11|accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref name=Sherald>{{cite book|last=Sherald|first=James L|url=http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Documents/Studies/ElmsoftheMonuCore_HistandMgmtPlan_122009.pdf|title=Elms for the Monumental Core: History and Management Plan|id=Natural Resource Report NPS/NCR/NRR--2009/001|place=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Center for Urban Ecology, National Capital Region, [[National Park Service]]|pages=2–5|date=December 2009|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref><ref>(1) {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm|title=Map 1: The L'Enfant Plan for Washington|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2009-10-27}}<br>(2) L'Enfant identified himself as "Peter Charles L'Enfant" during most of his life, while residing in the United States.  He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ...."] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the United States, [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, "Pierre Charles L'Enfant". (See: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C.) The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as ''[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]'' and as '' [http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]'' on its website.

The Washington Monument stands near the planned site of its namesake's equestrian statue.

In 1901, the [[McMillan Plan|McMillan Commission]]'s plan, which was partially inspired by the [[City Beautiful Movement]] and which purportedly extended L'Enfant's plan, called for a radical redesign of the Mall that would replace its greenhouses, gardens, trees, and commercial/industrial facilities with an open space.<ref name=Sherald /><ref name=Hanlon /><ref name=Moore>{{Citation| last=Moore|first=Charles (ed)|title=The Improvement Of The Park System Of The District of Columbia: Report by the United States Congress: Senate Committee on the District of Columbia and District of Columbia Park Commission|place=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=1902|chapter=The Mall|pages=43–46|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ob7PAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|id=Fifty-Seventh Congress, First Session, Senate Report No. 166}}.

In subsequent years, the vision of the McMillan plan was generally followed with the planting of American elms and the layout of four boulevards down the Mall, two on either side of a wide [[lawn]].<ref name="Mall History" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/National_mall_%28east%29_satellite_image.jpg|title=United States Geological Survey satellite imagery of National Mall|date=April 26, 2002|publisher=[[Wikimedia Commons]]|accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref><ref>Satellite imagery of the National Mall in Google maps ''in'' {{coord|38.89|-77.023611|scale:6500|name=National Mall}}</ref>  In accordance with a plan that it completed in 1976, the NPS converted the two innermost boulevards (Washington and Adams Drives) into gravel walking paths.<ref name="Mall History"/> The two outermost boulevards (Jefferson Drive [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|Southwest]] (SW) and Madison Drive [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]] (NW)) remain paved and open to vehicular traffic.<ref name="Mall History"/>

==Purposes==
The National Park Service states that the purposes of the National Mall are to:
* Provide a monumental, dignified, and symbolic setting for the governmental structures, museums and national memorials as first delineated by the L'Enfant plan and further outlined in the McMillan plan.
* Maintain and provide for the use of the National Mall with its public promenades as a completed work of civic art, a designed historic landscape providing extraordinary vistas to symbols of the nation.
* Maintain National Mall commemorative works (memorials, monuments, statues, sites, gardens) that honor presidential legacies, distinguished public figures, ideas, events, and military and civilian sacrifices and contributions.
* Forever retain the West Potomac Park section of the National Mall as a public park for recreation and enjoyment of the people.
* Maintain the National Mall in the heart of the nation's capital as a stage for national events and a preeminent national civic space for public gatherings because it is here that the constitutional rights of speech and peaceful assembly find their fullest expression.
* Maintain the National Mall as an area free of commercial advertising while retaining the ability to recognize sponsors.<ref name="foundation statement"/>

The population of American elm trees planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas in accordance with the McMillan Plan has remained intact for the past 70 years because of disease management and immediate tree replacement.  [[Dutch elm disease]] (DED) first appeared on the Mall during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS has used a number of methods to control this [[fungus|fungal]] epidemic, including [[sanitation]],  [[pruning]], injecting trees with [[fungicide]], replanting with DED-resistant American elm [[cultivar]]s and combatting the disease's local insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the smaller European elm [[bark beetle]] ([[Scolytus]] multistriatus), by trapping and by spraying with [[insecticide]]s. [[Soil compaction]] and root damage by crowds and construction projects also adversely affect the elms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherald|first=James L|url=http://www.nps.gov/nationalmallplan/Documents/Studies/ElmsoftheMonuCore_HistandMgmtPlan_122009.pdf|title=Elms for the Monumental Core: History and Management Plan|id=Natural Resource Report NPS/NCR/NRR--2009/001|place=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Center for Urban Ecology, National Capital Region, [[National Park Service]]|date=December 2009|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>

==Other attractions nearby==
{{See also|Category:Visitor attractions in Washington, D.C.}}

Other attractions within walking distance of the National Mall proper include the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[United States Supreme Court Building]] east of the Capitol; the [[White House]] (on a line directly north of the Washington Monument), the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], the [[Freedom Forum]]'s [[Newseum]], the [[Old Post Office Pavilion]], the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], [[Ford's Theatre]], and the [[Albert Einstein Memorial]] to the north; the [[National Postal Museum]] and [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] to the northeast; and the Jefferson Memorial, the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]], the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial]], the [[George Mason Memorial]], the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], and the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] to the south.

==Usage==
The National Mall, in combination with the other attractions in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], makes the nation's capital city one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.  However, it has uses other than as a tourist focal point.

===Protests and rallies===
{{See also|List of protest marches on Washington, D.C.}}

The National Mall's status as a wide, open expanse at the heart of the capital makes it an attractive site for protests and rallies of all types.  One notable example is the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], a [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]] for [[African American]] [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights]], at which [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.

The largest officially recorded rally was the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam War Moratorium Rally]] on October 15, 1969. However, in 1995, the NPS issued a crowd estimate for the [[Million Man March]] with which an organizer of the event, [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], disagreed.<ref name=Leef>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Leef|last2=Melillo|first2=Wendy|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/21925324.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+13%2C+1996&author=Leef+Smith%3BWendy+Melillo&desc=If+It%27s+Crowd+Size+You+Want%2C+Park+Service+Says+Count+It+Out%3B+Congress+Told+Agency+to+Stop%2C+Official+Says|title=If It's Crowd Size You Want, Park Service Says Count It Out; Congress Told Agency to Stop, Official Says|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|page=A.34|date=1996-10-13|accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref>  The next year, a committee of the [[104th United States Congress]] provided no funds for NPS crowd counting activities in Washington, D.C. when it prepared legislation making 1997 appropriations for the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].<ref name=Leef /><ref>{{cite web|last=Regula|first=Ralph, Committee on Appropriations|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_reports&docid=f:hr625.104.pdf|title=House of Representatives Report 104-625:  Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 1997, to accompany H.R. 3662|page=28|quote=The Committee has provided no funding for crowd counting activities associated with gatherings held on federal property in Washington, D.C.

===Presidential inaugurations===

{{Main|United States presidential inauguration}}

During [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]]s, people without official tickets gather at the National Mall.  Normally, the Mall between [[7th Street (Washington, D.C.)|7th]] and 14th Streets NW is used as a staging ground for the parade.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nikita|last=Stewart|title=Entire Mall To Be Open To Public |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403719.html?hpid=topnews |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2008-12-05|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>  On December 4, 2008, the Presidential Inaugural Committee (see [[United States presidential inauguration#Organizers]]) announced that "for the first time, the entire length of the National Mall will be opened to the public so that more people than ever before will be able to witness the swearing-in of the [[President of the United States|President]] from a vantage point in sight of the Capitol."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081207144648/http://www.pic2009.org/pressroom/entry/open_inauguration/ |title=National Mall Will Be Open to the Public on Inauguration Day|accessdate=2011-03-14|date=2008-12-04 |archivedate=2008-12-07}}</ref> The Committee made this arrangement because of the massive attendance – projected to be as many as 2 million people – that it expected for the [[first inauguration of Barack Obama]] on January 20, 2009. Despite the arrangement, a throng of people seeking access to the event climbed and then removed temporary protective fences around the Smithsonian's Mary Livingston Ripley Garden, six blocks from the site at which Obama took his inaugural oath. Hordes then trampled the garden's vegetation and elevated plant beds when entering and leaving the event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/25/AR2009032500925.html|title=For Smithsonian, a Sad Souvenir of the Inauguration |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-23|last=Higgins|first=Adrian|work=[[The Washington Post|The&nbsp;Washington Post]] |page=H.1}}</ref> Others could not find a way to enter the Mall in time to view the ceremony.

===Other events and recreational activities===
The National Mall has long served as a spot for jogging, picnics, and light recreation for the [[Demographics of Washington, D.C.|Washington population]].  The Smithsonian Carousel, located on the Mall in front of the Arts and Industry Building, is a popular attraction that operates seasonally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/guides/english.htm|title=Welcome to the Smithsonian|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=August 2006|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>  The [[carousel]] was built by the Allan Herschell Company and arrived at [[Gwynn Oak Park]] near [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in 1947.

In 1983, one of his cabinet members canceled a fourth of July Beach Boys concert on federal grounds in Washington, D.C., fearing the band would bring the wrong element to the capital. The move looked like crackbrained politics on every level -- the administration appeared painfully out of touch (banning the Beach Boys?), and the official who canned the show didn't even realize that the band was publicly down with the Reagans.<br>This was political theater of the absurd, and it was therefore a place where Dead Kennedys felt exceedingly at home. The San Francisco foursome took action, putting together a punk-rock festival on the Mall, the expanse of lawn stretching between the Washington Monument and the Capitol building. They were goading the government to try to stop them. Instead, thousands of punks filled the grounds that day, and skinny DKs frontman [[Jello Biafra]] greeted them by comparing the Monument to a giant hooded Klansman.

The Plan proposed a number of changes to the Mall.  The NPS would construct at the east end of the Mall a wide expanse of paved surface in Union Square to accommodate demonstrations and other events by reducing the size of the Capitol Reflecting Pool or by replacing the pool with a fountain or other small water feature.
