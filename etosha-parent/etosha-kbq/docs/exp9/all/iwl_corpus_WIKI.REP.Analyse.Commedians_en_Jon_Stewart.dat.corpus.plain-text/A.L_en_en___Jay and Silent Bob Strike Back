'''''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''''' is a 2001 American [[comedy film]] directed, written by, and starring [[Kevin Smith]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]], the fifth to be set in his [[View Askewniverse]], a growing collection of characters and settings that developed out of his cult favorite ''[[Clerks]]''. It focuses on the [[Jay and Silent Bob|two eponymous characters]], played respectively by [[Jason Mewes]] and Smith.

The film features a large number of cameo appearances by famous actors and directors.

The title and logo for ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' are direct references to ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''.

Smith originally intended for it to be the last film set in his [[View Askewniverse]], or to feature [[Jay and Silent Bob]], and thus features many characters from the previous View Askew films. Five years later, Smith reconsidered and decided to continue the series with ''[[Clerks II]]'', resurrecting Jay and Silent Bob in supporting roles. Smith has also decided to make another sequel to ''Clerks'', and as of 2015 is in development.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=December 2014}}
After getting a [[restraining order]] from [[Randal Graves]] ([[Clerks]]) for [[Illegal drug trade|selling drugs]] outside the Quick Stop, [[Jay and Silent Bob]] find out from [[Brodie Bruce]] ([[Mallrats]]) that ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]'', the comic book based on their likenesses, has been adapted into a film in production by [[Miramax Films]]. In response, the two see Holden McNeil (''[[Chasing Amy]]''), the co-writer of ''Bluntman and Chronic'' for the royalties of the film. However, Holden tells Jay and Silent Bob that he sold his part of the creative and publishing rights of the comic over to his former friend Banky Edwards. Upon learning of the film, as well as the negative reaction it has received so far on the Internet,<ref>http://asitecalledfred.com/old/story.html</ref> the two set out on a quest to [[Hollywood]], to prevent the film from being made and tainting their image, or at the very least receive the money from the royalties owed to them.

On the way, they befriend an animal liberation group, consisting of four women: Justice, Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy; and one man, Brent, who they had picked up for the cause. It is revealed that the organization is a front; Brent is a patsy, intended as a diversion by freeing an animal from a testing laboratory while the girls rob a diamond depository nearby. Jay tricks Brent and throws him out of the van in order to get closer to Justice, with whom he is smitten. Justice, who becomes close to Jay and Silent Bob (particularly the former), reluctantly accepts the two as the new patsies.

While the girls are robbing the diamond depository they accidentally set off the alarm, prompting them to break the glass and steal the diamonds.  While this is going on Jay and Silent Bob free the animals and take an [[orangutan]] named Suzanne with them. They escape outside to see the police arriving and the van exploding, which they believe has killed the girls.

Jay then takes the orangutan with him as a memorial to Justice.  Quickly afterwards, Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly (whose name is taken from the three characters in the TV show [[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]: Marshal, Will and Holly) shows up at the scene. Blinded to the diamond heist, he claims to have jurisdiction because of the large number of animals that escaped. He learns that all the animals have been recovered except for the orangutan. The officers then find and watch footage of a video Sissy recorded of Jay making remarks about "the [[Clitoris|clit]]", claiming to be "the Clit commander." The literature accompanying the tape says that "Clit" is an acronym for ''Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers''. Willenholly blindly finds this as an act of [[terrorism]] and calls for police support to hunt down what he considered "the two most dangerous men on the planet."

When the officers later have the trio cornered inside a diner and threaten to open fire, Jay and Silent Bob dress the orangutan as a child and walk out, claiming that they want to get their "son" out of the danger zone. Willenholly, thinking about the political repercussions of arresting a [[gay]] couple, decides to let them leave, but he quickly realizes his mistake and resumes the chase. When they jump into a sewer system, only Willenholly himself follows them while the other police officers, led by the Sheriff, leave him, and he is soon tricked into jumping off of a dam.

Having escaped the law, Jay and Silent Bob once again return to their quest to reach Hollywood, only to have Suzanne taken by a Hollywood animal acting agency car.  Now on a quest to get their ape back and to clear their names, the two once again embark to Hollywood.

On their arrival in Hollywood, the two find themselves in the background of an ''[[E! News]]'' newscast (ironically about their threat against Miramax on the Internet) that Justice is watching. While Justice takes the diamonds and goes to Hollywood to set things right, Marshal Willenholly learns of their mission to reach Hollywood and leaves to find them.

After a long chase with studio security and reclaiming Suzanne from a fictional [[Scream (film series)|''Scream 4'']] in production, Jay and Silent Bob end up in [[Jason Biggs]] and [[James Van Der Beek]]'s dressing room, where they quickly realize that these are the actors that will play the roles of Bluntman and Chronic. Suzanne beats both of them up effortlessly and Jay and Silent Bob assume the roles of their characters. Production staff throw them on stage with [[Racism|racist]] director Chaka Luther King, and they must engage in a duel with [[Mark Hamill]] playing a comic book supervillain called Cocknocker. Eventually Willenholly arrives to capture Jay and Silent Bob, but Justice arrives to save them. Justice admits that the CLIT organization was not real and that the two were used as a diversion she, Missy, Sissy and Chrissy, were stealing jewels. As the rest of jewel thieves arrive, a climactic final battle ensues, after which Jay and Silent Bob get their royalties to the film from Banky, and Justice turns herself and her former team in to Willenholly in exchange for a shorter sentence and letting Jay and Silent Bob go.

The film ends with Jay and Silent Bob spending their royalty to locate everyone who expressed negative opinions on the internet about the movie and characters, ranging from kids to clergy, and traveling to their towns to beat them up. The scene then cuts to everyone leaving a movie theater, having just watched the Bluntman and Chronic movie and expressing negative reception: [[Hooper X]] calls the film a "one 90-minute-long gay joke." Jay and Silent Bob, with Justice and Willenholly, then go across the street to enjoy a performance from [[Morris Day]] and [[The Time (band)|The Time]].

After the credits, God closes the [[View Askewniverse]] book.{{ref|a}}

==MPAA rating and GLAAD controversy==
In August 2001, three weeks prior to release, the film came under fire from the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD), for its "overwhelmingly [[Homophobia|homophobic]] tone",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b41964_glaad_strikes_back_silent_bob.html |title=GLAAD Strikes Back at 'Silent Bob' |last1=Armstrong |first1=Mark |date=August 2, 2001 |work= |publisher=[[E!|eonline.com]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}</ref> which included an abundance of gay jokes and characters excessively using the term "gay" to mean something derogatory. The scenes deemed particularly offensive included Jay's vehement refusal of giving oral sex to a male driver when hitchhiking, and Jay chastising Silent Bob for being willing to perform fellatio on him to get the security guard to let them go. Following an advance screening of the film, former GLAAD media director Scott Seomin asked Smith to make a $10,000 donation to the [[Matthew Shepard Foundation]], as well as to include a reference to GLAAD's cause in the ending credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,169884,00.html |title=GLAAD, Don't Get Mad |last= Ascher-Walsh |first=Rebecca |date=August 3, 2001 |work= |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viewaskew.com/newboard/messages287/521.html |title=Some bad, bad news concerning me and GLAAD |last1=Smith |first1=Kevin |last2= |date=July 31, 2001 |work= |publisher=viewaskew.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}</ref>

On the bonus disc of the two-disc DVD, Smith explains in the on-camera intros of the deleted scenes that several scenes had to be cut from the theatrical release, due to the film initially receiving an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA]]. He also mentions in the audio commentary of the feature film that it took three submissions to the MPAA for the film to earn an R-rating.

==Notes==
{{note|a}}According to Ethan Alter of [[Film Journal International]], Smith did not intend to make [[Clerks II|another View Askewniverse film]] upon completion of ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', but only decided to do so several years later, following the unsuccessful release of ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]''.<ref name="fci">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002877011|title=CLERKS II|last=Alter|first=Ethan|work=[[Film Journal International]]|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref>
