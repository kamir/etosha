'''John Irving Bloom''' (born January 27, 1953), who uses the pseudonym '''Joe Bob Briggs''', is a [[print syndication|syndicated]] American [[film criticism|film critic]], writer and comic performer.

==Early years==
Bloom was born in [[Dallas]], Texas, the son of Thelma Louise (née Berry) and Rudolph Lewis Bloom.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/5/Joe-Bob-Briggs.html Joe Bob Briggs Biography (1953–)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was raised in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas, and attended [[Vanderbilt University]] on a sports-writing scholarship. He began his writing career at ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' and ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]''. While a movie reviewer at the Herald, he created the humorous persona of "Joe Bob Briggs" to review [[exploitation films]] and other [[genre film]]s.

==Persona==
Briggs's acting persona is that of an unapologetic [[redneck]] Texan with an avowed love of the drive-in theatre.  He specializes in humorous but appreciative reviews of [[b-movie]]s and [[cult film]]s, which he calls ''[[Drive-in theater|drive-in movies]]'' (as distinguished from "indoor bullstuff").  In addition to his usual parody of urbane, high-brow movie criticism, his columns characteristically include colorful tales of woman-troubles and high-spirited brushes with the law, tales which inevitably conclude with his rush to catch a movie at a local drive-in, usually with female companionship. The reviews typically end with a brief rating of the "high points" of the movie in question, including the types of action (represented by nouns naming objects used in fight scenes suffixed with ''-[[Kung fu (term)|fu]]''), the number of bodies, number of female [[breast]]s bared, the notional number of pints of blood spilled, and for appropriately untoward movies a "vomit meter". A typical such concluding paragraph would be, "No dead bodies. One hundred seventeen breasts. Multiple aardvarking.  Lap dancing. Cage dancing. Convenience-store dancing. Blindfold aardvarking. Blind-MAN aardvarking. Lesbo Fu. Pool cue-fu. Drive-In Academy Award nominations for Tane McClure. Joe Bob says check it out."  ("Aardvarking" is one of many euphemisms Briggs employs in reference to [[sexual intercourse]].<ref>[http://www.joebobbriggs.com/list/aardvarklist.txt Aardvarking List]</ref><ref>[http://www.joebobbriggs.com/drivein/1994/saturdaynightspecial.htm JOE BOB'S ADVICE TO THE HOPELESS – "Dear Joe Bob, Why does the term "aardvarking" mean sexual intercourse..."]</ref>)

Originally, Brigg's film reviews were limited to pictures shown at local drive-ins. Later, after [[Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive In|a tongue-in-cheek 'battle' with his own convictions]], he also began reviewing films released on VHS and DVD.

===Reaction to redevelopment of 42nd Street===
During the early 1980s when the [[City of New York]] was in the planning stages of renovating and redeveloping its run-down [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], [[Times Square]] area, which included closing many [[grindhouses]] showing [[B-movies]] on double and triple bills around the clock, as well as many [[adult movie theater|porn theatres]], Joe Bob expressed great opposition. He encouraged a "Postcard Fu" campaign, i.e., encouraging film fans to write to officials and pressure them into saving "the one place in New York City you could see a decent drive-in movie." He felt that 42nd Street movie houses rightfully belonged to all Americans and should be preserved as places where "[[Charles Bronson]] can be seen thirty feet high, as God intended".<ref>{{cite book |title=Ghosts of 42nd Street: A History of America's Most Infamous Block |last=Bianco |first=Anthony |authorlink= |author2= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-688-17089-7 |oclc= |page=230 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===One man show===
''An Evening with Joe Bob Briggs'', Joe Bob's one-man show, debuted in [[Cleveland]] in July 1985. Later re-titled ''Joe Bob Dead in Concert'', it evolved into a theatrical piece involving story- telling, comedy and music that was performed in more than fifty venues over the next two years, including Caroline's in New York, convention centers, theaters, music clubs, comedy clubs, and regular engagements at Wolfgang's and the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco.

==Television==
In 1986, as a result of the stage show, Joe Bob was asked to be a guest host on ''Drive-In Theater'', a late- night B-movie show on [[The Movie Channel]] (TMC), sister network of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Briggs went over so well that he was eventually signed to a long-term contract. ''Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater'' became the network's highest-rated show and ran for almost ten years, and was twice nominated for the industry's Cable ACE Award. He appeared on some 50 talk shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' (twice) and ''[[Larry King Live]]''. He was also a commentator for a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV news magazine for two seasons.

''Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater'' ended when TMC changed its format in early 1996. He was off the air for only four months before joining the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network, where he hosted ''[[MonsterVision]]'' for four years. That show ended in July 2000, when TNT likewise changed format. In 2011, the most definitive account of the ''MonsterVision'' series (including interviews with Briggs and series mailgirl Honey Gregory) appeared on the cult movie website, Mondo Video.  In the late '90s he also spent two seasons as a commentator on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' (under his given name John Bloom), with a recurring segment called "God stuff" beginning on the 2nd ever episode in 1996. He starred in [[Frank Henenlotter]]'s documentary  ''[[Herschell Gordon Lewis]] – Godfather of Gore''.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38584/motion-picture-purgatory-herschell-gordon-lewis-godfather-gore Motion Picture Purgatory: Herschell Gordon Lewis – Godfather of Gore]</ref>

==Writing==
During these TV years, Briggs remained active as a writer, working as a contributing editor to the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'', freelancing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', the ''[[Village Voice]]'', and ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''. He was the regular humor columnist and theater critic at the ''[[National Review]]'', and he published five books of satire--''Joe Bob Goes to the Drive-In'', ''A Guide to Western Civilization, or My Story'', ''Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive-In'', ''The Cosmic Wisdom of Joe Bob Briggs'', and ''Iron Joe Bob'', his parody of the [[men's movement]]. He also wrote and performed in special shows for Fox and Showtime, and collaborated with veteran comedy writer [[Norman Steinberg]] on an [[NBC]] sitcom that remains unproduced. His two syndicated newspaper columns--"Joe Bob Goes to the Drive-In" and "Joe Bob's America"—were picked up by the ''[[New York Times]]'' Syndicate in the '90s, and he continued to write both until putting the columns on hiatus in 1998. For one year he wrote a humorous sex advice column in ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. In November 2000 he started writing the "Drive-In" column again, this time for [[United Press International]], along with a second column, "The Vegas Guy", which chronicles Joe Bob's weekly forays into the casinos of America.  In 2003, Briggs delivered ''Profoundly Disturbing: Shocking Movies That Changed History''.

In 1998, Bloom retired from writing newspaper reviews, only to return two years later due to popular demand<ref>[http://www.joebobbriggs.com/drivein/2000/jbreturns.htm Joe Bob Goes to the Drive-In – November 14, 2000<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and continue his column as Joe Bob with UPI.  Bloom has also appeared on television as a host of [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''[[MonsterVision]]'' [[horror movie]] marathons, and has an internet website, The Joe Bob Report,<ref>[http://www.joebobbriggs.com/ The Joe Bob Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with collections of movie reviews and other articles.

Briggs was president of the [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] of Dallas, Texas, a non-denominational, non-profit public foundation that serves as a religious [[wikt:watchdog|watchdog]] group and publishes ''[[The Door (satirical Christian magazine)|The Door]]'', a Christian satire magazine, of which Briggs was a regular columnist and investigative reporter. Some of the efforts of Bloom's religious watchdog reporting and satire were featured (under his given name John Bloom) in [[The Daily Show recurring elements#God Stuff|God Stuff]], a regular segment in the first two seasons of ''[[The Daily Show]]''. In addition, some of his writing can be seen in ''Choice: The Best of [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', a compilation of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine's work over the past four decades.  As of [[Halloween]] 2007, Briggs is Head Online Doorkeeper of the [[Wittenburg Door]] (the misspelling is deliberate), a magazine of religious satire.

===Books===
Joe Bob Briggs' movie reviews are collected in the now out-of-print books ''[[Joe Bob Goes to the Drive In]]'' and ''[[Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive In]]''. His most recent books, ''Profoundly Erotic: Sexy Movies that Changed History'' and ''Profoundly Disturbing: Shocking Movies that Changed History'', contain all-new material. Recently, Briggs has contributed [[Audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentaries]] to DVDs released by Media Blasters and Elite Entertainment including ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'', ''[[The Double-D Avenger]]'', ''[[Michael Findlay|Blood Sisters]]'', ''[[Warlock Moon]]'', ''[[Samurai Cop]]'', ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'', and several [[Ray Dennis Steckler]] films including ''[[The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies]]'' and ''Blood Shack''.

Joe Bob Briggs appeared as himself in the 2008 novel ''Bad Moon Rising'' by [[Jonathan Maberry]]. Joe Bob is one of several real-world horror celebrities who are in the fictional town of Pine Deep when monsters attack. Other celebrities include [[Tom Savini]], [[Jim O'Rear]], [[Brinke Stevens]], [[Ken Foree]], [[Stephen Susco]], [[Debbie Rochon]], [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] and blues man [[Mem Shannon]].<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/books/article/interview-with-jonathan-maberry-part-two BC Books Interviews Author Jonathan Maberry]</ref><ref>Maberry, Jonathan.

Under his given name, John Bloom, he also co-wrote the nonfiction book ''Evidence of Love: The [[Candy Montgomery]] Story'' (1984). The book recounts the 1980 [[Wylie, Texas|Wylie]], Texas, murder case in which Montgomery killed her ex-lover's wife, Betty Gore, by striking her a total of 41 times with an [[ax]] and whose highly publicized trial ended in an unexpected<ref name="weiss">Jeffrey Weiss.

In 1990 the book was made into CBS television movie [[A Killing in a Small Town]] starring [[Barbara Hershey]]

==Controversy==
In 1985, "Briggs" wrote a column about the "We are the world" video, in which he wrote a mocking description of starving African children, and made derogatory comments about the American Negro College Fund. The resulting controversy ended Bloom's position at the ''Dallas Times Herald'', though his syndicated column merely changed distributors.<ref>[http://www.acmewebpages.com/joebob/feature1-4.html "Joe Bob in Bloom", Dallas Observer]</ref><ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1986/12/22/1986_12_22_073_TNY_CARDS_000346894 Calvin Trillin, American Chronicles, “THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JOE BOB BRIGGS, SO FAR,” The New Yorker, December 22, 1986, p. 73]</ref>
