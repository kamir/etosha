The '''United States presidential election of 1988''' was the 51st quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 8, 1988. Incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination, and chose Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]] as his running mate. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] nominated [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]] of [[Massachusetts]], with Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] of [[Texas]] as his running mate.

Bush capitalized on a good economy, a stable international stage, and on President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s popularity, running an aggressive campaign. Meanwhile, Dukakis' campaign suffered from several miscues, including failure to defend against Bush's attacks. This allowed Bush to win with a substantial margin of the popular vote, while winning the Electoral College by a landslide. Since the 1988 election, no candidate has managed to equal or surpass Bush's number of electoral votes won or popular vote percentage.

This election marked the third consecutive presidential victory for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and the first time that a party had won more than two consecutive presidential elections since the Democrats won all five elections from [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]] to [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]].

In the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] the Democrats had nominated [[Walter Mondale]], a traditional [[New Deal]]-type liberal as their candidate. When Mondale was defeated in a landslide, party leaders became eager to find a new approach to get away from the 1980 and 1984 debacles. After Bush's image was affected by his involvement on the [[Iran-Contra]] scandal much more than Reagan's, and after the Democrats won back control of the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] in the 1986 congressional elections, the party's leaders felt more optimistic about having a closer race with the GOP in 1988, although probabilities from winning the presidency were still marginal with the current climate of prosperity.

One goal of the party was to find a new, fresh candidate who could move beyond the traditional New Deal-Great Society ideas of the past and offer a new image of the Democrats to the public. To this end party leaders tried to recruit the [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]], [[Mario Cuomo]], to be a candidate. Cuomo had impressed many Democrats with his stirring keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention, and they believed that he would be a strong candidate.<ref>Steve Neal for the Chicago Tribune.

J. Dionne Jr. |date=May 3, 1987 |work=The New York Times, pg. SM28}}</ref>

However, questions and rumors about possible extramarital affairs and about past debts dogged Hart's campaign.<ref name=NYTimesFall/> One of the great myths is that Senator Hart challenged the media to "put a tail" on him and that reporters then took him up on that challenge. In fact, Hart had told reporters from ''[[The New York Times]]'' who questioned him about these rumors that, if they followed him around, they would "be bored". However, in a separate investigation, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' had received an anonymous tip from a friend of [[Donna Rice]] that Rice was involved with Hart. It was only after Hart had been discovered that the Herald reporters found Hart's quote in a pre-print of the ''[[New York Times]]'' magazine.<ref name="HeraldSummary">{{cite news |date=May 10, 1987 |title=The Gary Hart Story: How It Happened. |url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/Hart/hartarticle.html |newspaper=The Miami Herald}}</ref> After the ''Herald'''s findings were publicized, many other media outlets picked up the story and Hart's ratings in the polls plummeted. On May 8, 1987, a week after the Donna Rice story broke, Hart dropped out of the race.<ref name=NYTimesFall>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/09/us/courting-danger-the-fall-of-gary-hart.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Courting Danger: The Fall Of Gary Hart |work=The New York Times |date=May 9, 1987 |first1=David |last1=Johnston |first2=Wayne |last2=King |first3=Jon |last3=Nordheimer}}</ref>  His campaign chair, Representative [[Patricia Schroeder]] tested the waters for about four months after Hart's withdrawal, but decided in September 1987 that she would not run.<ref>Warren Weaver, Jr. for the New York Times.

Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts had been considered a potential candidate, but he ruled himself out of the 1988 campaign in the fall of 1985. Two other politicians mentioned as possible candidates, both from Arkansas, didn't join the race: Senator [[Dale Bumpers]] and [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] (and future President) [[Bill Clinton]]. (Clinton said in 2007 he changed his mind the day before he was to announce a run, he felt that he wasn't ready for the Presidency in 1988, and that he would wait until 1992 or 1996 before trying.){{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[Joe Biden]]'s campaign also ended in controversy after the Delaware Senator was accused of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] a speech by [[Neil Kinnock]], then-leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD1531F931A2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden's Debate Finale: An Echo From Abroad | author=Dowd, Maureen | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=September 12, 1987 | authorlink= Maureen Dowd}}</ref> Though Biden had correctly credited the original author in all speeches but one, the one where he failed to make mention of the originator was caught on video and parlayed into a political hit piece by the Dukakis campaign.<ref>''Washington Post'': [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/biden.htm Joseph Biden's Plagiarism; Michael Dukakis's 'Attack Video' – 1988.] 1988.</ref> In the video Biden is filmed repeating a stump speech by Kinnock, with only minor modifications. This would lead him to drop out of the race. Dukakis later revealed that his campaign was responsible for leaking the tape, and two members of his staff resigned. The [[Delaware Supreme Court]]'s Board on Professional Responsibility would later clear Biden of the law school plagiarism charges.<ref>{{cite news | title=Professional Board Clears Biden In Two Allegations of Plagiarism | page=29 | work=The New York Times | date=May 29, 1989 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/29/us/professional-board-clears-biden-in-two-allegations-of-plagiarism.html }}</ref>

[[Al Gore]], a Senator from [[Tennessee]], also chose to run for the nomination. Turning 40 in 1988, he would have been the youngest man ever to contest the Presidency on a major party ticket since William Jennings Bryan in 1896, and the youngest president ever if elected, younger than [[John F. Kennedy]] at election age and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] at age of assumption of office.

====Primaries====
After Hart withdrew from the race, no clear frontrunner emerged before the primaries and caucuses began. The [[Iowa caucus]] was won by [[Dick Gephardt]], who had been sagging heavily in the polls until, three weeks before the vote, he began campaigning as a [[Populism|populist]] and his numbers surged. [[Illinois]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Paul M. Simon]] finished a surprising second, and [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] finished third. In the [[New Hampshire primary]], Dukakis came in first place, Gephardt fell to second, and Simon came in third. In an effort to weaken Gephardt's candidacy, both Dukakis and Tennessee Senator [[Al Gore]] ran negative television ads against Gephardt. The ads convinced the [[United Auto Workers]], which had endorsed Gephardt, to withdraw their endorsement; this crippled Gephardt, as he relied heavily on the support of labor unions.

In the [[Super Tuesday]] races, Dukakis won six primaries, to Gore's five, [[Jesse Jackson]] five and Gephardt one, with Gore and Jackson splitting the Southern states. The next week, Simon won Illinois with Jesse Jackson finishing second. 1988 remains the race with the most candidates winning primaries since the McGovern reforms of 1971. Jackson captured 6.9 million votes and won 11 contests: seven primaries ([[Alabama]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Virginia]]) and four caucuses ([[Delaware]], [[Michigan]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Vermont]]). Jackson also scored March victories in [[Alaska]]'s caucuses and Texas's local conventions, despite losing the Texas primary. Briefly, after he won 55% of the vote in the Michigan Democratic caucus he had more pledged delegates than all the other candidates.

However, Jackson's campaign suffered a significant setback less than two weeks later when he was defeated handily in the [[Wisconsin]] primary by Michael Dukakis. Dukakis's win in New York and then in [[Pennsylvania]] effectively ended Jackson's hopes for the nomination.

====Democratic Convention====
The [[1988 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Party Convention]] was held in [[Atlanta]], Georgia from July 18–21. Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]] placed Dukakis's name in nomination, but the nominating speech lasted for so long that some delegates began booing to get him to finish, and he received great cheering, when he said, "In closing...".<ref>{{cite news | title=It Was the Speech That Ate Atlanta| first=Marylouise | last=Oates | work=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-22/news/vw-7609_1_speech-time|date=July 22, 1988|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref>

The most memorable speech given at the Democratic Convention was by [[Texas State Treasurer]] [[Ann Richards]], who two years later was elected the [[Governor of Texas|state governor]]. Richards uttered the famous line: "Poor George [H.W. Bush], he can't help it, he was born with a silver foot in his mouth."

With only Jackson remaining as an active candidate to oppose Dukakis, the tally for president was:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+The Balloting
|-
!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!
|-
![[Michael S. Dukakis]] !!2,876.25!! [[Lloyd M. Bentsen]] !!4,162
|-
![[Jesse L. Jackson]]!!1,218.5!! !!
|-
![[Richard H. Stallings]] !!3!! !!

![[Joe Biden]] !!2!! !!
|-
![[Richard A. Gephardt]] !!2!! !!
|-
![[Gary W. Hart]] !!1!! !!
|-
![[Lloyd M. Bentsen]] !!1!! !!
|}

[[Jesse Jackson]]'s supporters said that since their candidate had finished in second place, he was entitled to the vice-presidential spot. Dukakis disagreed, and instead selected Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] of Texas. Bentsen's selection led many in the media to dub the ticket as the "Boston-Austin" axis, and to compare it to the more famous pairing of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 1960 presidential campaign. Like Dukakis and Bentsen, Kennedy had been from Massachusetts and Johnson from Texas.

Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] had the support of President [[Ronald Reagan]], and pledged to continue Reagan's policies, but also pledged a "kinder and gentler nation" in an attempt to win over some more moderate voters. The duties he was delegated to during Reagan's second term (mostly because of the President's advanced age, Reagan turned 78 just after he left office) gave him an unusually high quantity of experience for a Vice-President.

Bush unexpectedly came in third in the [[Iowa caucus]], which he had won in 1980, behind Dole and Robertson. Dole was also leading in the polls of the [[New Hampshire primary]], and the Bush camp responded by running television commercials portraying Dole as a tax raiser, while Governor [[John H. Sununu]] campaigned for Bush. Dole did nothing to counter these ads and Bush won, thereby gaining crucial momentum, or what he called "Big Mo".<ref>{{cite news | title=Even with win, Bush seen to be vulnerable | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=February 18, 1988 | first=John | last=Dillin | page=1}}</ref>

Once the multiple-state primaries such as Super Tuesday began, Bush's organizational strength and fund raising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his. The Republican Party convention was held in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bush was nominated unanimously. Bush selected U.S. Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]] as his running mate.

In his acceptance speech, Bush made an energetic pledge, "[[Read my lips: No new taxes]]", a comment that would come to haunt him constantly as the economy collapsed in mid-to-late 1989, which cost him the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 election]].

==General election==

===Campaign===
During the election, the Bush campaign sought to portray Governor Dukakis as a "[[Massachusetts liberal]]" who was unreasonably left-wing. Dukakis was attacked for such positions as opposing mandatory recitation of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] in schools, and being a "card carrying member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]" (a statement Dukakis made himself early in the primary campaign). Dukakis responded by saying that he was a "proud liberal" and that the phrase should not be a bad word in America. Bush (Yale '48) derided Dukakis ([[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] '55) for having "foreign-policy views born in [[Harvard Yard]]'s [[boutique]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarpley.net/bush22.htm|title=George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography: Chapter XXII Bush Takes The Presidency|author=Webster G.

Bush explained that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and [[elitism]]," and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent "a philosophical enclave" and not a statement about class.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dowd |first=Maureen |date=June 11, 1988 |title=Bush Traces How Yale Differs From Harvard |newspaper=The New York Times |page=10 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/11/us/bush-traces-how-yale-differs-from-harvard.html |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> Columnist [[Russell Baker]] opined that "Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard.

The Dukakis camp tried to tie Bush to some of the recent scandals of the Reagan administration, such as [[Iran-Contra affair]], approaching that he had almost the same degree of power as Reagan.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Image:Michael Dukakis in tank.jpg|thumb|Michael Dukakis on tank]]
Governor Dukakis attempted to quell criticism that he was ignorant on military matters by staging a [[Michael Dukakis tank photograph|photo op]] in which he rode in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank outside a [[General Dynamics]] plant in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Dukakis spells out Soviet policy | work=The Boston Globe | first=Ben, Jr. | last=Bradlee |author2=Fred Kaplan | authorlink2=Fred Kaplan (journalist) | date=September 14, 1988}}</ref> The move ended up being a massive public relations blunder, with many mocking Dukakis's appearance as he stuck his smiling, helmeted head out one of the tank's hatches to wave to the crowd. Footage of Dukakis was used by the Bush campaign as evidence he would not make a good commander-in-chief, and "Dukakis in the tank" — or the "Snoopy Incident" — remains shorthand for backfired public relations outings.<ref>{{cite news | title=Rat-Tat-Tatting | first=William | last=Safire | work=The New York Times | page=A35 | date=September 15, 1988 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/15/opinion/essay-rat-tat-tatting.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Talks of Lasers and Bombers |first=Maureen | last=Dowd | work=The New York Times | page=8 | date=September 17, 1988 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/17/us/bush-talks-of-lasers-and-bombers.html }}</ref>

[[Image:Dukakis1988rally.jpg|thumb|Michael Dukakis at a campaign rally at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion on the eve of the 1988 election.]]

One reason for Bush's choice of running mate, Senator [[Dan Quayle]], was to appeal to a younger generation of Americans identified with the "Reagan Revolution". Quayle's good looks were praised by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]]: "I can't believe a guy that handsome wouldn't have some impact."<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush taps Quayle for VP | first=Jeff | last=Mapes | work=The Oregonian | page=A01 | date=August 17, 1988}}</ref> Quayle was not a seasoned politician, however, and made a number of embarrassing statements. The Dukakis team attacked Quayle's credentials, saying he was dangerously inexperienced to be first-in-line to the presidency.<ref>{{cite news | title=Quayle Reflects Badly on Bush, Dukakis Asserts | work=The New York Times | first=Robin | last=Toner | date=October 7, 1988 | page=B6 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/07/us/quayle-reflects-badly-on-bush-dukakis-asserts.html }}</ref>

During the Vice Presidential debate, Quayle attempted to dispel such allegations by comparing his experience with that of former Senator [[John F. Kennedy]], who had also been a young political rookie when running for the presidency. Quayle said, "I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency." (Kennedy had served fourteen years in Congress to Quayle's twelve). Dukakis's running mate, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], responded, "Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. [[Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy]]."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/george-bush/videos/youre-no-jack-kennedy| title=You're No Jack Kennedy Video| work=The History Channel| publisher=A&E Television Networks| accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

Quayle responded, "That was really uncalled for, Senator", to which Bentsen said, "You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator, and I'm one who knew him well. And frankly I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken."

Quayle's reaction to Bentsen's comment was played and replayed by the Democrats in subsequent television ads as an announcer intoned, "Quayle: just a heartbeat away." Despite much press about the Kennedy comments, this did not reduce the Bush-Quayle lead in the polls. Quayle had sought to use the debate to criticize Dukakis as too liberal rather than go point for point with the more seasoned Bentsen. Bentsen's attempts to defend Dukakis received little recognition, with greater attention on the Kennedy comparison.

During the course of the campaign, Dukakis fired his deputy field director [[Donna Brazile]] after she spread rumors that Bush had an affair with his assistant Jennifer Fitzgerald.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-07-04/living/17434097_1_pots-in-american-politics-campaign-manager-john-kerry | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joshunda | last=Sanders | title=State's Dems still hope for a bit of suspense / A contested primary is viewed as a plus for party | date=July 4, 2004}}</ref> (The relationship of George H.W.

Dukakis was badly hurt by the Republican "Willie Horton",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1988/willie-horton |title=Commercials - 1988 - Willie Horton |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> "[[Revolving Door (television advertisement)|Revolving Door]]", and "Boston Harbor"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1988/harbor |title=Commercials - 1988 - Harbor |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> campaign ads, the latter of which attacked the governor's failure to clean up environmental pollution in the harbor. Dukakis was a supporter of a state prison furlough program, which had begun before he was governor. The program had resulted in the release (furlough) of convicted murderer [[Willie Horton]], who then committed a rape and assault in Maryland. As Governor, Dukakis had vetoed a 1976 plan to bar inmates convicted of first-degree murder from the furlough program. The program was abolished by the state legislature in April 1988 after public outcry over the Willie Horton case.

A number of false rumors about Dukakis were reported in the media, including the claim by Idaho Republican Senator [[Steve Symms]] that Dukakis's wife [[Kitty Dukakis|Kitty]] had burned an American flag to protest the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&dat=19880826&id=mo5TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cYYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4819,6853908|title=Kitty Dukakis denies flag burning protest|date=August 26, 1988|work=The Bulletin|location=Bend, OR|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref> as well as the claim that Dukakis himself had been treated for a mental illness.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reagan Remark Spurs Dukakis Health Report|author=Lauter, David|date = August 4, 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-04/news/mn-10203_1_mental-health|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}</ref> [[Lee Atwater]] was accused of having floated these rumors.<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 26, 1988 |title=Story on Mrs. Dukakis Is Denied by Campaign |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/26/us/story-on-mrs-dukakis-is-denied-by-campaign.html}}</ref>

Although Dukakis did well in the first presidential debate, Bush seemed to score a triumph in the second debate, with a [[Gallup Poll]] giving him a 49–43 lead.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Edge Is Holding In Survey | work=The New York Times | date=October 23, 1988 | page=24 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/us/bush-edge-is-holding-in-survey.html }}</ref> Before the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and spent much of the day in bed. His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being intellectually cold. The most memorable moment came when reporter [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] asked Dukakis whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered. Dukakis's answer discussed the statistical ineffectiveness of capital punishment. Several commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue, but many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the normal emotions one would expect of a person asked about a loved one's rape and death.<ref>{{cite news | title=Editors on Dukakis: Down, but not out | work=The Boston Globe | date=October 19, 1988 | first=Paul | last=Hirshson | page=29}}</ref> [[Tom Brokaw]] of NBC reported on his October 14 newscast: "The consensus tonight is that Vice President George Bush won last night's debate and made it all the harder for Governor Michael Dukakis to catch and pass him in the 25 days remaining. In all of the Friday morning quarterbacking, there was common agreement that Dukakis failed to seize the debate and make it his night."

In the November 8 election, Bush won a majority of the popular vote and a lopsided majority (40) of states in the Electoral College.

Bush performed very strongly among suburban voters, perhaps owing to his campaign themes of law and order, punctuated by his criticisms of the Massachusetts furlough program. This was a boon in several swing states. In Illinois, Bush won 69% in [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] and 63% out of [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]], suburban areas which adjoin Chicago's Cook County. In [[Pennsylvania]], Bush swept the group of suburban counties that surround [[Philadelphia]], including Bucks, Delaware, Chester, and Montgomery. Bush also won most of the counties in [[Maryland]], perhaps fallout from the fact that Willie Horton committed his infamous criminal acts there. [[New Jersey]], known at the time for its many suburban voters and its moderate Republicanism, went easily for Bush. Bush also gained victory for attacking Dukakis's [[furlough]] program he had while he was Governor of Massachusetts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multied.com/elections/1988.html |title=Election of 1988 |publisher=Multied.com |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> though Dukakis still maintained popularity in Massachusetts.

In contrast to the suburbs, Bush's percentage of votes in rural counties was significantly below the support they gave Reagan in 1980 and 1984. In [[Illinois]], Bush lost a number of downstate counties that previously went for Reagan. He lost the state of [[Iowa]] by a surprisingly wide margin, losing counties all across the state even in traditionally Republican areas. The rural state of [[West Virginia]] remained narrowly in the Democratic column. Bush also performed weaker in the northern counties of [[Missouri]], narrowly winning the state. In three typically solid Republican states, [[Kansas]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Montana]], the vote was much closer than usual. The farm states had fared poorly since the recession of the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, and Dukakis was the beneficiary of these agricultural problems.

Bush's greatest area of strength was in the South, where he won most states by wide margins. He also performed very well in the Northeast, winning [[Maine]] (where he had a residence), [[New Hampshire]] (at the time a Republican stronghold), [[Vermont]] (at the time a bastion of moderate Republicanism), and [[Connecticut]] (where his father had been a senator). Bush lost New York by a margin of just over 4 percent. He also won [[Delaware]], at the time a swing state. Despite the presence of Lloyd Bentsen on the Democratic ticket (and other Texans getting prominent roles at the Democratic convention), Bush won the Lone Star State by a convincing margin. He lost the Pacific northwestern states but kept California in the Republican column for the sixth straight time, albeit very narrowly. That would be the last time a Republican candidate won California in a presidential election.

Although his victory was not a landslide in the popular vote (though it was substantial), Bush in 1988 was the last Republican to date to carry certain states which have not voted for [[blue state|a Republican since]], such as [[Vermont]], [[Maine]], [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Michigan]], [[Illinois]], and [[California]]. Neither his victory percentage (53.4%) nor his total electoral votes (426) have been surpassed in any subsequent presidential election. ([[Barack Obama]] came closest in the former with 52.9% in [[United States Presidential election, 2008|2008]], and [[Bill Clinton]] closest in the latter with 379 electoral votes in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]]). Bush was the last candidate to get a majority of the popular vote until his son [[George W. Bush]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]. This was the last election to date in which a Republican presidential nominee won a majority of Northern electoral votes.
