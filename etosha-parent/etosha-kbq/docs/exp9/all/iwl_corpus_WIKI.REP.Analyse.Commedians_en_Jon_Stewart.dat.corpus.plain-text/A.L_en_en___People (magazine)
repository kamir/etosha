''People'' is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming the "World's Most Beautiful," "Best & Worst Dressed" and "Sexiest Man Alive". The magazine's headquarters are in New York and it maintains editorial bureaus in Los Angeles and in London. For economic reasons it closed bureaus in [[Austin]], [[Miami]], and [[Chicago]] in 2006.<ref name="variety" /><ref name="twp" />

==History==
The concept for ''People'' has been attributed to [[Andrew Heiskell]], Time Inc.'s chief executive officer at the time and the former publisher of the weekly [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. (Dick) Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder tapes]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. (Dick) Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.

Stolley characterized the magazine as "getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premiere edition of March 4, 1974 featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the movie ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name="variety" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).
           
The core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers: Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.

In 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Español]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the slain [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm "Grad Named Head of ''People en Español''"]. Tufts University. February 29, 2004.</ref> Although the original idea was that Spanish-language translations of articles from the English magazine would comprise half the content, ''People en Español'' over time came to have entirely original content.

In 2002, ''People'' introduced ''People Stylewatch'', a title focusing on celebrity style, [[fashion]], and beauty &ndash; a newsstand extension of its Stylewatch column. Due to its success, the frequency of ''People Stylewatch'' was increased to 10 times per year in 2007.

In Australia, the localized version of ''People'' is titled ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]'' because of a pre-existing [[lad's mag]] published under the title ''[[People (Australian magazine)|People]]''. The international edition of ''People'' has been published in Greece since 2010.

On July 26, 2013, Outlook Group announced that it was closing down the Indian edition of ''People'', which began publication in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestmediainfo.com/2013/07/outlook-to-close-down-international-titles-people-geo-and-marie-claire/ |title=Outlook to close down international titles - People, Geo and Marie Claire |publisher=Best Media Info |date=July 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Nikhil Pahwa |url=http://www.medianama.com/2013/07/223-on-the-state-of-the-magazine-industry-in-india-outlook-shuts-three-magazines/ |title=On The State Of The Magazine Industry In India; Outlook Shuts Three Magazines |publisher=MediaNama |date=July 29, 2013 |accessdate=March 16, 2014}}</ref>

In 1998, the magazine introduced a version targeted at [[adolescence|teens]], called ''Teen People''. However, on July 27, 2006 the company announced that it would shut down publication of ''Teen People'' immediately. The last issue to be released was scheduled for September 2006.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/business/media/26mag.html?ex=1311566400&en=87ddebb4343277c3&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss "Teen People magazine closes, but website will still continue."] ''New York Times''. July 26, 2006.</ref> Subscribers to this magazine received ''Entertainment Weekly'' for the rest of their issues in exchange. There were numerous reasons cited for the publication shutdown, including a downfall in ad pages, competition from both other teen-oriented magazines and the internet, along with a decrease in circulation numbers.<ref name="medialifemagazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6217.asp |title='&#39;Medialifemagazine.com'&#39;.|publisher=Medialifemagazine.com |date=July 26, 2006|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref> Teenpeople.com was merged into People.com in April 2007. People.com will "carry teen-focused stories that are branded as TeenPeople.com", Mark Golin, the editor of People.com explained, and on the decision to merge the brands he said, "We've got traffic on TeenPeople, People is a larger site, why not combine and have the teen traffic going to one place?"<ref name="mediaweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003570645 |title=TeenPeople.com to Merge Into People.com|publisher=Mediaweek.com|date=April 11, 2007|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref>

===Competition for celebrity photos===
In a July 2006 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article, Janice Min, ''[[Us Weekly]]'' [[editor-in-chief]], blamed ''People'' for the increase in cost to publishers of celebrity photos:
{{Quote|1=They are among the largest spenders of celebrity photos in the industry....One of the first things they ever did, that led to the jacking up of photo prices, was to pay $75,000 to buy pictures of [[Jennifer Lopez]] reading ''Us'' magazine, so ''Us Weekly'' couldn't buy them.

That was the watershed moment that kicked off high photo prices in my mind. I had never seen anything like it. But they saw a competitor come along, and responded. It was a business move, and probably a smart one.<ref name="variety"/>}} 
''People'' reportedly paid $4.1 million for photos of newborn Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, the child of [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brad Pitt]].<ref name="variety" /> The photos set a single-day traffic record for their website, attracting 26.5 million page views.<ref name="variety" />

===Sexiest Man Alive===
The annual feature the "Sexiest Man Alive" is billed as a benchmark of male [[attractiveness]] and typically includes only [[bankable star|famous people]] and [[A list|celebrities]]. It is determined using a procedure similar to the procedure used for [[Time magazine|''Time'']]'s [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]. The origin of the title was a discussion on a planned story on [[Mel Gibson]]. A female editor exclaimed, "Oh my God, he is the sexiest man alive!" And someone else said, "You should use that as a cover line."<ref>Argetsinger, Amy; Roberts, Roxanne. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/19/AR2007111900024.html "Matt Damon??!!! We Demand to Differ!"] ''The Washington Post''. November 19, 2007. Retrieved January 30, 2008</ref>

For the first decade or so, the feature appeared at uneven intervals. Originally awarded in the wintertime, it shifted around the calendar, resulting in gaps as short as seven months and as long as a year and a half (with no selection at all during 1994). Since 1997, the dates have settled between mid-November and early December.

Dates of magazine issues, winners, ages of winners at the time of selection, and pertinent comments are listed below.

As of 2013, [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] and [[Patrick Swayze]] are the only winners to have died since winning. Kennedy and Adam Levine are the only non-actors to have won the award.

===100 Most Beautiful People===
''People''{{'}}s 100 Most Beautiful People is an annual list of 100 people judged to be the most beautiful individuals in the world. Until 2006, it was the 50 Most Beautiful People.

She again was on the cover of the annual issue in 1999, having made the "Most Beautiful" list a record six times during the decade. Pfeiffer is also the first celebrity to have made the cover of the annual issue two times, and the only one to have been on the cover twice during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20128142,00.html |date=May 10, 1999 |work=People|title=The Unstoppable Michelle |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>
