He played [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] through childhood and into high school where he and some friends organized a band they called The N.U.D.E.L.E.S (The New Universal Demonstration for Love, Ecstasy and Sound). Not successful but fun. He discovered acting in his senior year of high school.

==Career==

===Early career===
His first 'job' in Hollywood was providing the opening [[voiceover]] narration for ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974). Larroquette did this as a favor for the film's director [[Tobe Hooper]]. His first series regular role was in the 1970s [[NBC]] program ''[[Black Sheep Squadron(TV series)|Black Sheep Squadron]]'', where he portrayed a [[World War II|WWII]] [[United States Marine Corps]] fighter pilot named 2nd Lt. Bob Anderson. In a 1975 appearance on ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', Larroquette plays Lamont's counterpart in a fictitious sitcom based on Fred and Lamont called "Steinberg and Son". During the filming of ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981), his nose was nearly cut off in an accident. He ran down a hall into a door that was supposed to open but didn't, and his head went through the window in the door.<ref name="20q">"20 Questions," ''Playboy'', April 1990</ref>

===''Night Court'' (1984&ndash;1992)===
[[Image:John Larroquette.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Larroquette attending the [[Emmy Award]]s in 1988]]
Larroquette is best known for his role as [[Dan Fielding]] on ''[[Night Court]]''; the character was initially rather conservative but changed after the show's creator [[Reinhold Weege]] came to learn more about Larroquette's sense of humor.<ref name=Star/><ref name=Broadway/> The role won him [[Emmy Award]]s in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988. In 1989, he asked not to be considered for an Emmy.<ref name="avcrr">[http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/random_roles_john_larroquette/2 AV Club "Random Roles: John Larroquette", June 5, 2008]</ref> His four consecutive wins were, at the time, a record. ''Night Court'' ran on [[NBC]] from 1984 until 1992. Only Larroquette, [[Harry Anderson]] (as Judge Harry Stone), and [[Richard Moll]] (as bailiff Bull Shannon) appeared in every episode of the series. There was talk of spinning Dan Fielding off into his own show, but Larroquette said no to the idea.<ref name=Star/>

===''The John Larroquette Show''===
Instead of a spinoff, Larroquette and [[Don Reo]] developed a show revolving around some of Larroquette's own personal demons; particularly alcoholism. ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'', named by the insistence of NBC, starred Larroquette as the character John Hemingway. The show was lauded by critics and enjoyed a loyal cult following, It ran for three and a half seasons and was by many gauges a success.

From 2004 to 2006, he played the title role in the ''[[McBride (TV series)|McBride]]'' series of American television films. In 2007, he joined the cast of ''[[Boston Legal]]'' playing [[Carl Sack]], a serious, ethical lawyer (the polar opposite of his more famous lawyer character, Dan Fielding). He also guest starred in the drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' where he played a previously catatonic father awakened to try to save his son, and on ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' as veteran spy Roan Montgomery.<ref>[http://www.theinsideronline.com/news/5917/ Celebrity News, Gossip, Photos, Videos and more on The Insider<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has also made two voice roles in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' for Bob Weber, for a lifeguard as well as a man to marry his wife and the boy's [[aunt]] Tiana Weber in another episode.
