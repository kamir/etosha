The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". "[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 1700s, derives its origin from [[Christopher Columbus]]; it appears in the name "[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]".<ref name="Brokenshire1">{{cite book|author=Doug Brokenshire (Stanford University)|title=Washington State Place Names|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7XI52I8zI_AC&pg=PA49|year=1996|publisher=Caxton Press|isbn=978-0-87004-562-2|page=49}}</ref> In non-English languages, the name is frequently the translation of either the "United States" or "United States of America", and colloquially as "America". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.<ref>For example, the U.S. embassy in Spain calls itself the embassy of the "Estados Unidos", literally the words "states" and "united", and also uses the initials "EE.UU.", the doubled letters implying plural use in Spanish [http://spanish.madrid.usembassy.gov/] Elsewhere on the site "Estados Unidos de América" is used [http://spanish.madrid.usembassy.gov/es/educacion/benjamin_2013.html]</ref>

The phrase "United States" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., "the United States are"—including in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865. The singular form—e.g., "the United States is"— became popular after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States".<ref name=zimmer>{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html |author=Zimmer, Benjamin |date=November 24, 2005 |title=Life in These, Uh, This United States |publisher=University of Pennsylvania—Language Log |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.<ref>G. H. Emerson, ''The Universalist Quarterly and General Review'', Vol. 28 (Jan. 1891), p. 49, quoted in Zimmer paper above.</ref>

A citizen of the United States is an "[[Americans|American]]". "United States", "American" and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S.&nbsp;forces"). "[[American (word)|American]]" rarely refers to subjects not connected with the United States.<ref>Wilson, Kenneth G. (1993). ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English''.

In the early days of colonization many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars.<ref>[[#Juergens|Juergens, 2011]], p. 69</ref> At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other.

After [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' [[Columbus's first voyage|first voyage]] to the [[New World]] in 1492, other explorers followed with settlement into the Floridas and the American Southwest.<ref name=Taylor_pp33-34>[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp. 33–34</ref><ref name=Taylor_p72_74>[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp. 72, 74</ref> There were also some [[French colonization of the Americas|French attempts]] to colonize the east coast, and later more successful settlements along the [[Mississippi River]]. Successful [[English overseas possessions|English settlement]] on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims']] [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.<ref>[[#Walton|Walton, 2009]], pp. 29–31</ref> Many settlers were [[English Dissenters|dissenting Christian groups]] who came seeking [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]]. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]] created in 1619, and the [[Mayflower Compact]], signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.<ref>[[#Remini|Remini, 2007]], pp. 2–3</ref><ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson, 1997]], pp. 26–30</ref>

Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. [[Cash crops]] included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.<ref>[[#Walton|Walton, 2009]], chapter 3</ref> Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs.

The United States is a federal union of 50 states. The original 13 states were the successors of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 colonies]] that rebelled against British rule. Early in the country's history, three new states were organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing states: [[Kentucky]] from [[Virginia]]; [[Tennessee]] from [[North Carolina]]; and [[Maine]] from [[Massachusetts]]. Most of the other states have been carved from territories obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. One set of exceptions includes [[Vermont]], [[Texas]], and [[Hawaii]]: each was a well-established independent republic before joining the union. During the [[American Civil War]], [[West Virginia]] broke away from Virginia. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on August 21, 1959.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/10/18/special/story4.html |title='The Goal Was Democracy for All |work= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |author=Borreca, Richard |date=October 18, 1999 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> The states [[Texas v.

Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades, large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/index.html |title=Federal Debt: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> However, these concerns are not universally shared.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lynch |first=David J. |title=Economists See No Crisis With U.S. Debt as Economy Gains |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-22/economists-see-no-crisis-with-u-s-debt-as-economy-gains.html |accessdate=March 25, 2013 |newspaper=Bloomberg |location=New York |date=March 21, 2013}}</ref>

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.<ref>[[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]]. 1999.

[[File:ABC 77 W66 jeh.JPG|thumb|Corporate headquarters of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] in New York City]]
The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS), the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].
Americans are the heaviest television viewers in the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/med_tel_vie-media-television-viewing |title=Media Statistics > Television Viewing by Country |publisher=NationMaster |accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> and the average viewing time continues to rise, reaching five hours a day in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1005003 |title=Broadband and Media Consumption |date=June 7, 2007|publisher=eMarketer |accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref> The four major broadcast [[television network]]s are all commercial entities. Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1004830 |title=TV Fans Spill into Web Sites |date=June 7, 2007|publisher=eMarketer |accessdate = June 10, 2007}}</ref>

In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by [[NPR]] (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) {{As of|2014|09|30|df=US}}, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).<ref>{{cite web|last = Waits | first = Jennifer | title = Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count | website = Radio Survivor | date = October 17, 2014 | accessdate = January 6, 2015 | url = http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/}}</ref>

Well-known newspapers are ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] or [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]], which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's ''[[The Village Voice]]'' or Los Angeles' ''[[LA Weekly]]'', to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book]] began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, [[Superman]], the comic book [[superhero]] of [[DC Comics]], developed into an American icon.<ref>{{cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | authorlink=Les Daniels | year=1998 | title=Superman: The Complete History | page=11 | edition=1st | publisher=[[Titan Books]] | isbn=1-85286-988-7}}</ref> Aside from [[web portal]]s and [[web search engine|search engines]], the most popular websites are [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[Wikipedia]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], and [[Twitter]].<ref name="alexa-topsitesus">{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US |title=Top Sites in United States |year=2014 |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

In Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue behind English, more than 800 publications are published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3newspapers.com/usa/spanish |title=Spanish Newspapers in United States |publisher=W3newspapers |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/usstate/spanish-language-newspapers-usa.htm |title=Spanish Language Newspapers in the USA : Hispanic Newspapers : Periódiscos en Español en los EE.UU |publisher=Onlinenewspapers.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>
