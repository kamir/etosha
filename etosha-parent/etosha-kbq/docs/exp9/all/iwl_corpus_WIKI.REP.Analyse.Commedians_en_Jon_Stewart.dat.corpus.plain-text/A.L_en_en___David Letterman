==Early life and career==
Letterman was born in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. His father, Harry Joseph Letterman (April 15, 1915&nbsp;– February 13, 1973),<ref>Record of Harry Letterman, [[Social Security Death Index]]</ref> was a florist.<ref>[http://playboysfw.kinja.com/david-lettermans-1984-playboy-interview-a-candid-conv-1557838143 David Letterman's 1984 Playboy Interview.

He lived on the north side of Indianapolis ([[Broad Ripple]] area), not far from Speedway, Indiana, and the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], and he enjoyed collecting model cars, including racers.<ref>Gary Graves. "Letterman Gets Moment in Hot Seat." ''[[USA Today]]'', May 23, 2005, p. 1C.</ref> In 2000, he told an interviewer for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' that, while growing up, he admired his father's ability to tell jokes and be the life of the party. Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/daveheart-letterman-0500 |title=Dave Letterman Profile&nbsp;— Interview with David Letterman |publisher=Esquire |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref> The elder Letterman died of a second heart attack<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2000-01-14/news/18138686_1_angioplasty-family-history-high-cholesterol| title=Cholesterol high, has family history |author=Mitchell Fink, Eric Mink, Leo Standora, Richard Huff, Bill Hutchinson| work=Daily News|location=New York| date=January 14, 2000| accessdate=November 6, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> at age 57.
[[File:DavidLettermanAtBSU.JPG|alt=|thumb|Letterman's association with Ball State University is recognized by a renaming ceremony for their David Letterman Communication and Media Building in 2006.]]
Letterman attended his hometown's [[Broad Ripple High School]] at the same time as [[Marilyn Tucker Quayle|Marilyn Tucker]] (future wife of Dan Quayle) and worked as a stock boy at the local Atlas Supermarket.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://lostindiana.net/2004/11/30/atlas-supermarket-broad-ripple/ |title= Atlas Supermarket |publisher=Lost Indiana |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> According to the ''Ball State Daily News'', he originally had wanted to attend [[Indiana University]], but his [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] were not good enough, so he instead attended [[Ball State University]], in [[Muncie, Indiana]].<ref>Gail Koch. "After Two Decades, Letterman Wit Shows No Signs of Stopping." ''Ball State Daily News'', February 23, 2002.</ref> He is a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity, and he graduated in 1969 from what was then the Department of Radio and Television. A self-described average student, Letterman later endowed a scholarship for what he called "C students" at Ball State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/average.phtml |title=Scholarships &#124; Scholarships for Average Students |publisher=FinAid |date=1999-01-22 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

Though he registered for the draft and passed his physical after graduating from college, he was not drafted for service in [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] because of receiving a [[draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]] number of 352 (out of 366).<ref>Revealed on air during January 7, 2011 ''Late Show with David Letterman'' during interview with Regis Philbin.</ref>

Letterman began his broadcasting career as an announcer and newscaster at the college's student-run radio station—[[WBST]]—a 10-watt campus station which now is part of [[Indiana Public Radio]].<ref name="BSU-PR">[http://www.bsu.edu/ipr/aboutus/history.htm ]{{Dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> He was fired for treating classical music with irreverence.<ref name="BSU-PR"/> He then became involved with the founding of another campus station—WAGO-AM 570 (now [[WWHI]], 91.3).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelradio.com/tc/index.html#dlwago69|title=David Letterman, WAGO Muncie Indiana |date=April 1, 1969 |publisher=reelradio.com|quote=Dave Letterman is heard in this segment edited from the 11PM–12 midnight hour on April 1, 1969.

He credits [[Paul Dixon (entertainer)|Paul Dixon]], host of the ''[[Paul Dixon Show]]'', a Cincinnati-based talk show also shown in Indianapolis while he was growing up, for inspiring his choice of career:<ref name="dixon">{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1997/02/24/loc_letterman.html|title=Local show inspired young Letterman|author=Kiesewetter, John|publisher=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]| date=1997-02-24| accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>
<blockquote>I was just out of college [in 1969], and I really didn't know what I wanted to do. And then all of a sudden I saw him doing it [on TV]. And I thought: That's really what I want to do!</blockquote>

===Weatherman===
Letterman began his career as a radio talk show host on WNTS (AM), and on Indianapolis television station WLWI (now called [[WTHR]]) as an anchor, and [[Meteorologist|weatherman]]. He received some attention for his unpredictable on-air behavior, which included congratulating a [[tropical storm]] for being upgraded to a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] and predicting [[hail]] stones "the size of canned hams."<ref>[http://www.playboy.com/articles/david-letterman-interview/index.html ]{{Dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> He would also occasionally report the weather and the day's very high and low temps for fictitious cities ("Eight inches of snow in Bingree and surrounding areas") while on another occasion saying that a state border had been erased.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GztPB3bKpgY| title=Diane Sawyer brings a clip of Dave:)| publisher= YouTube| date=October 13, 2009| accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> ("From space you can see the border between Indiana and Ohio has been erased. I'm not in favor of this.") He also starred in a local kiddie show, made wisecracks as host of a late night TV show called "Freeze-Dried Movies" (he once acted out a scene from ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' using plastic dinosaurs),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/395/000022329/ |title=David Letterman |publisher= Nndb.com |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> and hosted a talk show that aired early on Saturday mornings called ''Clover Power'',<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bzbq8X8qZE#t32s| title=Letterman morning show clips and & Jon Stewart cancellation -Jun1995| publisher=YouTube| date=January 22, 2010| accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> in which he interviewed [[4-H]] members about their projects.<ref>[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/l/letterman_david/letterman.html ]{{Dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

In 1971, Letterman appeared as a pit road reporter for [[ABC Sports]]' tape-delayed coverage of the [[1971 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]].<ref name="indy">{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sMnBmHzAg0|title= Letterman's Network Debut| publisher=YouTube| author=bricksterr|date=July 3, 2007| accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> Letterman was initially introduced as [[Chris Economaki]] in his job as a corner reporter.

===Move to Los Angeles===
[[File:The Comedy Store.jpg|alt=|thumb|Letterman's comedic career took hold at Los Angeles' [[The Comedy Store|Comedy Store]].]]
In 1975, encouraged by his then-wife Michelle and several of his [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity brothers, Letterman moved to Los Angeles, California, with hope of becoming a comedy writer.<ref>Gail Koch.

His dry, sarcastic humor caught the attention of scouts for ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and Letterman was soon a regular guest on the show.

===Morning show===

On June 23, 1980, Letterman was given his own morning comedy show on [[NBC]], ''[[The David Letterman Show]]''. It was originally 90 minutes long, but was shortened to 60 minutes in August 1980.<ref>Peter Kerr. "David Letterman's Off-Center Humor Finds a Home." The New York Times, February 19, 1984, p.

NBC kept Letterman under contract to try him in a different time slot. ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' debuted February 1, 1982; the first guest on the first show was [[Bill Murray]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Murray @ David Letterman #1, 1982, 1 of 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7PU6tidM|publisher=YouTube|year=1982|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> Murray later went on to become one of Letterman's most recurrent guests and also guested on the show's 30th anniversary episode, aired January 31, 2012. The show ran Monday through Thursday at 12:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern time zone|Eastern Time]], immediately following ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (a Friday night broadcast was added in June 1987). It was seen as being edgy and unpredictable, and soon developed a cult following (particularly among college students).

In 1992, [[Johnny Carson]] retired, and many fans believed that Letterman would become host of ''The Tonight Show''. When NBC instead gave the job to [[Jay Leno]], Letterman departed NBC to host his own late-night show on [[CBS]], opposite ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' at 11:30&nbsp;p.m., called the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. The new show debuted on August 30, 1993 and was taped at the historic [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], where [[Ed Sullivan]] broadcast his [[The Ed Sullivan Show|eponymous variety series]] from 1948 to 1971. For Letterman's arrival, CBS spent $8 million in renovations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-03-31/features/9503310282_1_cbs-store-letterman-show-times-square|title=Letterman's Neighbor's Discover Spotlight's Chilly Side|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|author=Mark Albright|date=March 31, 1995|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> In addition to that cost, CBS also signed Letterman to a lucrative three-year, $14 million/year contract,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305416,00.html|title=Is Dave Worth It?|work=Entertainment Weekly|author=Mark Harris|date=January 29, 1993|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> doubling his ''Late Night'' salary. The total cost for everything (renovations, negotiation right paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer [[Bill Wendell]], Shaffer, the writers and the band) was over $140 million.

But while the expectation was that Letterman would retain his unique style and sense of humor with the move, ''Late Show'' was not an exact replica of his old NBC program. Recognizing the more formal mood (and wider audience) of his new time slot and studio, Letterman eschewed his trademark [[blazer]] with [[khaki]] pants and white wrestling shoes wardrobe combination in favor of expensive shoes, tailored suits and light-colored socks. The monologue was lengthened. [[Paul Shaffer]] and the "[[World's Most Dangerous Band]]" followed Letterman to CBS, but they added a brass section and were [[rebranded]] the "[[CBS Orchestra]]" as a short monologue and a small band were mandated by Carson while Letterman occupied the 12:30 slot. Additionally, because of intellectual property disagreements, Letterman was unable to import many of his ''Late Night'' segments verbatim,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/davidletterman82/TimeAugust1993Article.html|work=Time|title=Stupid Talk Show Tricks| author=Richard Corliss|date=August 2, 1993|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> but he sidestepped this problem by simply renaming them (the "Top Ten List" became the "Late Show Top Ten", "Viewer Mail" became the "CBS Mailbag", etc.)

[[File:Conan O'Brien - Simpsons (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Simpsons'' and ''Saturday Night Live'' writer [[Conan O'Brien]] went from an entertainment unknown to hosting Letterman's old show on NBC]]
The main competitor of ''The Late Show'' is NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', which was [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|hosted by Jay Leno]] for 21 years<!--Letterman started after Leno-->, but from June 1, 2009, to January 22, 2010, was [[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|hosted]] by [[Conan O'Brien]]. In 1993 and 1994, ''The Late Show'' consistently gained higher ratings than ''The Tonight Show''. But in 1995, ratings dipped and Leno's show consistently beat Letterman's in the ratings from the time that [[Hugh Grant]] came on Leno's show after Grant's arrest for soliciting a prostitute;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-07/entertainment/letterman.show.ratings_1_local-people-meters-rating-points-viewers?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Viewers still in Letterman's corner|publisher=CNN|author=Breeanna Hare|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Leno typically attracted about 5 million nightly viewers between 1999 and 2009.

Letterman's shows have garnered both critical and industry praise, receiving 67 [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning 12 times in his first 20 years in late night television. From 1993 to 2009, Letterman ranked higher than Leno in the annual [[Harris Interactive|Harris Poll]] of ''Nation's Favorite TV Personality'' 12 times.<ref name="harris09"/> For example, in 2003 and 2004 Letterman ranked second in that poll, behind only [[Oprah Winfrey]], a year that Leno was ranked fifth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=530|title= For Third Year in a Row Oprah Retains Her Position as America's Favorite TV Personality|publisher= the [[Harris Interactive|Harris Poll]]|date= December 29, 2004}}</ref> Leno was higher than Letterman on that poll three times during the same period, in 1998, 2007, and 2008.<ref name="harris09">{{cite web|url= http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/pubs/Harris_Poll_2009_01_28.pdf|title= America's Favorite Television Personality|publisher= a [[Harris Interactive|Harris Poll]]|date= January 28, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

===Hosting the Academy Awards===
On March 27, 1995, Letterman acted as the host for the [[67th Academy Awards]] ceremony. Critics blasted Letterman for what they deemed a poor hosting of the Oscars, noting that his irreverent style undermined the traditional importance and glamor of the event.<ref name="John O'Connor">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-winner-isn-t-david-letterman.html|title=The Winner Isn't David Letterman|work=The New York Times|author=John O'Connor|date=March 29, 1995|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> In a joke about their unusual names (inspired by a celebrated comic essay in ''The New Yorker'', "Yma Dream" by Thomas Meehan), he started off by introducing [[Uma Thurman]] to [[Oprah Winfrey]], and then both of them to [[Keanu Reeves]]: "Oprah...Uma. Uma...Oprah," "Have you kids met Keanu?" This and many of his other jokes fell flat.<ref name="John O'Connor"/> Although Letterman attracted the highest ratings to the annual telecast since 1983, many felt that the bad publicity garnered by Letterman's hosting caused a decline in the ''Late Show'''s ratings.<ref name="RS">{{Cite news|first=Fred|last=Schruers|title= Dave vs. Dave: Forget Leno & Koppel&nbsp;— Letterman May Be His Own Worst Enemy|work=Rolling Stone|date=May 30, 1996|url=http://www.geocities.com/davidletterman82/RollingStone1996Interview.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071127145433/http://www.geocities.com/davidletterman82/RollingStone1996Interview.html|archivedate=2007-11-27}}</ref>

Letterman recycled the apparent debacle into a long-running gag. On his first show after the Oscars, he joked, "Looking back, I had no idea that thing was being televised." He lampooned his stint two years later, during [[Billy Crystal]]'s opening Oscar skit, which also parodied the plane-crashing scenes from that year's chief nominated film, ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.

For years afterward, Letterman recounted his hosting the Oscars, although the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] continued to hold Letterman in high regard and they had invited him to host the Oscars again.<ref name="NF">{{Cite news|first=Nikki|last=Finke|title= The 411 about David Letterman & Oscar|work=Deadline Hollywood Daily|date=February 25, 2008|url=http://www.deadline.com/2008/02/the-411-about-david-letterman-oscar/}}</ref><ref name=Bruce>{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Joel|work=A.V.

===Heart surgery hiatus===
On January 14, 2000, a routine check-up revealed that an artery in Letterman's heart was severely obstructed. He was rushed to emergency surgery for a [[coronary artery bypass surgery|quintuple bypass]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/nyregion/artery-blocked-letterman-has-heart-bypass-surgery.html?sec=health|title = Artery Blocked, Letterman Has Heart Bypass Surgery| work = The New York Times| date = January 15, 2000| accessdate = March 23, 2009 | first=Tina | last=Kelley}}</ref>

During the initial weeks of his recovery, reruns of the ''Late Show'' were shown and introduced by friends of Letterman including [[Drew Barrymore]],<ref name="Who's loyal"/> [[Ray Romano]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Megan Mullally]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Charles Grodin]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Julia Roberts]],<ref name="Who's loyal"/> [[Bruce Willis]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Martin Short]], [[Steven Seagal]], [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]].

Subsequently, while still recovering from surgery, Letterman revived the late night tradition that had virtually disappeared on network television during the 1990s of 'guest hosts' by allowing [[Bill Cosby]], [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] (recommended by Regis Philbin, who was asked first but had no time in his schedule), [[Dana Carvey]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], and others to host new episodes of ''The Late Show''. Cosby—the show's first guest host—refused to sit at Letterman's desk out of respect, using the couch instead; Garofalo followed suit, using a set of grade-school desks instead.

Upon his return to the show on February 21, 2000, Letterman brought all but one of the doctors and nurses on stage who had participated in his surgery and recovery (with extra teasing of a nurse who had given him bed baths—"This woman has seen me naked!"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popstarsplus.com/celebrities_davidletterman.htm |title=David Letterman biography |publisher=Popstarsplus.com |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> including Dr. O. Wayne Isom and physician [[Louis Aronne]], who frequently appears on the show. In a show of emotion, Letterman was nearly in tears as he thanked the health care team with the words "These are the people who saved my life!" The episode earned an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination. For a number of episodes, Letterman continued to crack jokes about his bypass, including saying, "Bypass surgery: it's when doctors surgically create new blood flow to your heart. A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get ''The Tonight Show!'' It's a whole different thing." In a later running gag he lobbied his home state of Indiana to rename the freeway circling Indianapolis (I-465) "The David Letterman Bypass." He also featured a montage of faux news coverage of his bypass surgery, which included a clip of Letterman's  heart for sale on the [[Home Shopping Network]]. Letterman became friends with his doctors and nurses. In 2008, a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview stated "he hosted a doctor and nurse who'd helped perform the emergency quintuple-bypass heart surgery that saved his life in 2000. 'These are people who were complete strangers when they opened my chest,' he says. 'And now, eight years later, they're among my best friends.' "<ref name="rs2008"/>

Additionally, Letterman invited the band [[Foo Fighters]] to play "[[Everlong]]",<ref name="mtvfoo">{{cite web| title=Foo Fighters To Welcome Letterman Back To 'Late Show' | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429027/20000216/foo_fighters.jhtml | last=Basham | first=David | publisher=MTV | date=2000-02-16 | accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref> introducing them as "my favorite band, playing my favorite song."<ref name="salonfoo">{{cite web| title=The top 10 reasons David Letterman's heart bypass operation was a good thing | url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/mill/2000/03/20/letterman | last=Millman | first=Joyce | work=Salon | date=2000-03-20 | accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref> During a later Foo Fighters appearance, Letterman said that Foo Fighters had been in the middle of a South American tour which they canceled to come play on his comeback episode.

Letterman again handed over the reins of the show to several guest hosts (including [[Bill Cosby]], [[Brad Garrett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Luke Wilson]] and bandleader [[Paul Shaffer]]) in February 2003, when he was diagnosed with a severe case of [[Herpes zoster|shingles]]. Later that year, Letterman made regular use of guest hosts—including [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] and [[Kelsey Grammer]]—for new shows broadcast on Fridays. In March 2007, [[Adam Sandler]]—who had been scheduled to be the lead guest—served as a guest host while Letterman was ill with a stomach virus.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/arts/television/20cnd-letterman.html?ex=1175313600&en=e887f76d9783d7e7&ei=5070|title = Letterman is Ill, so Guest Takes Over Late Show| work = The New York Times|date = March 20, 2007| accessdate = March 29, 2007 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}</ref>

===Re-signing with CBS===
[[File:David Letterman.jpg|right|thumb|Letterman hosting President [[Barack Obama]] at ''Late Show with David Letterman'', September 2009]]
In March 2002, as Letterman's contract with CBS neared expiration, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] offered him the time slot for long-running news program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' with [[Ted Koppel]]. Letterman was interested as he believed he could never match Leno's ratings at CBS due to Letterman's complaint of weaker [[lead-in]]s from the network's [[11 O'Clock News|late local news]] programs, but was reluctant to replace Koppel.<ref name="battle">"[http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=562114 The Battle for Late Night]" [[A&E Network]], April 27, 2010.</ref> Letterman addressed his decision to re-sign on the air, stating that he was content at CBS and that he had great respect for Koppel.

On December 4, 2006, [[CBS]] revealed that Letterman signed a new contract to host ''The Late Show with David Letterman'' through the fall of 2010. "I'm thrilled to be continuing on at CBS," said Letterman. "At my age you really don't want to have to learn a new commute."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650213242/Dave-will-outlast-Jay.html| title=Dave will outlast Jay| date= December 8, 2006| first=Scott D.| last= Pierce| newspaper= Deseret News}}</ref> Letterman further joked about the subject by pulling up his right pants leg, revealing a [[tattoo]], presumably temporary, of the ABC logo.

"Thirteen years ago, David Letterman put CBS late night on the map and in the process became one of the defining icons of our network," said [[Leslie Moonves]], president and CEO of CBS Corporation. "His presence on our air is an ongoing source of pride, and the creativity and imagination that the ''Late Show'' puts forth every night is an ongoing display of the highest quality entertainment. We are truly honored that one of the most revered and talented entertainers of our time will continue to call CBS 'home.'"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=13| title=CBS Signs David Letterman As Host Of The 'Late Show' Through Fall 2010| date=December 4, 2006| publisher=CBS}}</ref>

According to a 2007 article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Letterman earned $40 million a year.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/53/07celebrities_David-Letterman_C8CO.html|title = #17 David Letterman | work=Forbes | date=June 14, 2007}}</ref> A 2009 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, said his salary was estimated at $32 million per year.<ref name="nyt09carter"/>  In June 2009, Letterman's Worldwide Pants and CBS reached agreement to continue the ''Late Show'' until at least August 2012. The previous contract had been set to expire in 2010, and the two-year extension is shorter than the typical three-year contract period negotiated in the past.<ref name="nyt09carter">{{cite news| last=Carter |first=Bill |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/arts/television/10letterman.html |title=Letterman Reaches a Deal With CBS to Extend ‘Late Show’ |work= The New York Times |date=June 6, 2009 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}</ref> Worldwide Pants agreed to lower its fee for the show, though it had remained a "solid moneymaker for CBS" under the previous contract.<ref name="nyt09carter"/>

On the February 3, 2011, edition of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'', during an interview with [[Howard Stern]], Letterman said he would continue to do his talk show for "maybe two years, I think."<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.tv.com/is-david-letterman-ready-to-be-done-with-the-late-show/story/25084.html |title= Is David Letterman Ready to be Done with the Late Show? | first=Seth|last= Abramovitch | date= February 4, 2011 | publisher= [[TV.com]] | quote= Dave tried valiantly to change the subject to Stern’s new Sirius deal, rumored to be worth even more than the $500 million contract he signed with them in 2005.

To which Letterman replied: "Maybe two years, I think?" | accessdate=2011-06-17}}</ref>

In April 2012, CBS announced it had extended its contract with Letterman through 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304023504577321670048071482.html |title=CBS Extends Letterman Contract Through 2014 | author= Christopher S.

===Retirement===
During the taping of his April 3, 2014 show, David Letterman announced that he had informed CBS president [[Leslie Moonves]] that he will be retiring from hosting ''The Late Show'' by May 20, 2015.<ref name=cbsretire/><ref name=retire>{{cite news|title=David Letterman to Retire From CBS' 'Late Show' in 2015.|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/david-letterman-retire-cbs-late-693420|accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 3, 2014|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg}}</ref> It was announced soon after that comedian and political satirist [[Stephen Colbert]] would succeed Letterman.

==Notable exchanges and incidents==

===NBC and Johnny Carson===
[[File:JohnnyCarson1994.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Johnny Carson]] in 1994 (pictured here shortly after his 1992 retirement) was an inspiration and mentor to Letterman]]
In spite of [[Johnny Carson]]'s clear intention to pass his title to Letterman, NBC selected [[Jay Leno]] to host ''The Tonight Show'' after Carson's departure.<ref>{{Cite news| work=The Independent|date=January 24, 2005|work=Johnny Carson, king of late-night chat, dies at 79| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/johnny-carson-king-of-latenight-chat-dies-at-79-488063.html| accessdate=July 6, 2009 | location= London}}</ref> Letterman maintained a close relationship with Carson through his break with NBC. Three years after he left for CBS, [[HBO]] produced a made-for-television movie called ''[[The Late Shift (film)|The Late Shift]]'', based on a book by ''New York Times'' reporter Bill Carter, chronicling the battle between Letterman and Leno for the coveted ''Tonight Show'' hosting spot.

Carson later made a few [[cameo appearance]]s as a guest on Letterman's show. Carson's final television appearance came May 13, 1994, on a ''Late Show'' episode taped in Los Angeles, when he made a surprise appearance during a '[[Top Ten list (David Letterman)|Top 10 list]]' segment. The audience went wild as Letterman stood up and proudly invited Carson to sit at his desk. The applause was so protracted that Carson was unable to say anything, and he finally returned backstage as the applause continued. (It was later explained that Carson had [[laryngitis]], though Carson can be heard talking to Letterman during his appearance.)

In early 2005, it was revealed that Carson occasionally sent jokes to Letterman, who used these jokes in his monologue; according to CBS senior vice president [[Peter Lassally]] (a one-time producer for both men), Carson got "a big kick out of it."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600106891/TV-critics-genuinely-fond-of-Carson.html| title= TV critics genuinely fond of Carson | date = January 24, 2005 | first = Scott D. | last = Pierce | accessdate = February 27, 2012|work = Deseret News}}</ref> Letterman would do a characteristic Johnny Carson golf swing after delivering one of Carson's jokes. In a tribute to Carson, all of the opening monologue jokes during the first show following Carson's death were written by Carson.

Lassally also claimed that Carson had always believed Letterman, not Leno, to be his "rightful successor."<ref>{{Cite news| work=New York Post| url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20%2C+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES| accessdate=December 17, 2006}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> During the early years of the ''Late Show''{{'}}s run, Letterman occasionally used some of Carson's trademark bits, including "[[Carnac the Magnificent]]" (with [[Paul Shaffer]] as Carnac), "Stump the Band", and the "Week in Review."

===Oprah Winfrey===
[[File:Oprah Winfrey (2004).jpg|alt=|thumb|Letterman had a long-term feud with daytime talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]] which culminated in the two making several media appearances together]]
[[Oprah Winfrey]] appeared on Letterman's show when he was hosting NBC's ''Late Night'' on May 2, 1989.  Following that appearance, the two had a 16-year feud which according to Letterman started when he and his girlfriend decided to skip out on a bill, tricking the waiter into thinking Oprah agreed to pay it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bauderap |first= David |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/free-lunch-behind-16-year-letterman-oprah-feud/story-e6frfmyi-1225932672545 |title=Free lunch behind 16-year Letterman, Oprah feud |publisher=News.com.au |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>

The feud apparently ended in 2005 when Winfrey appeared on CBS's ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on December 2, in an event Letterman jokingly referred to as "the [[Super Bowl]] of Love".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tv.yahoo.com/show/32704/news/urn:newsml:tv.ap.org:20070830:people_winfrey_letterman__ER:1759|publisher = Yahoo.TV| title = Letterman to appear on `Oprah'}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

Winfrey and Letterman also appeared together in a ''Late Show'' promo that aired during CBS's coverage of [[Super Bowl XLI]] in February 2007, with the two sitting next to each other on the couch watching the game. Since the game was played between the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Chicago Bears]], the Indianapolis-born Letterman wears a [[Peyton Manning]] jersey, while Winfrey—who tapes her show in Chicago—is in a [[Brian Urlacher]] jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_i5we6MB-w|publisher = YouTube| title = Dave and Oprah's Super Bowl of Love}}</ref> On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. He shared pictures of his son and future wife, Regina Lasko.

Three years later, during CBS's coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIV]], the two appeared again in a ''Late Show'' promo, this time with Winfrey sitting on a couch between Letterman and Jay Leno. This time Letterman was wearing the retired No. 70 jersey of Colts' Hall of Fame and Letterman regular guest, [[Art Donovan]].
