'''Chester Robert "Chet" Huntley''' (December 10, 1911 &ndash; March 20, 1974) was an American [[television]] newscaster, best known for co-anchoring [[NBC|NBC's]] evening news program, ''[[Huntley-Brinkley Report|The Huntley-Brinkley Report]],'' for 14 years beginning in 1956.

==Early life==
Huntley was born in [[Cardwell, Montana|Cardwell]], [[Montana]], the only son and oldest of four children born to Percy Adams Huntley and Blanche Wadine ([[née]] Tatham) Huntley.  His father was a [[Telegraphist|telegraph operator]] for the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], and young Chet was born in Cardwell depot's living quarters.  Owing to the railroad's seniority system, wherein employees with longer tenure could "bump" newer employees, the family moved often, living in Cardwell, [[Saco, Montana|Saco]], [[Willow Creek, Montana|Willow Creek]], [[Logan, Montana|Logan]], [[Big Timber, Montana|Big Timber]], [[Norris, Montana|Norris]], [[Whitehall, Montana|Whitehall]], and [[Three Forks, Montana|Three Forks]] when he was a child.<ref name=OyanK-GFT-1999-12-19>Oyan, Katie (December 19, 1999). - "Chester R.

He graduated from Whitehall High School in [[Whitehall, Montana|Whitehall]],<ref name=OyanK-GFT-1999-12-19 /> and attended [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State College]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]], where he was a member of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] [[fraternity]]. He attended [[Cornish College of the Arts]] in [[Seattle]] before graduating from the [[University of Washington]] in 1934, with a degree in speech and drama.<ref name="nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu">[http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv21549 Guide to the Chet Huntley Papers at the University of Montana]</ref>

==Career==
Huntley began his radio newscast career at [[Seattle]]'s [[KIRO (AM)|KIRO AM]], later working on radio stations in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] (KHQ) and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. His time (1936–37) in Portland was with KGW-AM, owned by ''The Oregonian'', a Portland daily newspaper. At KGW he was writer, newscaster and announcer. In 1937 he went to work for KFI in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], moving to [[CBS Radio]] from 1939–51, then [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] from 1951-55.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/H/htmlH/huntleychet/huntleychet.htm Huntley, Chet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1955, he joined the [[NBC Radio]] network, viewed by network executives as "another [[Edward R. Murrow|Ed Murrow]]."

In 1956, coverage of the national political conventions was a major point of pride for the fledgling broadcast news organizations. [[NBC News]] executives were seeking to counter the growing popularity of [[CBS]]' [[Walter Cronkite]], who had been a ratings success at the 1952 conventions. They decided to replace their current news anchor, [[John Cameron Swayze]], but there was a disagreement on who the new anchorman should be. The two leading contenders were Huntley and [[David Brinkley]]. The eventual decision was to have both men share the assignment. Their on-air chemistry was apparent from the start, with Huntley's straightforward presentation countered by Brinkley's acerbic wit.

This success soon led to the team replacing Swayze on the network's nightly news program. It was decided to have the two men co-anchor the show; Huntley from [[New York City]], Brinkley from [[Washington, D.C.]] ''The [[Huntley-Brinkley Report]]'' began in October 1956 and was soon a ratings success. Huntley and Brinkley's catchphrase closing of "Good night, Chet" - "Good night, David... and good night for NBC News" was developed by the show's producer, [[Reuven Frank]]. Although both anchors initially disliked it, the sign-off became famous. Huntley and Brinkley gained great celebrity themselves, with surveys showing them better known than [[John Wayne]], [[Cary Grant]], [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] or [[the Beatles]]. The gregarious Huntley remained the same, a friend commenting in 1968 that "Chet is warm, he's friendly, he's unaffected, he's--well, he's just so damned nice."<ref>{{cite journal|title=An Accident of Casting|journal=The New Yorker|date=1968-08-03|pages=34–35}}</ref>

In April 1956, before that year's political conventions that brought him to prominence, Huntley began anchoring a new half-hour program entitled "Outlook," produced by Reuven Frank. The program aired for seven years, later changing its name to "Chet Huntley Reporting," and often covered racial segregation and civil rights. In January 1962, the program moved from the Sunday evening news time slot to prime time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Reuven|title=Out of Thin Air|location=New York|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1991|pages=91–95}}</ref>

Huntley wrote a memoir of his Montana childhood, ''The Generous Years: Remembrances of a Frontier Boyhood'', published by [[Random House]] in 1968.<ref>[http://worldcat.org/wcpa/ow/654ce8abd6d0b976.html The generous years; remembrances of a frontier boyhood. [WorldCat.org&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He also became involved in a New York advertising agency, Levine, Huntley, Schmidt, Plapler & Beaver, gaining a 10 percent share in the agency in exchange for having his name on the letterhead and attending some agency meetings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rothenberg|first=Randall|title=Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign|location=New York|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1994|page=68}}</ref> He maintained his own cattle farm near [[Stockton, New Jersey]], which for a short time in 1964 included a beef line from the farm's cattle promoted under his name before the network intervened due to [[conflict of interest]] and promotional concerns.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/31/huntley-ends-use-of-name-on-meat.html?_r=2|title=HUNTLEY ENDS USE OF NAME ON MEAT|last=Gould|first=Jack|date=31 March 1964|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=71|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

Huntley's last NBC News broadcast was aired on July 31, 1970. He returned to [[Montana]], where he conceived and built [[Big Sky Resort|Big Sky]], a ski resort south of [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]], which opened in December 1973.

==Death==
Huntley died of [[lung cancer]] in March 1974 at his home in [[Big Sky, Montana|Big Sky]] at the age of 62, three days before the opening ceremonies for Big Sky.<ref name="nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu"/> Huntley was honored with a cenotaph at [[Soldiers Chapel]] on the grounds of the Big Sky Resort.<ref name=lone>{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Jolene|title=Soldiers Chapel: a place of remembrance  |url=http://www.lonepeaklookout.com/news/article_52bba0c4-e768-5d66-a2fb-86ffa760f121.html|accessdate=25 June 2011|publisher=Lone Peak Lookout|date=25 May 2010}}</ref> [[Boyne USA|Boyne USA Resorts]] purchased the [[Big Sky Resort]] in 1976 and has owned and managed it since. Huntley was buried at Sunset Hills Cemetery in [[Bozeman, Montana]], just 50 miles east of his hometown of [[Cardwell, Montana]].

==Marriage==

Huntley's first marriage, to Ingrid Rolin, produced two daughters and ended in divorce in 1959.  Later that year, Huntley, at age forty-eight, married the former Tippy Stringer (1930–2010). After Huntley's death, Tippy married the [[widower]] [[William Conrad]] (1920–94), the star of [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'' [[detective]] series.

==Accolades==
In 1956 Huntley received the [[Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]].<ref>[http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/412-past-dupont-award-winners/594 All duPont–Columbia Award Winners], [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia Journalism School]]. Retrieved 2013-08-06.</ref>

In 1988, Huntley was posthumously inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/hall-of-fame-honorees|title=Television Hall of Fame Honorees: Complete List}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Only days before his retirement, Huntley gave an interview with [[Dick Cavett]], available on the [[DVD]] ''The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons'', Disc 2. On that broadcast, he described his political views as conservative on economic issues, but liberal on social issues. However, he insisted to Cavett and the other guests that he took pains to ensure that his personal views did not adversely affect his reporting during his years as a journalist.

In 2003, a biography titled ''Good Night Chet,'' by Lyle Johnston, was published by McFarland Publishers.

==Popular culture==
The [[Tom Lehrer]] song "So Long Mom (I'm Off to Drop the Bomb)" includes the verse:

:While we're attacking frontally
:Watch Brinkally and Huntally
:Describing contrapuntally
:The cities we have lost.
:No need for you to miss a minute of the agonizing holocaust.
