==Comedy career==

===Comedy partnership with Rob Huebel===
He has a long-standing comedic partnership with comedian [[Rob Huebel]] with whom he frequently works with at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] (UCBT) and in their former improvisational sketch comedy troupe [[Respecto Montalban]]. Perhaps the duo's best known creation was their long running two-man show ''Kung Fu Grip'' which they often performed at UCBT and other comedy venues for many years. The show was one of the featured acts in the 2004 HBO Comedy Arts Festival. Around this time they began appearing together in several of [[Comedy Central]] and [[VH1]]'s ''talking head'' commentary programs such as [[Best Week Ever]] and [[A2Z]]. They also appeared in [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo network]]'s ''100 Scariest Movie Moments'' special in 2004. These appearances got the duo their first mainstream exposure to television viewers. The two were instant fan favorites among regular viewers of the VH1 commentary programs. Riggle, Huebel and most of their fellow castmates from [[Respecto Montalban]] also performed regularly in comedic sketches on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade).

The duo's growing popularity landed them an audition on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the summer of 2004. They auditioned together, though only Riggle ended up making the cut. After spending one season on [[Saturday Night Live]] from 2004 to 2005, Riggle soon joined Huebel and many of his other ''Respecto Montalban'' castmates in [[Los Angeles]] to work on new projects. Soon after, the two landed a holding deal at [[NBC]] in early 2006 to develop a new half-hour comedy program for the network, though nothing has come of it since then.

In September 2006, Riggle joined ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as a regular correspondent. Around the same time Huebel (along with ''Respecto Montalban'' member [[Paul Scheer]] and stand-up comic [[Aziz Ansari]]) started developing ''[[Human Giant]]'', a sketch show for [[MTV]]. Riggle would often appear in the program's various sketches, as well as in the show's 24-hour live marathon which aired on MTV in May 2007. One of Riggle's most memorable guest appearances was as hired muscle, Ham-Bone, who appeared alongside [[Aziz Ansari]] in the season one sketch "Clell Tickle: Indie Marketing Guru". Riggle and Huebel can also be seen performing a sketch together on stage at the UCBT in [[Doug Benson]]'s documentary ''[[Super High Me]]''.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
A featured player during the 2004&ndash;2005 season, his first appearance as a cast member was on the show's thirtieth season premiere on October 2, 2004. He has portrayed [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Howard Dean]], [[Rick Sanchez]], [[Mark McGwire]], and [[Toby Keith]], and had a one-shot character named Leviticus, a loud, violent street preacher who only appeared on a Weekend Update segment on the Christmas episode hosted by Robert De Niro (another sketch featuring Leviticus was scheduled to air on the episode hosted by [[Hilary Swank]], but that sketch was cut after dress rehearsal).

Prior to being hired as a cast member, Riggle also appeared in a non-speaking role in the previous season (season 29) in a pre-taped parody of ''[[Fear Factor]]''. Riggle played the father of one of the child contestants during the "Breakfast in Bed" challenge in which a child must eat the [[maggot]]s off a plate of [[Eggs Benedict]] or his parents will [[divorce]].

===''The Daily Show''===
In September 2006, he joined the cast of ''The Daily Show'' to replace the departing [[Rob Corddry]]. Riggle made his debut on ''The Daily Show'' on September 20, 2006.

During the [[2008 Olympics]], Riggle traveled to [[China]] to tape sketches for ''The Daily Show'', producing a four-part special feature titled "Rob Riggle: Chasing the Dragon."<ref>{{cite news| last=Bauder| first=David| date=2008-08-10| title=Rob Riggle's off the hook in China| agency=AP}}</ref>

Riggle left ''The Daily Show'' on December 10, 2008, in his words "to go fight crime"; however, he appeared at [[2009 Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo 2009]] - along with [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and [[Rory Albanese]], one of the show's [[executive producer]]s - in a show entitled ''An Evening (or Afternoon) with The Daily Show featuring John Oliver, Rob Riggle & Rory Albanese''.

On August 3, 2010, Riggle made a surprise cameo on ''The Daily Show'' during an interview with [[Will Ferrell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-august-3-2010/will-ferrell |title=August 3, 2010 - Daily Show: Will Ferrell |publisher=The Daily Show |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref> While Ferrell and Stewart began discussing Riggle's "lack of talent" and making other disparaging remarks about him, Riggle suddenly walked onto the set to surprise them and asks if they were talking about him. Riggle's intimidating presence appears to make Ferrell and Stewart visibly afraid, continuing the running-joke that Stewart is very afraid of Riggle.

===Stand-up comedy===
Previously, Riggle's live comedy work was mostly [[improvisational]] and sketch based, but beginning in 2006 he wanted to try something different and decided to work on creating a stand-up comedy act. After working on his act around various comedy clubs throughout New York City, he later began touring colleges and other local comedy clubs, often performing in stand-up shows with [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] and other writers from ''The Daily Show''. Riggle credits John Oliver for first encouraging him to try stand-up while they shared an office together at ''The Daily Show''.<ref>{{cite web|author=November 12, 2010 |url=http://whosnews.usaweekend.com/2010/11/rob-riggle-and-his-new-beard-guest-star-on-mondays-chuck-episode/ |title=Rob Riggle and his new beard guest-star on Monday's 'Chuck' episode |publisher=Whosnews.usaweekend.com |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>

Riggle hosted an episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s stand-up series ''[[Live at Gotham]]'' on December 4, 2009. He also taped a ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special that aired on March 5, 2010.

===Other work===
Riggle played the character of Eddie Reynolds in ''[[Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story]]'', a 2004 film starring Rob Corddry as the lead character, and featuring almost all of the Respecto Montalban group. Later that year Riggle was one of the "Flab Four" on the [[Comedy Central]] mini-series ''[[Straight Plan for the Gay Man]]'', a parody of ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' that ran for three episodes.

In 2006, Riggle guest-starred as a boat captain named Captain Jack on the "[[Booze Cruise (The Office episode)|Booze Cruise]]" episode of ''[[The Office (US)|The Office]]'', and as an anti-euthanasia activist on ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''. He was also seen as a [[NASCAR]] announcer in ''[[Talladega Nights]]'' with [[Will Ferrell]].

[[File:RobRiggleAug08.jpg|right|thumb| Riggle in 2008]]
In late 2007, Riggle began appearing as a spokesman in a series of [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] commercials. The year 2008 saw Riggle sign a talent holding contract with [[CBS]] and CBS Paramount Network TV, which includes a development deal to create and star in a half-hour comedy series.<ref>{{cite web| last=Schneider| first=Michael| title='Daily Show's' Riggle moves to CBS| date=2008-10-19| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994298.html?categoryid=14&cs=1| publisher=Variety| accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref> In addition he gained a supporting role in ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'', in which he plays a rude co-worker of Brennan ([[Will Ferrell]]). He had memorable supporting roles in the 2009 films ''[[The Hangover]]'' and ''[[The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard]]''. Riggle also had supporting roles in the 2010 comedies ''[[Going the Distance (2010 film)|Going the Distance]]'', ''[[Killers (2010 film)|Killers]]'', and ''[[The Other Guys]]''.

In 2009, Riggle started a recurring role on the ''[[CBS]]'' sitcom ''[[Gary Unmarried]]''. Riggle played the role of Mitch, Jay Mohr's brother from the Marines.

In 2010, Riggle and comedian [[Paul Scheer]] wrote and starred together in a series of sketches called "Designated Driver" for the first season of the [[HBO]] sketch comedy program ''[[Funny or Die Presents]]''. Riggle, Scheer and [[Rob Huebel]] wrote and starred in a new series of sketches called "Death Hunt", which appeared on the show's second season in 2011.

For the 2010-2011 [[NFL]] [[American Football|football]] season, Riggle recorded a [[Monday Night Football]] introduction and several short comedy bits for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] to be played at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

Riggle played the lead in 2011 [[CBS]] sitcom pilot "Home Game", executive produced by [[Mark Wahlberg]].

Riggle is seen in stadium monitors at [[Qwest Field]] during [[Seahawks]] games encouraging fans to cheer.

In May 2011, Riggle appeared in a 2-minute short on [[Funny or Die|funnyordie.com]] as the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] who [[death of Osama bin Laden|killed Osama bin Laden]].<ref>http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/8e464776e6/the-navy-seal-who-killed-osama-bin-lade</ref>  Riggle plays a humble [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] (though the insignia on his uniform displays three solid gold bands, indicating the O-5 rank of [[Commander (United States)|Commander)]] who, upon being awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], pledges absolute discretion—only to get intoxicated at a local bar and boast unreservedly to a large crowd that he was bin Laden's assailant.

Since 2011, Riggle has co-starred as "The President of the Navy" in the [[Adult Swim]] comedy-action series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]''.

In April 2012, Riggle was announced as the upcoming host of the 2012 [[ESPY Awards]] on [[ESPN]]. The show aired on July 11, 2012.
