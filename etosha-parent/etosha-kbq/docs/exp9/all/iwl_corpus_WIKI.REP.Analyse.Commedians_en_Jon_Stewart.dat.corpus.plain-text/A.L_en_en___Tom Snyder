'''Thomas James "Tom" Snyder''' (May 12, 1936 – July 29, 2007) was an American television personality, [[news anchor]], and radio personality best known for his late night talk shows ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'', on the [[NBC]] television network in the 1970s and 1980s, and ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'', on the [[CBS]] Television Network in the 1990s.<ref name=nytobit/> Snyder was also the pioneer anchor of the primetime ''NBC News Update'', in the 1970s and early 1980s, which was a one-minute capsule of news updates in primetime.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/obit.snyder.ap/index.html |title= 'Tomorrow' host Snyder dies at 71|accessdate=2007-07-30 |work=AP Wire |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070917082504/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/obit.snyder.ap/index.html |archivedate = September 17, 2007}}</ref>

==Early life==
Snyder was born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], to parents of [[Germany|German]], [[Cornwall|Cornish]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent, Frank and Marie Snyder. He received a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] upbringing and attended St. Agnes Elementary School and graduated from [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]–run [[Marquette University High School]]. He attended [[Marquette University]], after which he had originally planned to study medicine and become a doctor.<ref>{{cite news|title=After Years, Snyder's Back with Touch or 2 of Milwaukee| last=Dudek|first=Duane|date=January 7, 1995|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>

==Newscasting career==
Snyder had loved radio since he was a child and at some point changed his field of study from [[pre-med]] to journalism. He once told ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' reporter Tim Cuprisin that broadcasting became more important to him than attending classes, and he skipped a lot of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/cuprisin/archive/2007/07/30/remembering-tom-snyder.aspx|title=Remembering Tom: How he got started|last=Cuprisin|first=Tom|date=July 30, 2007|accessdate=2009-05-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Snyder began his career as a radio reporter at [[WJYI|WRIT]] (unrelated to the present-day [[WRIT-FM|FM station]]) in Milwaukee and at [[WKZO (AM)|WKZO]] in [[Kalamazoo]] (where he was fired by [[John Fetzer]]) in the 1950s. For a time he worked at [[Savannah, Georgia]], AM station WSAV (now [[WBMQ]]).

After moving to television in the 1960s, he was a news anchor for [[KYW-TV]] in [[Cleveland]] (now [[WKYC-TV]]) and, after a 1965 station switch, [[Philadelphia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/tomsnyder.html |title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia |publisher=Broadcastpioneers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}</ref> and [[WNBC-TV]] and [[WABC-TV]] in New York City. He talked about driving cross country in an early [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] from [[Atlanta]] to Los Angeles around 1963, where he landed a news job at [[KTLA]], then on to [[KNBC-TV]], also in Los Angeles, where from 1970 to 1974 he was an anchor for the 6 p.m. [[newscast]] working with KNBC broadcaster [[Kelly Lange]], who was then a weather reporter before serving as a long-time KNBC news anchor.  Lange later became Snyder's regular substitute [[guest host]] on the ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]]'' program, prior to the hiring of co-host [[Rona Barrett]] in the program's last year. Even after attaining fame as host of ''Tomorrow'', Snyder kept his hand in news anchoring with the Sunday broadcasts of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' during 1975 and 1976.

==''Tomorrow with Tom Snyder''==
Snyder gained national fame as the host of ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow with Tom Snyder]]'' (more commonly known as ''The Tomorrow Show)'', which aired late nights after ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' on [[NBC]] from 1973 to 1982. It was a talk show unlike the usual late-night fare, with Snyder, cigarette in hand, alternating between asking hard-hitting questions and offering personal observations that made the interview closer to a conversation.

Unique one-on-one exchanges were common to the program, notably with author [[Harlan Ellison]], [[John Lydon]] of [[Public Image Ltd|PiL]] and [[The Sex Pistols]] in 1980, [[John Lennon]] in 1975, actor and writer [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Charles Manson]], and author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]. A one-on-one program with [[David Brenner]] as the sole guest revealed that Snyder and Brenner worked together on several documentaries.

An infamous edition of ''The Tomorrow Show'' broadcast on October 31, 1979, saw Snyder interview the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]. During the episode, a visibly irritated [[Gene Simmons]] (bass) and [[Paul Stanley]] (guitar) tried to contain the bombastic (and drunk) [[Ace Frehley]] (lead guitar), whose nonstop laughter and joking overshadowed the rest of the band, though Snyder was obviously enjoying it, chiming in with several jokes, much to Frehley's delight, and Simmons's disgust. Drummer [[Peter Criss]] made repeated references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons. Some of the footage from this show was later included on the ''Kissology&nbsp;– The Ultimate KISS Collection'' Vol. 2: 1978–1991 (2007) DVD.

In the late 1970s, Snyder interviewed Disney animator Ward Kimball regarding his toy train collection and his full-size trains. Snyder appeared to be as happy as a "kid in a candy store," picking up various locomotives and asking lots of questions. The video segments could still be viewed on YouTube in 2015. Snyder's love of toy trains started with his first Lionel locomotive, a scale steam switcher, which he claimed never worked too well. His collection was later donated to a New Jersey toy train club, the NJ Hi-Railers.

When not grilling guests, Snyder would often joke around with offstage crewmen, often breaking out in the distinctively hearty laugh that was the basis of [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s impersonation of Snyder on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (12 occasions, 1976–79 and 1995).<ref>[http://snl.jt.org/imp.php?i=26 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> Following a disastrous experiment with turning ''Tomorrow'' into a more typical talk show—renaming it ''Tomorrow Coast to Coast'' and adding a live audience and co-host [[Rona Barrett]] (all of which Snyder resented)—the show was canceled in 1982 to make way for the up-and-coming young comedian [[David Letterman]].

==After ''Tomorrow''==
In 1982, Snyder joined WABC-TV in New York, anchoring the 5PM ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' program with [[Kaity Tong]]. He stayed at WABC for two years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ahUo5QXp2RwU&refer=us|title=Tom Snyder, Late-Night Television Talk Show Pioneer, Dies at 71}}</ref> then returned to the talk format in 1985 at [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles with a local afternoon show. He had hoped to syndicate the program nationally the following year, but those plans were scratched after [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Chicago-based syndicated show]] entered the market first, and took over Snyder's time slot on KABC-TV.

In 1988, Snyder inaugurated a very similar three-hour program on [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]]. The first hour was spent chatting with a celebrity guest; during the second hour Snyder engaged someone in the news; and the final hour was consumed chatting with his legion of fans. Occasionally the caller would be a well-known fan like David Letterman or [[Ted Koppel]]. One of Snyder's favorite callers was [[Sherman Hemsley]], the actor who played [[George Jefferson]] on the hit television sitcom ''[[The Jeffersons]]''. The ''Tom Snyder Show'' for ABC Radio Networks went off the air in late 1992.

Snyder returned to television on [[CNBC]] on January 21, 1993, adding the opportunity for viewers to call in with their own questions for his guests. Snyder nicknamed his show the Colorcast, reviving an old promotional term NBC-TV used in the early 1960s to brand its color broadcasts. He also continued his trademark of talking to offscreen crew and made frequent reference to the studio, reminding viewers of its location in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]]. The final CNBC show aired on December 1, 1994.

==''The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder''==
Meanwhile, Letterman had moved on to CBS and was given control of creating a new program to follow his at 12:35&nbsp;a.m. Letterman, who had idolized Snyder for years, hired Snyder in 1994 as host of ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''; the announcement was made by Letterman and CBS President Howard Stringer on August 9 that Snyder's show would begin on January 9, 1995. The idea had actually begun as a running joke on Letterman's show that Snyder would soon follow him on the air as he had once followed [[Johnny Carson]] on ''The Tonight Show''; the unlikely suggestion caught on. As part of the joke, Snyder appeared as himself in 1993 in ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' episode ''Life Behind Larry'', in which talk-show host Sanders ([[Garry Shandling]]) steals Snyder from Letterman to host a talk-show in the slot immediately after his.

''The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder'' aired live in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and was simulcast to other time zones on radio to allow everyone a chance to call in. Snyder's CNBC show was taken over, largely unchanged in format, by [[Charles Grodin]]. One of the many interviews conducted on ''The Late Late Show'' was with [[Gloria Vanderbilt]] about her son's suicide, told dramatically over an entire hour. Another was a lengthy interview with [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] very soon before Blake was charged with murder. Snyder's final ''Late Late Show'' aired on March 26, 1999. It was then reformatted for [[Craig Kilborn]]; his successor, Scottish comedian [[Craig Ferguson]], maintained a similar format. When Snyder took ill with the flu, comedians [[Martin Mull]] and [[Jon Stewart]] filled in as hosts.

In February 2000, Snyder hosted two shows of ''The Late Show Backstage'' which aired in ''The Late Show'' time slot when Letterman was recovering from heart surgery.

Snyder also hosted a video production called ''A Century of Legendary Lionel Trains'', commemorating 100 years of [[Lionel, LLC|Lionel]] Trains. Additionally, he hosted another program from the same production company called ''Celebrity Train Layouts 2: Tom Snyder'', featuring his own collection of trains.

==Colortini.com==
Snyder posted regular messages on his own now-defunct website colortini.com during the early 2000s. A "colortini," according to Snyder in the CNBC era, was the drink you should enjoy while watching the show ("Fire up a colortini, sit back, relax, and watch the pictures, now, as they fly through the air."). For the CBS show, he redubbed the mythical drink a "simultini" as his show was also heard on selected radio stations.

On July 28, 2005, Snyder announced he was deleting his website after six years, stating: "The novelty of communicating this way has worn off." On August 1, 2005, his page was abruptly taken offline. The front page was replaced with a white screen with the simple phrase: "Colortini is gone. Thanks for the Memories."<ref name="colortini">{{cite web|title=Colortini is Gone|url=http://www.colortini.com/ |publisher=Colortini|accessdate=May 13, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050803003956/http://www.colortini.com/ |archivedate = August 3, 2005}}</ref> However, some {{Wayback |date=* |url=http://www.colortini.com/h_index.html |title=140 pages }} have been preserved at web.archive.org. The [[domain name]] has since been reused for other purposes.

==Personal life==
Snyder was married once, to Mary Ann Bendel; they divorced in 1975.  Their daughter, Anne Marie, and two grandchildren live in [[Maui, Hawaii]].  After his divorce he lived for at least 20 years with a woman to whom he referred only as "The Companion" — later identified by the ''New York Times'' as Pamela Burke, a former executive producer of the ''Tomorrow'' program.<ref name=nytobit/><ref>Rona, Tom to be Reunited (November 22, 1980).

==Final years and death==
In April 2005 Snyder revealed that he had been diagnosed with [[leukemia|chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].  In June 2006 he sold his home in the [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Benedict Canyon]] area of Los Angeles, where he had lived for almost 30 years, and relocated to [[Belvedere, California|Belvedere]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where he owned a second home.

Snyder died of complications from [[leukemia]] on July 29, 2007, in [[San Francisco, California]] at the age of 71.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news |author=[[Bill Carter (reporter)|Bill Carter]] |coauthors= |title=Tom Snyder, a Pioneer of Late-Night Television, Dies at 71 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/arts/television/31snyder.html |quote=Tom Snyder, the idiosyncratic, cigarette-waving interviewer who was one of the pioneers of the late-night television talk show and a long-time anchor for both local and national news, died Sunday in San Francisco.
