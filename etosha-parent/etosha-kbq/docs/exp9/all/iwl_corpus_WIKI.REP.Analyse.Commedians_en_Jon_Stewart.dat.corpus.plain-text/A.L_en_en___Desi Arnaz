'''Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III''' (March 2, 1917 — December 2, 1986), better known as '''Desi Arnaz''' or '''Desi Arnaz, Sr.''', was a Cuban-born American musician, actor and television producer. He is best remembered for his role as [[Lucy and Ricky Ricardo|Ricky Ricardo]] on the American television series ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', starring with [[Lucille Ball]], to whom he was married at the time. Arnaz was also internationally renowned for leading his Latin music band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra. He and Ball are generally credited as the inventors of the [[rerun]] in connection with ''I Love Lucy''.<ref name="Ent 20081009">{{cite web|title=Desi Arnaz & Lucille Ball: The Geniuses Who Shaped The Future Of Television|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197550|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=January 28, 2013|date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>

==Early life==
Arnaz was born Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha, III, in [[Santiago de Cuba]] to [[Desiderio Alberto Arnaz II]] (March 8, 1894&nbsp;– May 31, 1973) and his wife Dolores de Acha (April 2, 1896&nbsp;– October 24, 1988).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Dolores-Lolita-Acha-de-Soc%C3%ADas/6000000001091867248|title=Dolores Acha de Socías (1896 - 1988)  - Genealogy|work=geni_family_tree}}</ref> His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives. His maternal grandfather was Alberto de Acha, an executive at [[Bacardi Rum]].<ref name="Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122">Gjelten, Tom. ''Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba: The Biography of a Cause''. Viking Adult, 2008, p. 122 (footnote).</ref> According to Arnaz, in his autobiography ''A Book'' (1976), the family owned three ranches, a palatial home, and a vacation mansion on a private island in Santiago Bay, Cuba. Following the 1933 Cuban Revolution, led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], which overthrew President [[Gerardo Machado]], Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his brother-in-law Alberto de Acha intervened on his behalf.<ref name="Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122"/> The family then fled to [[Miami]], where Desi attended St. Patrick Catholic High School. In the summer of 1934 he attended [[Saint Leo University|Saint Leo Prep]]<ref>Horgan, James J. (1990). ''Pioneer College: The Centennial History of Saint Leo College, Saint Leo Abbey, and Holy Name Priory''. Saint Leo College Press. p. 463.</ref> (near [[Tampa]]) to help improve his English.

==Film career==
When he moved to the United States, Desi Arnaz turned to show business to support himself. In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] the next year to appear in the show's movie version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred [[Lucille Ball]]. Arnaz and Ball married on November 30, 1940. Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].<ref name="Arnaz"/>

Arnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943). He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (U.S.O.) programs at a military hospital in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the [[United States Army]], he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===''I Love Lucy''===
[[File:Lucy desi 1957.JPG|Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, 1957.|thumb]]
On October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which he played a fictitious version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique "Ricky" Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, [[Lucille Ball]], who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} (The character name "Larry Lopez" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with "Ricky Ricardo".) Ricky would often appear at, and later own, the Tropicana Club which, under his ownership, he renamed Club Babalu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Initially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latino Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers.<ref name="title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito Pérez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of ''I Love Lucy''. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.
During his time on the show, he became TV's most successful entrepreneur.

==Desilu Productions==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
With Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and also adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Network executives considered the use of film an unnecessary extravagance. Arnaz convinced them to allow Desilu to cover all additional costs associated with filming, under the stipulation that Desilu owned and controlled all rights to the film. 

Arnaz also pushed the network to allow them to show Lucille Ball while she was pregnant. According to Arnaz,{{cn|date=March 2015}} the [[CBS]] network told him, "You cannot show a pregnant woman on television". Arnaz consulted a priest, a [[rabbi]], and a [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]], all of whom told him that there would be nothing wrong with showing a pregnant Lucy or with using the word ''pregnant''. The network finally relented and let Arnaz and Ball weave the pregnancy into the story line, but remained adamant about eschewing use of ''pregnant'', so Arnaz substituted ''expecting'', pronouncing it '' 'spectin' '' in his Cuban accent. Oddly, the official titles of two of the series' episodes employed the word ''pregnant'': "Lucy Is ''Enceinte''", employing the French word for pregnant, and "Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable", although the episode titles never appeared on the show itself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'', ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]) and was also involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]''/''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In the late 1950s', Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]].  Ror-Vic produced the ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was filmed not in [[Texas]] but mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110–112</ref>

The original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her remarriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from the ashes of his share of Desilu, and with the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1968. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as '''Desilu, Too'''. Both [[Desilu, Too]], and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video re-issues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Beliefs==
Arnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed "basic good taste" and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.

Arnaz was patriotic. In his memoirs, speaking of the United States, he wrote: "I know of no other country in the world" in which "a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language" could achieve the successes he had. Over the show's nine-year run, the fortunes of the Ricardos mirror that of the archetypal 1950s [[American Dream]]. At first, they lived in a tiny, if pleasant [[brownstone]] apartment. Later, Ricardo got his big chance and moved, temporarily, to a fashionable hotel suite in Hollywood. Shortly after returning to New York, they had the opportunity to travel to Europe. Finally, the couple moved into a house in wealthy [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], Connecticut.

==Marriages==
[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|250px|Arnaz and Lucille Ball in Los Angeles, 1953.]]
Arnaz and Ball's marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her, and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} He and Ball are the parents of actress [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and actor [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]] (born 1953).

Arnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and womanizing. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company as well as supervising its day-to-day operations had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Arnaz married his second wife, Edith Mack Hirsch, on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Torero (bullfighter)|matador]], Señor Delgado. Edith died in 1985.

Although both Arnaz and Ball remarried to other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends, and grew closer in his final decade. "'''I Love Lucy'' was never just a title", wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life.<ref>Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz {{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref> Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.

==Later life==

[[File:Desi arnaz sr and jr 1974.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Arnaz appeared with his son in the 1974 television special, ''California, My Way''.]]
In the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer [[Mike Douglas]]. [[Vivian Vance]] appeared as a guest. Arnaz also headlined a ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' special on [[NBC]] that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. To promote his autobiography, ''A Book'', on February 21, 1976, Arnaz served as a guest host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing. The program contained spoofs of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''. The spoofs of ''I Love Lucy'' were supposed to be earlier concepts of the show that never made it on the air, such as "I Love Louie", where Desi lived with [[Louis Armstrong]]. He also read [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem "[[Jabberwocky]]" in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it "Habberwocky"). Arnaz, Jr. played the drums and, supported by the ''SNL'' band, Desi sang both "[[Babalu (song)|Babalu]]" and another favorite from his dance band days, "[[Cuban Pete (song)|Cuban Pete]]"; the arrangements were similar to the ones used on ''I Love Lucy''. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the ''SNL'' studio.

Arnaz and his wife eventually moved to [[Del Mar, California]], where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement. He owned a [[horse breeding]] farm in [[Corona, California]], and raced [[thoroughbred]]s. He contributed to charitable and non-profit organizations, including [[San Diego State University]]. He also taught classes at [[San Diego State University]] in studio production and acting for television. Arnaz would make a guest appearance on the TV series ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', starring [[Linda Lavin]] and produced by ''I Love Lucy'' co-creators [[Madelyn Pugh]] (Madelyn Davis) and [[Bob Carroll, Jr.]]

==Death==
Arnaz was a regular smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of ''I Love Lucy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/Famous/g/Famous-Tobacco-Victims-Actor-Desi-Arnaz.htm|title=Famous Tobacco Victims - Desi Arnaz|author=Terry Martin|work=About.com Health}}</ref> He smoked Cuban cigars into his sixties.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-03/news/mn-486_1_desi-arnaz|title=Desi Arnaz, TV Lucy's Loving Co-Star, Dies|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1986. He died several months later on December 2, 1986, at the age of 69. Lucille telephoned him two days before his death, on what would have been their 46th wedding anniversary. 

Arnaz was cremated and his ashes scattered. His death came just five days before Lucille Ball received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. He was survived by his children and his mother, Dolores, who died on October 24, 1988 at the age of 92.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=RootsWeb: Database Index|work=ancestry.com}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref>
