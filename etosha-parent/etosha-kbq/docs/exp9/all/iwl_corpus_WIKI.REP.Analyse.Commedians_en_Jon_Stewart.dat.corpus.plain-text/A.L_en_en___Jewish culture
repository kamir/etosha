{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
'''Jewish culture''' is the diverse international [[culture]] of the [[Jew]]s. Since the formation of the Jewish nation in biblical times the [[international community]] of [[Jewish people]] has been considered a tribe or an [[ethnoreligious]] group rather than solely a religion. [[Judaism]] guides its adherents in both practice and belief, so that it has been called not only a [[Judaism|religion]], but an [[orthopraxy]].<ref>Biale, David, ''Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p.15</ref>  Not all individuals or all cultural phenomena can be classified as either "secular" or "religious", a distinction native to [[Enlightenment in Western secular tradition|Enlightenment]] thinking.<ref>Biale, David, ''Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought'', Princeton University Press, 2011, pp.5-6</ref>

Jewish culture in its etymological meaning retains the linkage to the [[Land of Israel|land of origin]], the people named for the [[Kingdom of Judah]], study of Jewish [[Torah study|texts]], practice of community [[Tzedakah|charity]], and [[Jewish history]]. The term "secular Jewish culture" therefore refers to many aspects, including: Religion and World View, Literature, Media, and Cinema, Art and Architecture, Cuisine and Traditional Dress, attitudes to Gender, Marriage, and Family, Social Customs and Lifestyles, Music and Dance.<ref>Torstrick, Rebecca L., ''Culture and customs of Israel'', Greenwood Press, 2004</ref> "Secular Judaism," is a distinct phenomenon related to Jewish secularization - a historical process of divesting all of these elements of culture from their religious beliefs and practices.<ref>Beit-Hallahmi, Benjamin, The Secular Israeli (Jewish) Identity: An Impossible Dream?, in Barry Alexander Kosmin, Ariela Keysar, eds., ''Secularism & secularity: contemporary international perspectives'', Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture, Trinity College, Hartford, 2007, p.157</ref>

Secular Judaism, derived from the philosophy of [[Moses Mendelssohn]],<ref>Biale, David, ''Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p.10</ref>  arose out of the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment, which was itself driven by the values of the Enlightenment. In recent years, the academic field of study, has encompassed Jewish Studies, History, Literature, Sociology, and Linguistics. Historian David Biale<ref>David Biale is the Emanuel Ringelblum Professor of Jewish History and the Chair of the Department of History at the University of California, Davis.</ref> has traced the roots of Jewish secularism back to the pre-modern era. He, and other scholars highlight the Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], who was dubbed "the renegade Jew who gave us modernity" by scholar and novelist [[Rebecca Goldstein|Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]]<ref>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, ''Betraying Spinoza: The renegade Jew who gave us modernity'', Schocken/Nextbook, 2006</ref> in an intellectual biography of him. Today, the subject of Jewish secularization is taught, and researched, at many North American and Israeli universities, including [[Harvard]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[UCLA]], [[Temple University]] and [[City University of New York]] which have significant Jewish alumni.  Additionally, many schools include the [[Jewish studies|academic study]] of Judaism and Jewish culture in their curricula.

Throughout history, in eras and places as diverse as the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world, in Europe before and after the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in [[Al-Andalus]], North Africa and the Middle East, in [[Indian Jews|India]] and [[History of the Jews in China|China]], and in the contemporary United States and [[Israel]], Jewish communities have seen the development of cultural phenomena that are characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews with host populations in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diasporas]], and others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities.

==History==
[[File:1900 photo of a Sephardi couple from Sarajevo.png|thumb|250px|Sephardi Jewish couple from Sarajevo in traditional clothing. Photo taken in 1900.]]
[[File:Lebenslauf Oblate.jpg|thumb|250px|Various stages of a Jewish male's life.]]
There has not been a political unity of Jewish society since the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]]. Since then [[Israelite]] populations were always geographically dispersed (see [[Jewish diaspora]]), so that by the 19th century the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] were mainly in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]; the [[Sephardi Jews]] were largely spread among various communities in the [[Mediterranean region]]; [[Mizrahi Jews]] were primarily spread throughout [[Western Asia]]; and other populations of Jews were in [[Central Asia]], [[Ethiopia]], the [[Caucasus]], and India. (See [[Jewish ethnic divisions]].)

Although there was a high degree of communication and traffic between these communities — many Sephardic exiles blended into the Ashkenazi communities in Central Europe following the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; many Ashkenazim migrated to the [[Ottoman Empire#Decline and modernization (1828–1908)|Ottoman Empire]], giving rise to the characteristic Syrian-Jewish family name "Ashkenazi"; Iraqi-Jewish traders formed a distinct [[Indian Jews#Baghdadi Jews|Jewish community]] in India; many of these populations were cut off to some degree from the surrounding cultures by [[ghetto]]ization, by [[Muslim]] laws of ''[[Dhimmi|dhimma]]'', and traditional discouragement of contact with [[Idolatry|polytheistic]] populations.

[[Medieval]] Jewish communities in Eastern Europe continued to display distinct cultural traits over the centuries. Despite the universalist leanings of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (and its echo within Judaism in the [[Haskalah]] movement), many [[Yiddish]]-speaking Jews in Eastern Europe continued to see themselves as forming a distinct national group — ''" 'am yehudi"'', from the Biblical Hebrew — but, adapting this idea to Enlightenment values, they assimilated the concept as that of an ethnic group whose identity did not depend on religion, which under Enlightenment thinking fell under a separate category.

[[Constantin Măciucă]] writes of "a differentiated but not isolated Jewish spirit" permeating the culture of Yiddish-speaking Jews.<ref>Măciucă, Constantin, preface to [[Israil Bercovici|Bercovici, Israil]], ''O sută de ani de teatru evriesc în România'' ("One hundred years of Yiddish/Jewish theater in Romania"), 2nd Romanian-language edition, revised and augmented by Constantin Măciucă. Editura Integral (an imprint of Editurile Universala), Bucharest (1998). ISBN 973-98272-2-5. ''See the [[Israil Bercovici|article on the author]] for further information.''</ref> This was only intensified as the rise of [[Romanticism]] amplified the sense of [[Nationalism|national identity]] across Europe generally. Thus, for example, members of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were generally non-religious, and one of the historical leaders of the Bund was the child of converts to [[Christianity]], though not a practicing or believing Christian himself.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The [[Haskalah]] combined with the [[Jewish Emancipation]] movement under way in Central and Western Europe to create an opportunity for Jews to enter secular society. At the same time, [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe provoked a surge of migration, in large part to the United States, where some 2 million Jewish immigrants resettled between 1880 and 1920.
By 1931, shortly before [[The Holocaust]], 92% of the World's Jewish population was Ashkenazi in origin. Secularism originated in Europe as series of movements that militated for a new, heretofore unheard-of concept called "secular Judaism". For these reasons, much of what is thought of by English-speakers and, to a lesser extent, by non-English-speaking Europeans as "secular Jewish culture" is, in essence, the Jewish cultural movement that evolved in Central and Eastern Europe, and subsequently brought to North America by immigrants.
During the 1940s, the Holocaust uprooted and destroyed most of the Jewish communities living in much of Europe. This, in combination with the [[History of the State of Israel|creation of the State of Israel]] and the consequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], resulted in a further geographic shift.

Defining secular culture among those who practice traditional Judaism is difficult, because the entire culture is, by definition, entwined with religious traditions: the idea of separate ethnic and religious identity is foreign to the Hebrew tradition of an ''" 'am yisrael"''. (This is particularly true for [[Orthodox Judaism]].) [[Gary Tobin]], head of the [[Institute for Jewish and Community Research]], said of traditional Jewish culture:
<blockquote>The dichotomy between religion and culture doesn’t really exist. Every religious attribute is filled with culture; every cultural act filled with religiosity. [[Synagogue]]s themselves are great centers of Jewish culture. After all, what is life really about? Food, relationships, enrichment … So is Jewish life. So many of our traditions inherently contain aspects of culture. Look at the [[Passover Seder]] — it's essentially great theater. Jewish education and religiosity bereft of culture is not as interesting.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/About_Jewish_Culture/JewishCulturalIdentity.htm The Emergence of a Jewish Cultural Identity], undated (2002 or later) on MyJewishLearning.com, reprinted from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. Accessed 11 February 2006.</ref></blockquote>

[[Yaakov Malkin]], Professor of Aesthetics and Rhetoric at [[Tel Aviv University]] and the founder and academic director of [[Meitar College for Judaism as Culture]]<ref>[http://www.meitar.org.il/HTMLs/home.aspx Meitar.org]</ref> in Jerusalem, writes:
<blockquote>Today very many [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] Jews take part in Jewish cultural activities, such as celebrating Jewish holidays as historical and nature festivals, imbued with new content and form, or marking life-cycle events such as birth, bar/bat mitzvah, marriage, and mourning in a secular fashion. They come together to study topics pertaining to Jewish culture and its relation to other cultures, in ''havurot'', cultural associations, and secular synagogues, and they participate in public and political action coordinated by secular Jewish movements, such as the former movement to free Soviet Jews, and movements to combat pogroms, discrimination, and religious coercion. Jewish secular [[humanism|humanistic]] education inculcates universal moral values through classic Jewish and world literature and through organizations for social change that aspire to ideals of justice and charity.<ref name="Malkin, Y p. 107">Malkin, Y. "Humanistic and secular Judaisms." ''Modern Judaism An Oxford Guide'', p. 107.</ref></blockquote>

In North America, the secular and cultural Jewish movements are divided into three umbrella organizations: the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] (SHJ), the [[Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations]] (CSJO), and [[Workmen's Circle]].

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Jewish Philosophy}}
{{See also|list of Jewish philosophers}}
[[File:Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[The Guide for the Perplexed]], [[Maimonides]] (circa 1190)]]
Jewish philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of Judaism. The Jewish philosophy is  extended over several main eras in [[Jewish history]], including the ancient and biblical era, medieval era and modern era (see [[Haskalah]]).
The ancient Jewish philosophy is expressed in the bible. According to Prof. Israel Efros the principles of the Jewish philosophy start in the [[bible]], where the foundations of the Jewish monotheistic beliefs can be found, such as the belief in [[Monotheism|one god]], the separation of god and the world and nature (as opposed to [[Pantheism]]) and the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]]. Other biblical writings that associated with philosophy are [[Psalms]] that contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current<ref>"Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition: In Islam, Judaism and Christianity" by John Inglis, Page 3</ref> and [[Ecclesiastes]] that is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.<ref>"Introduction to Philosophy" by Dr Tom Kerns</ref> Other writings related to philosophy can be found in the [[Deuterocanonical books]] such as [[Sirach]] and [[Book of Wisdom]].
During the [[Hellenistic era]], [[Hellenistic Judaism]] aspired to combine Jewish religious tradition with elements of Greek culture and philosophy. The philosopher [[Philo]] used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize [[Greek philosophy]] with Jewish philosophy. His work attempts to combine Plato and Moses into one philosophical system.<ref>{{cite web | first=Edward | last=Moore | date=June 28, 2005 | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/midplato/#SH6a | title=Middle Platonism - Philo of Alexandria | accessdate=December 20, 2012 | work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | issn=2161-0002}}</ref> He developed an allegoric approach of interpreting holy scriptures (the bible), in contrast to (old-fashioned) literally interpretation approaches. His allegorical [[exegesis]] was important for several Christian [[Church Fathers]] and some scholars hold that his concept of the [[Logos]] as God's creative principle influenced early [[Christology]]. Other scholars, however, deny direct influence but say both Philo and [[Early Christianity]] borrow from a common source.<ref>{{cite book | last=Keener | first= Craig S | title=The Gospel of John: A Commentary | location=Peabody, Mass. | publisher=Hendrickson | year=2003 | volume=1 | pages=343–347}}</ref>
[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|The opening page of Spinoza's magnum opus, ''[[Ethics (book)|Ethics]]'']]
Between the [[Ancient era]] and the [[Middle Ages]] most of the Jewish philosophy concentrated around the [[Rabbinic literature]] that is expressed in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. In the [[9th century]] [[Saadia Gaon]] wrote the text [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] which is the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the [[dogmas]] of Judaism. The [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]] included many influential Jewish philosophers such as [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] , [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Isaac Abravanel]], [[Nahmanides]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Nissim of Gerona]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Abraham bar Hiyya]], [[Joseph ibn Tzaddik]], [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Isaac ben Moses Arama]]. The Most notable is [[Maimonides]] who is considered, beside the Jewish world, as a prominent philosopher and polymath in the Islamic and Western worlds. Outside of Spain, other philosophers are [[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], [[Elia del Medigo]], [[Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi]] and [[Gersonides]].

Philosophy by Jews in [[Modern era]] was expressed by philosophers, mainly in Europe, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] founder of [[Spinozism]], whose work included modern [[Rationalism]] and [[Biblical criticism]] and laying the groundwork for the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=tws9907>{{cite news

A new era began in the 18th century with the thought of [[Moses Mendelssohn]].  Mendelssohn has been described as the "'third Moses,' with whom begins a new era in Judaism," just as new eras began with [[Moses|Moses the prophet]] and with [[Moses Maimonides]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=446&letter=M |title=Mendelssohn |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>  Mendelssohn was a [[German Jew]]ish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been "resistant to claim him as their spiritual father".<ref>Wein (1997), p. 44. ([http://books.google.com/books?id=11f9xBbOBBEC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=mendelssohn+%22father+of+reform+judaism%22&source=bl&ots=wSDAgIxKCN&sig=2lLe9ggyG2GDUlaK4SEV9EWjCvs&hl=en&ei=783dSqDTHM7N8QbrsZ1w&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=mendelssohn%20%22father%20of%20reform%20judaism%22&f=false Google books])</ref> Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both [[German people|Germans]] and Jews. The Jewish Enlightenment philosophy included [[Menachem Mendel Lefin]], [[Salomon Maimon]] and [[Isaac Satanow]]. The next [[century|19th century]] comprised both secular and religious philosophy and included philosophers such as [[Elijah Benamozegh]], [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Moses Hess]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], [[Samuel Hirsch]], [[Nachman Krochmal]], [[Samuel David Luzzatto]], [[Nachman of Breslov]] founder of [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] and [[Karl Marx]] founder of [[Marxist]] worldview. The [[20th century]] included the notable philosophers [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Henri Bergson]].

==Education and politics==
{{Main|Jewish education}}
{{See also|Jewish political movements|List of Jews in politics}}
A range of moral and political views is evident early in the history of Judaism, that serves to partially explain the diversity that is apparent among secular Jews who are often influenced by moral beliefs that can be found in Jewish scripture, and traditions. In recent centuries, secular Jews in Europe and the Americas have tended towards the liberal [[left-wing politics|political left]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, and played key roles in the birth of the 19th century's [[labor movement]] and [[socialism]]. While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Jewish views of religious pluralism|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]]. Some scholars<ref>Daniel J. Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/jud-democ.htm Judaism and Democracy: The Reality]. Undated. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Accessed 11 February 2006.</ref> attribute this to the fact that Jews are not expected to [[Missionary#Jewish missions|proselytize]], derived from [[Halakha]]. This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in diaspora countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed since [[Sanhedrin#Dissolution|363 CE]].

==Economic activity==
[[File:Portrait of David Ricardo by Thomas Phillips.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[David Ricardo]] (1772 - 1823). He was one of the most influential of the [[classical economics|classical economists]]<ref>Sowell, Thomas (2006). ''On classical economics''. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]].</ref><ref>http://www.policonomics.com/david-ricardo/</ref>]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], European laws prevented Jews from owning land and gave them powerful incentive to go into other professions that the indigenous Europeans were not willing to follow.<ref>The section on banking is drawn largely from the article [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=58&letter=U "Usury"] in the [[public domain]] ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901–1906).</ref> During the medieval period, there was a very strong social stigma against lending money and charging interest among the Christian majority. In most of Europe until the late 18th century, and in some places to an even later date, Jews were prohibited by [[Roman Catholic]] governments (and others) from owning land. On the other hand, the Church, because of a number of Bible verses (e.g., [[Leviticus]] 25:36) forbidding [[usury]], declared that charging any [[interest]] was against the divine law, and this prevented any mercantile use of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] by pious Christians. As the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] did not apply to Jews, they were not liable to the ecclesiastical punishments which were placed upon [[usury|usurers]] by the [[pope]]s. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having a class of men like the Jews who could supply capital for their use without being liable to [[excommunication]], and so the money trade of western Europe by this means fell into the hands of the Jews.

However, in almost every instance where large amounts were acquired by Jews through banking transactions the property thus acquired fell either during their life or upon their death into the hands of the king. This happened to [[Aaron of Lincoln]] in England, [[Ezmel de Ablitas]] in [[Navarre]], [[Heliot de Vesoul]] in [[Provence]], [[Benveniste de Porta]] in [[Aragon]], etc. It was often for this reason that kings supported the Jews, and even objected to them becoming Christians (because in that case they could not be forced to give up money won by usury). Thus, both in England and in France the kings demanded to be compensated for every Jew converted. This type of royal trickery was one factor in creating the stereotypical Jewish role of banker and/or merchant.

As a modern system of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] began to develop, loans became necessary for commerce and industry. Jews were able to gain a foothold in the new field of finance by providing these services: as non-Catholics, they were not bound by the ecclesiastical prohibition against "usury"; and in terms of Judaism itself, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] had long ago re-interpreted the Torah's ban on charging interest, allowing interest when it's needed to make a living.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The strong Jewish tradition of religious scholarship often left Jews well prepared for secular scholarship. In some times and places, this was countered by banning Jews from studying at [[university|universities]], or admitted them only in limited numbers (see [[Jewish quota]]). Over the centuries, Jews have been poorly represented among land-holding classes, but far better represented in academia, professions, finance, commerce and many scientific fields. The strong representation of Jews in science and academia is evidenced by the fact that 193 persons known to be Jews or of Jewish ancestry have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize]], accounting for 22% of all individual recipients worldwide between 1901 and 2014.<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/nobels.html Nobel Prize Laureates]</ref> Of whom, 26% in [[physics]], <ref>[http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Physics.html JEWISH NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS IN PHYSICS] at [http://www.jinfo.org/index.html JINFO.ORG]</ref> 22% in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]]<ref>[http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Chemistry.html JEWISH NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS IN CHEMISTRY] at [http://www.jinfo.org/index.html JINFO.ORG]</ref> and 27% in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>[http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Medicine.html JEWISH NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS IN PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINE] at [http://www.jinfo.org/index.html JINFO.ORG]</ref> In the fields of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], 31% of [[Turing Award]] recipients<ref>[http://www.jinfo.org/Computer_ACM_Turing.html JEWISH RECIPIENTS OF THE ACM A.M.

The early Jewish activity in science can be found in the [[Hebrew bible]] where some of the books contain descriptions of the [[physical world]]. [[Biblical cosmology]] provides sporadic glimpses that may be stitched together to form a Biblical impression of the physical universe. There have been comparisons between the Bible, with passages such as from the [[Genesis creation narrative]], and the astronomy of classical antiquity more generally.<ref>Kurtz, J. H., and T. D. Simonton. [http://books.google.com/books?id=BNk0AAAAMAAJ The Bible and Astronomy; An Exposition of the Biblical Cosmology, and Its Relations to Natural Science]. Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston, 1857.</ref> The Old Testament also contains various cleansing rituals. One suggested ritual, for example, deals with the proper procedure for cleansing a [[Tzaraath|leper]] ({{nasb|Leviticus|14:1-32|Leviticus 14:1-32}}). It is a fairly elaborate process, which is to be performed after a leper was already healed of leprosy ({{nasb|Leviticus|14:3|Leviticus 14:3}}), involving extensive cleansing and personal hygiene, but also includes sacrificing a bird and lambs with the addition of using their blood to symbolize that the afflicted has been cleansed.

The [[Torah]] proscribes [[Intercropping]] (Lev. 19:19, Deut 22:9), a practice often associated with sustainable agriculture and organic farming in modern [[agricultural science]].<ref>Andrews, D.J., A.H.

[[Albert Einstein]] was a German-born theoretical physicist and is considered as one of the most prominent scientists in history, often regarded as the "father of modern physics". His revolutionary work on the [[relativity theory]] transformed theoretical [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] during the 20th century. When first published, relativity superseded a 200-year-old [[Classical mechanics|theory of mechanics]] created primarily by [[Isaac Newton]].<ref name=relativity/><ref name=spacetime/><ref name=fitz-loren/>
In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of [[elementary particles]] and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the [[atomic age|nuclear age]]. With relativity, [[cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]] predicted extraordinary [[astronomy|astronomical phenomena]] such as [[neutron stars]], [[black holes]], and [[gravitational waves]].<ref name=relativity>{{Cite encyclopedia

Einstein formulated the well-known [[Mass–energy equivalence]], ''E = mc2'', and explained the [[photoelectric effect]]. His work also effected and influenced a large variety of fields of physics including the [[Big Bang]] theory (Einstein's [[General relativity]] influenced [[Georges Lemaître]]), [[Quantum mechanics]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]].

==Literature and poetry==

[[File:Foundation gnome.jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|''[[Foundation series]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]]'']]
In some places where there have been relatively high concentrations of Jews, distinct secular Jewish subcultures have arisen. For example, ethnic Jews formed an enormous proportion of the literary and artistic life of [[Vienna]], Austria at the end of the 19th century, or of New York City 50 years later (and Los Angeles in the mid-late 20th century). Many of these creative Jews were not particularly religious people. In general, Jewish artistic culture in various periods reflected the culture in which they lived.
[[File:Metamorphosis.jpg|170px|thumbnail|left|''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' by [[Franz Kafka]]]]
Literary and theatrical expressions of secular Jewish culture may be in specifically Jewish languages such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] or [[Ladino language|Ladino]], or it may be in the language of the surrounding cultures, such as English or [[German language|German]]. Secular literature and theater in Yiddish largely began in the 19th century and was in decline by the middle of the 20th century. The revival of Hebrew beyond its use in the liturgy is largely an early 20th-century phenomenon, and is closely associated with [[Zionism]]. Apart from the use of Hebrew in Israel, whether a Jewish community will speak a Jewish or non-Jewish language as its main vehicle of [[discourse]] is generally dependent on how isolated or assimilated that community is. For example, the Jews in the [[shtetls]] of Poland and the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City|New York]] during the early 20th century spoke [[Yiddish]] at most times, while assimilated Jews in 19th and early 20th-century Germany spoke German, and American-born Jews in the United States speak English.

Jewish authors have both created a unique [[Jewish literature]] and contributed to the national literature of many of the countries in which they live. Though not strictly secular, the Yiddish works of authors like [[Sholem Aleichem]] (whose collected works amounted to 28 volumes) and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (winner of the 1978 Nobel Prize), form their own canon, focusing on the Jewish experience in both Eastern Europe, and in America. In the United States, Jewish writers like [[Philip Roth]], [[Saul Bellow]], and many others are considered among the greatest American authors, and incorporate a distinctly secular Jewish view into many of their works. The poetry of [[Allen Ginsberg]] often touches on Jewish themes (notably the early autobiographical works such as ''[[Howl]]'' and ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]''). Other famous Jewish authors that made contributions to world literature include [[Heinrich Heine]], German poet, [[Mordecai Richler]], Canadian author, [[Isaac Babel]], Russian author, [[Franz Kafka]], of Prague, and [[Harry Mulisch]], whose novel ''[[The Discovery of Heaven]]'' was revealed by a 2007 poll as the "Best Dutch Book Ever".<ref name="Gulf Daily News">{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=290610|title=Leading Dutch writer Mulisch dies|date=1 November 2010|work=[[Gulf Daily News]]|accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>

In ''Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide'', [[Yaakov Malkin]], Professor of Aesthetics and Rhetoric at [[Tel Aviv University]] and the founder and academic director of [http://www.meitar.org.il/HTMLs/home.aspx Meitar College for Judaism as Culture] in Jerusalem, writes:

<blockquote>Secular Jewish culture embraces literary works that have stood the test of time as sources of aesthetic pleasure and ideas shared by Jews and non-Jews, works that live on beyond the immediate socio-cultural context within which they were created. They include the writings of such Jewish authors as [[Sholem Aleichem]], [[Itzik Manger]], [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[S.Y. Agnon]], [[Isaac Babel]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Haim Nahman Bialik]], [[Yehuda Amichai]], [[Amos Oz]], [[A.B. Yehoshua]], and [[David Grossman]].

[[Hebrew poetry (disambiguation)|Hebrew poetry]] is expressed by various of poets in different eras of Jewish history. [[Biblical poetry]] is related to the poetry in biblical times as it expressed in the [[Hebrew bible]] and Jewish sacred texts. In medieval times the Jewish poetry was mainly expressed by [[piyyut]]im and several poets such as [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Dunash ben Labrat]]. [[Modern Hebrew poetry]] is mostly related to the era of and after the [[revival of the Hebrew language]], pioneered by [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in the [[Haskalah]] era and succeeded by poets such as [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]], [[Nathan Alterman]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].

==Theatre==
{{Main|Jewish theatre (disambiguation)}}

===Yiddish theatre===
{{Main|Yiddish theatre}}
[[File:HANA ROVINA THE DYBBUK 1920.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[Hana Rovina]] in [[The Dybbuk]] (1920), a play by [[S. Ansky]]]]
The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Jew [[Abraham Goldfaden]] founded the first professional [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] theatre troupe in [[Iași]], [[Romania]] in 1876. The next year, his troupe achieved enormous success in 
[[Bucharest]]. Within a decade, Goldfaden and others brought Yiddish theater to Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Germany, New York City, and other cities with significant [[Ashkenazi]]c populations. Between 1890 and 1940, over a dozen Yiddish theatre groups existed in New York City alone, in the [[Yiddish Theater District]], performing original [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], and Yiddish translations of theatrical works and [[opera]]. Perhaps the most famous of Yiddish-language plays is ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' (1919) by [[Shloime Ansky|S. Ansky]].

Yiddish theater in New York in the early 20th century rivalled English-language theater in quantity and often surpassed it in quality. A 1925 ''[[New York Times]]'' article remarks, "…Yiddish theater… is now a stable American institution and no longer dependent on immigration from Eastern Europe. People who can neither speak nor write Yiddish attend Yiddish stage performances and pay [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] prices on [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]]." This article also mentions other aspects of a New York Jewish cultural life "in full flower" at that time, among them the fact that the extensive New York Yiddish-language press of the time included seven daily newspapers.<ref>Melamed, S.M., "The Yiddish Stage", ''New York Times'', September 27, 1925 (X2).</ref>

In fact, however, the next generation of American Jews spoke mainly English to the exclusion of Yiddish; they brought the artistic energy of Yiddish theater into the American theatrical mainstream, but usually in a less specifically Jewish form.

Yiddish theater, most notably [[Moscow State Jewish Theater]] directed by [[Solomon Mikhoels]], also played a prominent role in the arts scene of the Soviet Union until Stalin's 1948 reversal in government policy toward the Jews. (See [[Rootless cosmopolitan]], [[Night of the Murdered Poets]].)

Montreal's [[Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre]] continues to thrive after 50 years of performance.

===European theatre===
[[File:An-ski 1910.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|[[S. Ansky]], 1910]]
From their [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]] to World War II, Jews were very active and sometimes even dominant in certain forms of European theatre, and after the [[Holocaust]] many Jews continued to that cultural form. For example, in pre-Nazi Germany, where [[Nietzsche]] asked "What good actor of today is not Jewish?", acting, directing and writing positions were often filled by Jews. Both MacDonald and Jewish Tribal Review would generally be counted as anti-Semitic sources, but reasonably careful in their factual claims. "In Imperial Berlin, Jewish artists could be found in the forefront of the performing arts, from high drama to more popular forms like [[cabaret]] and [[revue]], and eventually film. Jewish audiences patronized innovative theater, regardless of whether they approved of what they saw."<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/content/exhibitions/special/berlin/berlin_cabaret.html Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890–1918], on the site of The Jewish Museum, New York. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> The British historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], commenting on Jewish contributions to European culture at the [[Fin de siècle]], writes that
<blockquote>The area where Jewish influence was strongest was the theatre, especially in Berlin. Playwrights like [[Carl Sternheim]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Erwin Piscator]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Ferenc Molnár]] and [[Carl Zuckmayer]], and influential producers like [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]], appeared at times to dominate the stage, which tended to be modishly [[left-wing]], [[Republicanism|pro-republican]], experimental and sexually daring. But it was certainly not revolutionary, and it was cosmopolitan rather than Jewish.<ref>Johnson, Paul (1987). ''A History of the Jews'', pg. 479. New York: Harper Perennial. – Erwin Piscator was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Protestant]] ([[Nazi Party|Nazi]] propagandists had claimed since 1927 that he was a “Jewish Bolshevik”, though).</ref></blockquote>
Jews also made similar, if not as massive, contributions to theatre and drama in Austria, Britain, France, and Russia (in the national languages of those countries). Jews in Vienna, Paris and German cities found [[cabaret]] both a popular and effective means of expression, as German cabaret in the [[Weimar Republic]] "was mostly a Jewish art form".<ref>Suzanne Weiss, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/4555/format/html/displaystory.html Jewish cabaret singer brings songs of Berlin to Berkeley], ''The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California'', September 27, 1996. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> The involvement of Jews in Central European theatre was halted during the rise of the Nazis and the purging of Jews from cultural posts, though many emigrated to [[Western Europe]] or the United States and continued working there.

[[File:Neil Simon - 1974.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[Neil Simon]]]]
Yiddish theatre fed into the mainstream of American stage and film acting: the [[method acting]] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] found its way to America through [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]]; Adler's daughter [[Stella Adler|Stella]] and son [[Luther Adler|Luther]] were instrumental in the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], two of whose three founders were also Jews. The list of Stella Adler's and Group Theatre founder [[Lee Strasberg]]'s students, mostly Gentiles, reads like a ''Who's Who'' of American acting: [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[James Dean]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Eva Marie Saint]], to name just a few. Similarly, what Jewish composer [[John Kander]] calls an "interesting phenomenon that [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]] composers like [[Jerome Kern]], [[George Gershwin]] and [[Marc Blitzstein]] are [[Secular Jewish culture#American English-language theatre|predominantly Jewish]]" comes from "the tradition established from New York's Yiddish theater."<ref>Keith D.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries the European [[operetta]], a precursor the musical, often featured the work of Jewish composers such as [[Paul Abraham (composer)|Paul Abraham]], [[List of operettas|Leo Ascher]], [[List of Austrian Jews#Composers|Edmund Eysler]], [[List of Austrian Jews#Musicians|Leo Fall]], [[List of operettas#Bruno Granichstaedten|Bruno Granichstaedten]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Emmerich Kalman]], [[Sigmund Romberg]], [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]] and [[Rudolf Friml]]; the latter four eventually moved to the United States and produced their works on the New York stage. One of the [[libretto|librettists]] for [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' (not an operetta proper but rather a work of the earlier [[Opéra comique]] form) was the Jewish [[Ludovic Halévy]], niece of composer [[Fromental Halévy]] (Bizet himself was not Jewish but he married the elder Halevy's daughter, many have suspected that he was the descendant of Jewish converts to Christianity, and others have noticed Jewish-sounding intervals in his music).<ref>Raphael Mostel, [http://www.forward.com/main/article.php?ref=mostel200405051021 Carmen Comes Home], ''[[The Forward]]'', May 7, 2004. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> The Viennese librettist Victor Leon summarized the connection of Jewish composers and writers with the form of operetta: "The audience for operetta wants to laugh beneath tears—and that is exactly what Jews have been doing for the last two thousand years since the destruction of Jerusalem".<ref>Dr. Kenneth Libo Ph. D and Michael Skakun, [http://www.cjh.org/about/Forward/view_Forward.cfm?Forwardid=27 The Persecution of Creativity: Jews, Music and Vienna], Center for Jewish History, April 16, 2004. Accessed 12 February 2006</ref> Another factor in the evolution of musical theatre was [[vaudeville]], and during the early 20th century the form was explored and expanded by Jewish comedians and actors such as [[Jack Benny]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[The Marx Brothers]], [[Anna Held]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Molly Picon]], [[Sophie Tucker]] and [[Ed Wynn]]. During the period when Broadway was monopolized by [[revues]] and similar entertainments, Jewish producer [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] dominated the theatrical scene with his [[Ziegfeld Follies|Follies]].

By 1910 Jews (the vast majority of them immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]) already composed a quarter of the population of New York City, and almost immediately Jewish artists and intellectuals began to show their influence on the cultural life of that city, and through time, the country as a whole. Likewise, while the modern musical can best be described as a fusion of operetta, earlier American entertainment and [[African-American]] culture and music, as well as Jewish culture and music, the actual authors of the first "book musicals" were the Jewish [[Jerome Kern]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Morrie Ryskind]]. From that time until the 1980s a vast majority of successful musical theatre composers, lyricists, and book-writers were Jewish (a notable exception is the Protestant [[Cole Porter]], who acknowledged that the reason he was so successful on Broadway was that he wrote what he called "Jewish music").<ref>Michael Billig, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/AmericanJewishMusicTO/ShowTunes.htm Creating the American Musical].

Since the [[Tony Award for Best Original Score]] was instituted in 1947, approximately 70% of nominated scores and 60% of winning scores were by Jewish composers. Of successful British and French musical writers both in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway, [[Claude-Michel Schönberg]] and [[Lionel Bart]] are Jewish, among others.
[[File:Strasberg Teaching.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[Lee Strasberg]]]]
One explanation of the affinity of Jewish composers and playwrights to the musical is that "traditional [[Jewish music|Jewish religious music]] was most often led by a single singer, a [[Hazzan|cantor]] while [[Christianity|Christians]] emphasize choral singing."<ref>Jacob Baron, [http://www.machar.org/bm_jbaron.html Jewish Composers], ''Machar, The Washington Congregation for Secular Humanistic Judaism'', June 2, 2005.

Many of these writers used the musical to explore issues relating to [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], the acceptance of the outsider in society, the racial situation in the United States, the overcoming of obstacles through perseverance, and other topics pertinent to Jewish Americans and Western Jews in general, often using subtle and disguised stories to get this point across.<ref>Alan Gomberg, [http://www.talkinbroadway.com/rialto/past/2004/02_16_04.html ''op. cit.'']</ref> For example, Kern, Rodgers, Hammerstein, the Gershwins, [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]] wrote musicals and operas aiming to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urging racial harmony; these works included ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and ''[[The King and I]]''. Towards the end of Golden Age, writers also began to openly and overtly tackle Jewish subjects and issues, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[Rags (musical)|Rags]]''; Bart's ''[[Blitz!]]'' also tackles relations between Jews and Gentiles. [[Jason Robert Brown]] and [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' is a sensitive exploration of both [[anti-Semitism]] and historical American [[racism]]. The original concept that became ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' was set in the [[Lower East Side]] during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].<ref>Arthur Laurents, [http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&AssetID=18 Theater: West Side Story; The Growth of an Idea], ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', August 4, 1957.

Jewish playwrights have also contributed to non-musical drama and theatre, both Broadway and regional. [[Edna Ferber]], [[Moss Hart]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Neil Simon]] are only some of the prominent Jewish playwrights in American theatrical history. Approximately 21% of the plays and musicals that have won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] were written and composed by Jewish Americans.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Hebrew and Israeli theatre===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 14066 Habimaquot; Theatre.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Habima]] theater, 2011]]
The earliest known [[Hebrew language]] drama was written around 1550 by a [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish-Italian]] writer from [[Mantua]].<ref>Shimon Levy, [http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=199 The Development of Israeli Theatre– a brief overview]. Credited to Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem, 2000. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> A few works were written by [[rabbis]] and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] in the 17th century [[Amsterdam]], where Jews were relatively free from persecution and had both flourishing religious and secular Jewish cultures.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&letter=D Jewishencyclopedia.com], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. ''Could not access 12 February 2006.''</ref> All of these early Hebrew plays were about Biblical or mystical subjects, often in the form of [[Talmud]]ic [[parable]]s. During the post-Emancipation period in 19th-century Europe, many Jews translated great [[History of theatre#Western theatre history|European plays]] such as those by [[Shakespeare]], [[Molière]] and [[Schiller]], giving the characters Jewish names and transplanting the plot and setting to within a Jewish context.

Modern Hebrew theatre and drama, however, began with the development of [[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Modern Hebrew]] in Europe (the first Hebrew theatrical ''professional performance'' was in Moscow in 1918)<ref>Shimon Levy, [http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=199 ''op. cit.'']</ref> and was "closely linked with the Jewish national renaissance movement of the twentieth century. The historical awareness and the sense of primacy which accompanied the Hebrew theatre in its early years dictated the course of its artistic and aesthetic development".<ref>Orna Ben-Meir, [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/publications/ASSAPHTH11/BEN-MEIR.html Biblical Thematics in Stage Design for the Hebrew Theatre], ''Assaph'', Section C, no. 11 (July 1999), p. 141 ''et. seq.''. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> These traditions were soon transplanted to [[Culture of Israel#Film and theatre|Israel]]. Playwrights such as [[Natan Alterman]], [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]], [[Leah Goldberg]], [[Ephraim Kishon]], [[Hanoch Levin]], [[Aharon Megged]], [[Moshe Shamir]], [[Avraham Shlonsky]], [[Yehoshua Sobol]] and [[A. B. Yehoshua]] have written Hebrew-language plays. Themes that are obviously common in these works are the [[Shoah|Holocaust]], the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], the meaning of Jewishness, and contemporary secular-religious tensions within Jewish Israel. The most well-known Hebrew theatre company and Israel's national theatre is the [[Habima Theater|Habima]] (meaning "the stage" in Hebrew), which was formed in 1913 in [[Lithuania]], and re-established in 1917 in Russia; another prominent Israeli theatre company is the [[Cameri Theater|Cameri Theatre]], which is "Israel's first and leading repertory theatre".<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hebrewtheatre/history.html&date=2009-10-25+23:49:21 History of Israeli Theatre], on a [[Geocities]] site, credits [http://www.habima.org.il habima.org.il] and [http://www.cameri.co.il cameri.co.il].</ref>

[[File:Satz His Wifes Lover.jpg|frame|Poster for ''[[His Wife's Lover]]'' (1931), starring [[Ludwig Satz]]]]
In the era when Yiddish theatre was still a major force in the world of theatre, over 100 films were made in Yiddish. Many are now lost. Prominent films included ''[[Shulamith (1931 film)|Shulamith]]'' (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film ''[[His Wife's Lover]]'' (1931), ''[[A Daughter of Her People]]'' (1932), the anti-Nazi film ''[[Wandering Jew|The Wandering Jew]]'' (1933), ''The [[Yiddish King Lear (film)|Yiddish King Lear]]'' (1934), ''[[Shir Hashirim (film)|Shir Hashirim]]'' (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time ''[[Yidl Mitn Fidl]]'' (1936), ''[[Where Is My Child?]]'' (1937), ''[[Green Fields]]'' (1937), ''[[The Dybbuk (play)|Dybuk]]'' (1937), ''[[The Singing Blacksmith]]'' (1938), ''[[Tevya (film)|Tevya]]'' (1939), ''[[Mirele Efros]]'' (1939), ''[[Lang ist der Weg]]'' (1948), and ''[[God, Man and Devil]]'' (1950).

The roster of Jewish entrepreneurs in the English-language American film industry is legendary: [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], [[the Warner Brothers]], [[David O. Selznick]], [[Marcus Loew]], and [[Adolph Zukor]], [[William Fox (producer)|Fox]] to name just a few, and continuing into recent times with such industry giants as super-agent [[Michael Ovitz]], [[Michael Eisner]], [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Steven Spielberg]], and [[David Geffen]]. However, few of these brought a specifically Jewish sensibility either to the art of film or, with the sometime exception of Spielberg, to their choice of subject matter. The historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] described the situation as follows:<ref>{{citation|title=Interesting Times : A Twentieth-Century Life
|last=Hobsbawm|first= E. J.|publisher= Knopf Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn= 9780375422348|pages=10–11}}</ref>
{{quote|It would be ... pointless to look for consciously Jewish elements in the songs of Irving Berlin or the Hollywood movies of the era of the great studios, all of which were run by immigrant Jews: their object, in which they succeeded, was precisely to make songs or films which found a specific expression for 100 per cent Americanness.}}

A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Mel Brooks]], or [[Woody Allen]]; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the [[Barbra Streisand]] vehicle ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' (1983), or [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[The Fixer (film)|The Fixer]]'' (1968).

==Radio and television==
The first radio chains, the [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] and the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], were created by the [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] [[David Sarnoff]] and [[William S. Paley]], respectively. These Jewish innovators were also among the first producers of televisions, both black-and-white and [[color television|color]].<ref>Johnson, ''op. cit.' p. 462-463.</ref> Among the Jewish immigrant communities of America there was also a thriving [[Yiddish language]] radio, with its "golden age" from the 1930s to the 1950s.

Although there is little specifically Jewish television in the United States ([[National Jewish Television]], largely religious, broadcasts only three hours a week), Jews have been involved in American television from its earliest days. From [[Sid Caesar]] and [[Milton Berle]] to [[Joan Rivers]], [[Gilda Radner]], and [[Andy Kaufman]] to [[Billy Crystal]] to [[Jerry Seinfeld]], Jewish stand-up comedians have been icons of American television. Other Jews that held a prominent role in early radio and television were [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Walter Winchell]] and [[David Susskind]]. More figures are [[Larry King]], [[Michael Savage]] and [[Howard Stern]]. In the analysis of Paul Johnson, "The Broadway musical, radio and TV were all examples of a fundamental principle in [[Jewish diaspora]] history: Jews opening up a completely new field in business and culture, a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' on which to set their mark, before other interests had a chance to take possession, erect [[guild]] or [[professional]] fortifications and deny them entry."<ref>Johnson, ''op. cit.'' p. 462-463.</ref>

One of the first televised [[situation comedy|situation comedies]], ''[[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]]'' was set in a specifically Jewish milieu in [[the Bronx]]. While the overt Jewish milieu of ''The Goldbergs'' was unusual for an American television series, there were a few other examples, such as ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993) and [[Bridget Loves Bernie]]. Jews have also played an enormous role among the creators and writers of television comedies: [[Woody Allen]], [[Mel Brooks]], [[Selma Diamond]], [[Larry Gelbart]], [[Carl Reiner]], and [[Neil Simon]] all wrote for Sid Caesar; Reiner's son [[Rob Reiner]] worked with [[Norman Lear]] on ''[[All in the Family]]'' (which often engaged [[anti-semitism]] and other issues of [[prejudice]]); [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] created the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[Lorne Michaels]], [[Al Franken]], [[Rosie Shuster]], and [[Alan Zweibel]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' breathed new life into the [[variety show]] in the 1970s.

More recently, American Jews have been instrumental to "novelistic" television series such as ''[[The Wire]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Variously acclaimed as one of the greatest television series of all time, ''The Wire'' was created by [[David Simon]]. Simon also served as executive producer, head writer, and [[show runner]]. [[Matthew Weiner]] produced the fifth and sixth seasons of ''The Sopranos'' and later created ''[[Mad Men]]''.
More remarkable contributors are [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], creators of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' TV series; [[Ron Leavitt]] co-creator of ''[[Married... with Children]]''; [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[J. J. Abrams]], co-creators of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''; [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], creators of ''[[Friends]]''; [[Tim Kring]] creator of ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''; [[Sydney Newman]] co-creator of ''[[Doctor Who]]''; [[Darren Star]], creator ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Melrose Place]]''; [[Aaron Spelling]] co-creator of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''; [[Chuck Lorre]], co-creator of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''; [[Gideon Raff]], creator of ''[[Prisoners of War (TV series)|Prisoners of War]]'' which ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' is based on; [[Aaron Ruben]] and [[Sheldon Leonard]] co-creators of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''; [[Don Hewitt]] creator of ''[[60 Minutes]]''; [[Garry Shandling]], co-creator of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''; [[Ed. Weinberger]], co-creator of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''; [[David Milch]], creator of ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''; [[Steven Levitan]], co-creator of ''[[Modern Family]]''; [[Dick Wolf]], creator of ''[[Law & Order]]''; [[David Shore]], creator ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''; [[Max Mutchnick]] and [[David Kohan]] creators of ''[[Will & Grace]]''. There is also a significant role of Jews in acting by actors such as [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[William Shatner]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[David Duchovny]], [[Fred Savage]], [[Zach Braff]], [[Noah Wyle]], [[Adam Brody]], [[Katey Sagal]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Mayim Bialik]].

==Music==
{{Main|Jewish music}}
{{see also|Secular Jewish music}}
Jewish musical contributions also tend to reflect the cultures of the countries in which Jews live, the most notable examples being [[European classical music|classical]] and [[popular music]] in the United States and Europe. ''(See: [[Secular Jewish Music and Dance#Jews in classical music|Jews in Classical Music]] and [[Secular Jewish Music and Dance#Jews in mainstream and jazz music|Jews in Mainstream and Jazz]])''. Some music, however, is unique to particular Jewish communities, such as [[Music of Israel|Israeli music]], [[Israeli folk|Israeli Folk music]], [[Klezmer]], [[Sephardic music|Sephardic and Ladino music]], and [[Mizrahi music]].

==Dance==
{{Main|Jewish dance}}
Deriving from Biblical traditions, Jewish dance has long been used by Jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions. Each [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish diasporic]] community developed its own dance traditions for wedding celebrations and other distinguished events. For [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in [[Eastern Europe]], for example, dances, whose names corresponded to the different forms of [[klezmer]] music that were played, were an obvious staple of the wedding ceremony of the [[shtetl]]. Jewish dances both were influenced by surrounding [[Gentile]] traditions and Jewish sources preserved over time. "Nevertheless the Jews practiced a corporeal expressive language that was highly differentiated from that of the non-Jewish peoples of their neighborhood, mainly through motions of the hands and arms, with more intricate legwork by the younger men."<ref>[http://borzykowski.users.ch/EnglYidDance.htm Yiddish, Klezmer, Ashkenazic or 'shtetl' dances], Le Site Genevois de la Musique Klezmer. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> In general, however, in most religiously traditional communities, members of the opposite sex dancing together or dancing at times other than at these events was frowned upon.

==Humor==
{{Main|Jewish humor}}
[[Jewish humor]] is the long tradition of humor in Judaism dating back to the [[Torah]] and the [[Midrash]], but generally refers to the more recent stream of verbal, frequently self-deprecating and often anecdotal humor originating in Eastern Europe. Jewish humor took root in the United States over the last hundred years, beginning with [[vaudeville]], and continuing through radio, stand-up, film, and television. A significant number of American comedians have been or are Jewish.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Compared to music or theater, there is less of a specifically Jewish tradition in the [[visual arts]]. The most likely and accepted reason is that, as has been previously shown with Jewish music and literature, before [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]] Jewish culture was dominated by the [[Aniconism in Judaism|religious tradition of aniconism]].

A Jewish tradition of [[illuminated manuscript]]s in at least [[Late Antiquity]] has left no survivors, but can be deduced from borrowings in Early Medieval Christian art. A number of luxury pieces of [[Zwischengoldglas|gold glass]] from the later Roman period have Jewish motifs.  Several [[Hellenistic]]-style floor [[mosaic]]s have also been excavated in synagogues from Late Antiquity in Israel and Palestine, especially of the [[signs of the Zodiac]], which was apparently acceptable in a low-status position on the floor. Some, such as that at [[Naaran]], show evidence of a reaction against images of living creatures around 600 CE.  The decoration of [[sarcophagi]] and walls at the cave cemetery at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Beit She'arim]] shows a mixture of Jewish and Hellenistic motifs. However for a period of several centuries between about 700 and 1100 CE there are scarely any survivals of identifiably Jewish art.

[[Jews in the Middle Ages|Middle Age]] [[Rabbinical literature|Rabbinical]] and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature also contain textual and graphic art, most famously illuminated haggadahs such as the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]], and other manuscripts like the [[Nuremberg Mahzor]].  Some of these were illustrated by Jewish artists and some by Christians; equally some Jewish artists and craftsmen in various media worked on Christian commissions.<ref>Roza Bieliauskiene and Felix Tarm, [http://www.artcult.fr/_Peintures/Fiche/art-0-1310482.htm Brief History of Jewish Art], Jewish Art Network. Accessed January 14, 2010.</ref> Johnson again summarizes this sudden change from a limited participation by Jews in visual art (as in many other arts) to a large movement by them into this branch of European cultural life:
<blockquote>Again, the arrival of the Jewish artist was a strange phenomenon. It is true that, over the centuries, there had been many animals (though few humans) depicted in Jewish art: lions on [[Torah]] curtains, owls on Judaic coins, animals on the [[Capernaum]] capitals, birds on the rim of the fountain-basis in the 5th century [[Naro]] [[synagogue]] in [[Tunis]]; there were carved animals, too, on timber synagogues in [[eastern Europe]] - indeed the Jewish [[woodcarving|wood-carver]] was the prototype of the modern Jewish [[Plastic arts|plastic artist]]. A book of Yiddish folk-[[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], printed at [[Vitebsk]] in 1920, was similar to Chagall's own [[bestiary]]. But the resistance of pious Jews to portraying the living human image was still strong at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>Johnson, ''op.cit.'', p. 411.</ref></blockquote>
[[File:Revolutionary Romania by C D Rosenthal.jpg|180px|thumbnail|''Revolutionary Romania'' (portrait of [[Maria Rosetti]]) by [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]] (1848)]]
There were few Jewish ''secular'' artists in Europe prior to the [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]] that spread throughout Europe with the Napoleonic conquests. There were exceptions, and [[Salomon Adler]] was a prominent portrait painter in 18th century [[Milan]]. The delay in participation in the visual arts parallels the lack of Jewish participation in European classical music until the nineteenth century, and which was progressively overcome with the rise of [[Modernism (art)|Modernism]] in the 20th century. There were many Jewish artists in the 19th century, but Jewish artistic activity boomed during the end of World War I. The Jewish artistic Renaissance has its roots in the 1901 Fifth Zionist Congress, which included an art exhibition featuring Jewish artists E.M. Lilien and Hermann Struck.  The exhibition helped legitimize art as an expression of Jewish culture.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/kiev/expressions/about.htm Artistic Expressions of the Jewish Renaissance]</ref> According to Nadine Nieszawer, "Until 1905, Jews were always plunged into their books but from the first Russian Revolution, they became emancipated, committed themselves in politics and became artists.

Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref>  Individual Jews figured in the modern artistic movements of Europe— With the exception of those living in isolated Jewish communities, most Jews listed here as contributing to secular Jewish culture also participated in the cultures of the peoples they lived with and nations they lived in. In most cases, however, the work and lives of these people did not exist in two distinct cultural spheres but rather in one that incorporated elements of both.

During the early 20th century Jews figured particularly prominently in the [[Montparnasse]] movement, and after World War II among the [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionists]]: [[Alexander Bogen]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Al Held]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Louis Schanker]] as well as among [[List of contemporary artists|Contemporary artists]], [[List of modern artists|Modernists]] and [[Postmodern art|Postmodernists]].<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/artists.html Jewish Artists], Jewish Virtual Library, 2005. Accessed 12 February 2006.</ref> Many [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]] were prominent in the art of [[scenic design]], particularly the aforementioned Chagall and Aronson, as well as the revolutionary [[Léon Bakst]], who like the other two also painted. One [[List of Mexican Jews|Mexican Jewish]] artist was [[Pedro Friedeberg]]; historians disagree as to whether [[Frida Kahlo]]'s father was Jewish or Lutheran. [[Gustav Klimt]] was not Jewish, but nearly all of his patrons and several of his models were. Among major artists Chagall may be the most specifically Jewish in his themes. But as art fades into [[graphic design]], Jewish names and themes become more prominent: [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Al Hirschfeld]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Art Spiegelman]] and [[Saul Steinberg]].

Jews have also played a very important role in medias other than painting; in photography some notable figures are [[André Kertész]], [[Robert Frank]], [[Helmut Newton]], [[Garry Winogrand]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Steve Lehman]],<ref>[http://www.foto8.com/issue02/tibetans2.html foto8.com], John Levy, "Review of The Tibetans", photo 8, [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1884167365 amazon.com], Lehman, Steve, The Tibetans: A Struggle to Survive (New York: How Town / Umbrage), 1998.</ref> and [[Adi Nes]]; in installation art and street art some notable figures are [[Sigalit Landau]],<ref>See: Ohad Meromi in the online exhibition "Real Time" <http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.html>.</ref> [[Dede (artist)|Dede]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Boulos|first=Nick|title=Show and Tel Aviv: Israel's artistic coastal city|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/middle-east/show-and-tel-aviv-israels-artistic-coastal-city-8861131.html|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 October 2013}}</ref> and [[Michal Rovner]].

Graphic art, as expressed in the art of comics, has been a key field for Jewish artists as well. In the [[golden age of comics|Golden]] and [[silver age of comics|Silver ages]] of American comic books, the Jewish role was overwhelming and large number of the medium's foremost creators have been Jewish.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Comic Books">{{cite book |last=Booker|first=M.

== Cuisine ==
{{Main|Jewish cuisine}}
Jewish [[cooking]] combines the food of many cultures in which Jews have settled, including Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Spanish, German and Eastern European styles of cooking, all influenced by the need for food to be [[kosher]]. Thus, "Jewish" foods like [[bagels]], [[hummus]], [[stuffed cabbage]], and [[blintz]]es all come from various other cultures. The amalgam of these foods, plus uniquely Jewish contributions like [[tzimmis]], [[cholent]], [[gefilte fish]] and [[matzah ball]]s, make up Jewish cuisine.
