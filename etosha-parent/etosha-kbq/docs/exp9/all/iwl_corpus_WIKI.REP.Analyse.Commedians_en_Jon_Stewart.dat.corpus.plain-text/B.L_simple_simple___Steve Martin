'''Stephen Glenn Martin''' (born August 14, 1945) is an [[Americans|American]] [[comedian]] and [[actor]].

== Early years ==
Martin was born in [[Waco, Texas]] to Glenn Vernon Martin, a [[real estate]] [[salesman]] and aspiring actor, and Mary Lee Stewart, a housewife. Martin was raised in [[Inglewood, California]] and [[Garden Grove, California]]. He is of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.

As a teenager, Martin started out working at the [[Magic Shop]] at [[Disneyland]]. There he developed his talents for [[magic]], [[Juggle|juggling]], playing the [[banjo]] and creating [[balloon]] [[animal]]s. He teamed up with friend and [[Garden Grove High School]] classmate Kathy Westmoreland to do a musical comedy routine. They [[perform]]ed at local [[coffee house]]s and at the [[Bird Cage Theater]] in [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. Martin attended [[Santa Ana College]] at the same time as [[actor|actress]] [[Diane Keaton]].

Martin [[Academic major|majored]] in [[philosophy]] at [[California State University]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], but dropped out. His time there changed his life:

"It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about [[non sequitur]]s appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying logic, and they were talking about cause and effect, and you start to realize, 'Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything!' Then it gets real easy to write this stuff, because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the punch line, you twist the non sequitur so hard away from the things that set it up, that it's easy... and it's thrilling."
 
Martin's girlfriend in 1967 was a [[dancer]] on ''[[Smothers Brothers|The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''. She helped Martin get a [[write|writing]] [[job]] with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams. Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an [[Emmy Award]] in 1969. Martin also wrote for [[John Denver]] (a neighbor of his in [[Aspen, Colorado]] at one point), [[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]], and [[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]. He also appeared on these shows and several others, in various [[comedy skit]]s.

Martin also performed his own material, sometimes as an [[opening act]] for groups such as [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] and [[The Carpenters]]. He appeared at [[San Francisco]]'s [[The Boarding House]] among other places. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on [[Van Dyke and Company]] in 1976.

== Fame ==
In the mid-1970s, he made appearances as a [[stand up]] comedian on [[The Tonight Show|The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]. That exposure, together with appearances on [[HBO]]'s [[On Location]] and [[NBC]]'s [[Saturday Night Live]] (SNL) led to his first of four [[comedy]] [[album]]s, ''Let's Get Small''. The album was a huge success.

His next album, ''A Wild and Crazy Guy'', was a bigger success. It reached the #2 spot on the sales chart in the [[United States]]. It created a [[catch phrase]] (the album's title). It was based on an SNL skit in which Martin and [[Dan Aykroyd]] played a couple of bumbling [[Czechoslovakia]]n [[playboy]]s. The album was a million seller.

Both albums won [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] for [[Best Comedy Recording]] in 1977 and 1978 respectively.
