'''''New York''''' is a bi-weekly magazine concerned with life, culture, politics, and style generally, and with a particular emphasis on [[New York City]].  Founded by [[Milton Glaser]] and [[Clay Felker]] in 1968 as a competitor to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', it was brasher and less polite, and established itself as a cradle of [[New Journalism]].<ref>Wolfe, Tom. (1972-02-14) [http://nymag.com/news/media/47353/ Tom Wolfe Gives an Eyewitness Report of the Birth of 'The New Journalism' - New York Magazine]. Nymag.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.</ref> Over time, it became more national in scope, publishing many noteworthy articles on American culture by writers such as [[Tom Wolfe]], [[Jimmy Breslin]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Frank Rich]], and [[John Heilemann]].

In its current incarnation under editor-in-chief [[Adam Moss]], "The nation's best and most-imitated city magazine is often not about the city—at least not in the overcrowded, traffic-clogged, five-boroughs sense", wrote then ''Washington Post'' media critic [[Howard Kurtz]], as the magazine has increasingly published political and cultural stories of national significance.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/06/AR2009120602395.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Bright lights, bigger city at ''New York'' Magazine | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | date=December 7, 2009}}</ref>

Since its redesign and relaunch in 2004, the magazine has won more [[National Magazine Awards]] than any other publication, which includes the 2013 award for Magazine of the Year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/business/new-york-receives-national-magazine-awards-top-prize.html | work=The New York Times | first=Christine | last=Haughney | title=New York Receives National Magazine Awards' Top Prize | date=May 2, 2013}}</ref> It was one of the first city magazines and one of the first dual-audience "[[lifestyle magazine]]s", and its format and style have been emulated by some other American regional city publications.

In 2009, its paid and verified circulation was 408,622, with 95.8% of that coming from subscriptions. Its websites—NYmag.com, Vulture.com, The Cut, and Grub Street—receive visits from more than 14 million users per month.<ref>Bhuiyan, Johana.

==History==

===1960s===
''New York'' began life in 1963 as the Sunday-magazine supplement of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' newspaper.  Edited by [[Clay Felker]], the magazine showcased the work of several talented Tribune contributors, including [[Tom Wolfe]], [[Barbara Goldsmith]], and [[Jimmy Breslin]].<ref name="la times">{{cite news |first= Dennis|last= Mclellan| title=Clay Felker, 82; editor of New York magazine led New Journalism charge  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/02/local/me-felker2 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=November 23, 2008 }}</ref> Soon after the ''Tribune'' went out of business in 1966–67, Felker and his partner, [[Milton Glaser]], purchased the rights with money loaned to them by C. Gerald Goldsmith (Barbara Goldsmith's husband at the time), and reincarnated the magazine as a stand-alone glossy. Joining them was managing editor Jack Nessel, Felker's number-two at the ''Herald Tribune.'' ''New York'''s first issue was dated April 8, 1968. Among the by-lines were many familiar names from the magazine's earlier incarnation, including Breslin, Wolfe (who wrote ''Tell if You're a Honk or a Wonk'' in the inaugural issue<ref>{{cite web|last=French|first=Alex|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref>), and [[George Goodman]], a financial writer who wrote as "[[Adam Smith]]."

Within a year, Felker had assembled a team of contributors who would come to define the magazine's voice. Breslin became a regular, as did [[Gloria Steinem]], who wrote the city-politics column, and [[Gail Sheehy]]. (Sheehy would eventually marry Felker, in 1984.) [[Harold Clurman]] was hired as the theater critic. [[Judith Crist]] wrote movie reviews. [[Alan Rich]] covered the classical-music scene.  [[Barbara Goldsmith]] was a Founding Editor of ''New York'' magazine and the author of the widely imitated series, “The Creative Environment,” in which she interviewed such subjects as [[Marcel Breuer]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[George Balanchine]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] about their creative process. [[Gael Greene]], writing under the rubric "The Insatiable Critic," reviewed [[restaurant]]s, cultivating a [[baroque]] writing style that leaned heavily on sexual [[metaphor]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  [[Woody Allen]] contributed a few stories for the magazine in its early years. The magazine's regional focus and innovative illustrations inspired numerous imitators across the country.<ref name="la times"/>

===1970s===
Wolfe, a regular contributor, to the magazine, wrote a story in 1970 that for many{{specify|date=March 2011}} defined the magazine (if not the age): "[[Radical Chic]]: That Party at Lenny's". The article described a benefit party for the [[Black Panthers]], held in [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s apartment, in a collision of [[high culture]] and low that paralleled ''New York'' magazine's ethos. In 1972, ''New York'' also launched ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'' magazine, which began as a special issue.<ref name="la times"/> ''[[New West (magazine)|New West]],'' a sister magazine on ''New York'''s model that covered [[California]] life, was also published for a few years in the 1970s.

Well into the 1970s, Felker continued to broaden the magazine's palette,{{vague|date=October 2010}} covering [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[Watergate]] scandal closely. In 1976, [[journalist]] [[Nik Cohn]] contributed a story called "[[Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night]]," about a young man in a [[working-class]] [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood who, once a week, went to a local [[discotheque|disco]] called Odyssey 2001; the story was a sensation and served as the basis for the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. Twenty years later, Cohn admitted (in a story in ''New York'') that he'd done no more than drive by Odyssey's door, and that he'd made the rest up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} It was a recurring problem of what Wolfe, in 1972, had labeled "The [[New Journalism]]."

In 1976, the Australian media baron [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought the magazine in a [[hostile takeover]], forcing Felker and Glaser out.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} A succession of editors followed, including Joe Armstrong and [[John Berendt]].

===1980s===
In 1980, Murdoch hired Edward Kosner, who had worked at ''[[Newsweek]]''. Murdoch also bought ''Cue'', a [[listings magazine]] that had covered the city since 1932, and folded it into ''New York'', simultaneously creating a useful going-out guide and eliminating a competitor.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cue Magazine Paved Way for Arts Guides |first1=PETER | last1= GLANKOFF |date= April 15, 1995 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/15/opinion/l-cue-magazine-paved-way-for-arts-guides-789495.html }}</ref>  Kosner's magazine tended toward a mix of newsmagazine-style stories, trend pieces, and pure "service" features—long articles on shopping and other consumer subjects—as well as close coverage of the glitzy 1980s New York City scene epitomized by financiers [[Donald Trump]] and [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]]. The magazine was [[Profit (economics)|profitable]] for most of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The term "the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]]" was coined for a 1985 story in the magazine.<ref>Blum, David, "Hollywood's Brat Pack", June 10, 1985, pp. 40–47.</ref>

===1990s===
Murdoch got out of the magazine business in 1991, selling his holdings to [[K-III Communications]], a partnership controlled by financier [[Henry Kravis]]. In January 1992, ''New York'' ran the first big magazine story on presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]], ten months before his election in November.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In 1993, budget pressure from K-III frustrated Kosner, and he left for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. After several months' search, during which the magazine was run by managing editor Peter Herbst, K-III hired [[Kurt Andersen]], the co-creator of ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'', a humor monthly of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Andersen quickly replaced several staff members, bringing in many emerging and established writers (including [[Jim Cramer]], [[Walter Kirn]], [[Michael Tomasky]], and [[Jacob Weisberg]]) and editors (including  Michael Hirschorn, Kim France, Dany Levy, and Maer Roshan), and generally making the magazine faster-paced, younger in outlook, and more knowing in tone.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In August 1996, [[Bill Reilly]] fired Andersen from his editorship, citing the publication's financial results.<ref>{{cite news| last=Weber | first=Bruce | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/business/media/21reilly.html | title=Bill Reilly, Magazine Publishing Executive, Dies at 70 | work=The New York Times | date=October 20, 2008 | accessdate=October 23, 2008}}</ref> According to Andersen, he was fired for refusing to kill a story about a rivalry between investment bankers [[Felix Rohatyn]] and [[Steven Rattner]] that had upset [[Henry Kravis]], a member of the firm's ownership group.<ref>{{cite news| last=Pogrebin | first=Robin | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5D8123CF93AA1575AC0A960958260 | title=When a Magazine Is Too Brash for the Bottom Line | work=The New York Times | date=September 29, 1996 | accessdate= October 23, 2008}}</ref> His replacement was Caroline Miller, who came from ''Seventeen'', another K-III title.

===2000s===
In 2002 and 2003, [[Michael Wolff]], the media critic hired by Miller in 1998, won two [[National Magazine Awards]] for his column.  At the end of 2003, ''New York'' was sold again, to financier [[Bruce Wasserstein]], for $55 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why Did He Buy New York? Hey, Wasserstein Loves Deals |first1=David | last1= Carr | first2=Andrew Ross | last2=Sorkin |date= December 18, 2003 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/18/business/why-did-he-buy-new-york-hey-wasserstein-loves-deals.html }}</ref>

Wasserstein replaced Miller with [[Adam Moss]], known for editing the short-lived New York weekly of the late 1980s "7 Days" and the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Energy and Acclaim, but No Profit Yet at New York Magazine |first=Katharine Q. | last=Seelye |date= April 4, 2005 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/04/business/media/04mag.html}}</ref>

In late 2004 the magazine was relaunched, most notably with two new sections: "The Strategist," devoted mostly to utility, and "The Culture Pages," covering the city's arts scene. Moss also rehired Kurt Andersen as a columnist.  In early 2006, the company began an aggressive digital expansion with the relaunch of the magazine's website, previously nymetro.com, as nymag.com.

Since 2004, the magazine has won twenty four National Magazine Awards, more than any other magazine over this time period,<ref>Flamm, Matthew. (2012-09-24) [http://adage.com/article/media/york-magazine-cashing-online/237385/ New York Magazine Cashing in Online | Media - Advertising Age]. Adage.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.</ref> including Magazine of the Year in 2013, General Excellence in Print four times, and General Excellence Online three times. During this same period it has been a finalist an additional 48 times in categories that included Profile Writing, Reviews and Criticism, Commentary, Public Service, Magazine Section, Leisure Interests, Personal Service, Single-Topic Issue, Photography, Photojournalism, Photo Portfolio, and Design. In 2007, when the magazine for the first time dominated the awards, much of the coverage the next day noted that ''[[The New Yorker]]'' took home no awards that night, despite receiving nine nominations, and also noted that ''New York'' was the first magazine to win for both its print and [[Internet]] editions in the same year.

The February 25, 2008 issue featured a series of nude photographs of [[Lindsay Lohan]]. Shot by [[Bert Stern]], the series replicated several poses from Stern's widely reproduced final photos of [[Marilyn Monroe]], shot shortly before the actress's fatal drug overdose. That week, the magazine's website received over 60 million hits and with traffic 2000 percent higher than usual.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The magazine is especially known for its food writing (its restaurant critic Adam Platt won a [[James Beard Award]] in 2009, and its Underground Gourmet critics Rob Patronite and Robin Raisfeld have won two National Magazine Awards); and also for its political coverage, especially [[John Heilemann]]'s reporting on the 2008 presidential election, which led to his (and [[Mark Halperin]]'s) best-selling book ''[[Game Change]]'', and for coverage of the first two years of the Obama administration; ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised its "hugely impressive political coverage" during this period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/76229/understanding-mccain |title=Understanding McCain &#124; The New Republic |publisher=Tnr.com |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

The magazine's current stable of writers includes national political columnist and correspondent [[John Heilemann]], Steve Fishman, Jesse Green, [[Vanessa Grigoriadis]], Joe Hagan, [[Mark Jacobson]], Jennifer Senior, Gabriel Sherman, Christopher Smith, and Jonathan Van Meter. Its culture critics include [[David Edelstein]] (movies), Matt Zoller Seitz(TV), [[Jerry Saltz]] (art), [[Justin Davidson]] (classical music and architecture), and Kathryn Schulz(books), who won the [[National Book Critics Circle]]'s Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing in 2012.

''New York'' has been widely recognized for its design during this period, with back-to-back design wins at the National Magazine Awards and Magazine of the Year wins from the Society of Publication Designers (SPD) in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 [[Eliot Spitzer]] “Brain” cover was named Cover of the Year by the [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] (ASME) and [[Advertising Age]] and 2009's “[[Bernie Madoff]], Monster” was named Best News & Business Cover by ASME. ''New York'' won back-to-back ASME Cover of the Year awards in 2012 and 2013, for "Is She Just Too Old for This?" and "The City and the Storm" respectively.  Design director Chris Dixon and photography director Jody Quon were named “Design Team of the Year” by [[Adweek]] in 2008.

In 2009, after [[Bruce Wasserstein]]'s death, the magazine's ownership passed to his family. Many obituaries noted Wasserstein's revival of the magazine. "While previous owners had required constant features in the magazine about the best place to get a croissant or a beret," wrote [[David Carr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', "it was clear that Wasserstein wanted a publication that was the best place to learn about the complicated apparatus that is modern New York. In enabling as much, Mr. Wasserstein recaptured the original intent of the magazine's founder, [[Clay Felker]]."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/wassersteins-new-york-magazine-a-deal-where-everyone-made-out/ | work=The New York Times | title=Wasserstein's New York Magazine: A Deal Where Everyone Made Out | first=David | last=Carr | date=October 15, 2009}}</ref>

===2010s===
On March 1, 2011. it was announced that [[Frank Rich]] would leave ''[[The New York Times]]'' to become an essayist and editor-at-large for ''New York''. Rich began his relationship with the magazine starting in June 2011.<ref name="NYMag">{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/03/frank_rich_joins_new_york.html |title=Frank Rich Joins New York Magazine |work=New York Magazine |accessdate=March 1, 2011 |date=March 1, 2011}}</ref>

''New York''{{'}}s "Encyclopedia of 9/11", published on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, was widely praised, with Gizmodo calling it "heartbreaking, locked in the past, and entirely current"; the issue won a National Magazine Award for Single-Topic Issue.<ref>[http://gizmodo.com/5837654/new-york-magazines-911-encyclopedia-is-perfect; http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/asmes-big-night-5891884]</ref>

''New York''{{'}}s offices in lower Manhattan were without electricity in the week following Hurricane Sandy, so the editorial staff published an issue from the midtown office of Wasserstein & Company, the firm that owns New York Media.<ref>[http://nymag.com/nymag/letters/hurricane-sandy-editors-letter-2012-11/]</ref> The issue's cover, shot by photographer Iwan Baan from a helicopter and showing Manhattan half in darkness, almost immediately became an iconic image of the storm,<ref>[http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/194225/architecture-photographer-explains-how-he-got-that-new-york-magazine-cover-shot/]</ref> and was named the magazine cover of the year by Time.<ref>[http://lightbox.time.com/2012/12/18/time-picks-the-top-photographic-magazine-covers-of-2012/#1]</ref> The photograph on the cover was published as a poster by the Museum of Modern Art, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Sandy relief efforts.<ref>[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/849595/iconic-hurricane-sandy-photo-to-moma-jeff-koons-designs-wine]</ref>

In 2013, ''New York'' magazine took the top honor at the National Magazine Awards again receiving magazine of the year for its print and digital coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/business/new-york-receives-national-magazine-awards-top-prize.html?ref=media&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Christine | last=Haughney | title=New York Receives National Magazine Awards' Top Prize | date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>

In December 2013, the magazine announced plans to move to a biweekly format in March 2014, reducing from 42 annual issues to 29.<ref>http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/12/new-york-magazine-will-publish-biweekly-in-2014.html</ref>

==Puzzles and competitions==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
''New York'' magazine was once known for its competitions and unique [[crossword puzzles]].  For the first year of the magazine's existence, the composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] contributed an extremely complex [[cryptic crossword]] to every third issue. In the style of British crosswords (as they are sometimes called), the cryptic crosswords feature clues that include a straight definition and a wordplay definition. [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]] took over thereafter. Since 1980, the magazine has also run an American-style crossword. For the first 30 years the puzzle was always by Maura B. Jacobson, but beginning in the summer of 2010, Cathy Allis Millhauser's byline began appearing in alternate weeks, and the magazine announced her as permanent co-constructor in September 2010. The cryptic crosswords were eventually dropped.

In the remaining two weeks out of every three, Sondheim's friend Mary Ann Madden edited<ref>''Cat People'', Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 52)</ref> an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: "Requiescat in Apache.") Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included [[David Mamet]], [[Herb Sargent]], and [[Dan Greenburg]]. [[David Halberstam]] once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Sondheim, [[Woody Allen]], and [[Nora Ephron]] were fans.

The Competition's demise, when Madden retired, was greatly lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the magazine published a letter from an Irish contestant, [[John O'Byrne]], who wrote: "How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one-letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!)." Many entrants have since migrated to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s similar "[[The Style Invitational|Style Invitational]]" feature.  Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled ''Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise'', ''Son of Giant Sea Tortoise'', and ''Maybe He's Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions''.

==Digital expansion and blogs==
In 2006, ''New York''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s website, nymag.com, underwent a year-long relaunch, transforming the site from a magazine companion to an up-to-the-minute news and service destination. In 2008 parent company New York Media purchased the online restaurant and menu resource MenuPages, which serves eight markets across the U.S., as a complement to its own online restaurant listings and to gain a foothold in seven additional cities.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/business/media/12menu.html | work=The New York Times | title=New York Magazine Buys MenuPages Site | first=Richard | last=Pérez-Peña | date=July 12, 2008}}</ref> In 2011 MenuPages was sold to Seamless.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/seamless-acquires-menupages-in-race-for-restaurants/ | title=Seamless Acquires Menupages in Race for Restaurants | work=The New York Times | first=Joshua | last=Brustein | date=September 26, 2011}}</ref> As of July 2010, digital revenue accounted for fully one third of company advertising revenue.<ref name="adage09">[http://adage.com/magazinealist2009/article?article_id=139723 New York's NYmag.com Is Ad Age's Magazine A-List Website of the Year], an October 2009 ''[[Ad Age]]'' article</ref>
