'''Leonard Alfred Schneider''' (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name '''Lenny Bruce''', was an American stand-up [[comedian]], [[social critic]] and [[satire|satirist]].
He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an [[obscenity]] trial was followed by a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] pardon, the first in New York State history, by then-Governor [[George Pataki]] in 2003. He paved the way for future outspoken [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture-era]] comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for freedom of speech in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/ |title=Lenny Bruce |work=nndb.com |year=2012 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/nyregion/no-joke-37-years-after-death-lenny-bruce-receives-pardon.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=No Joke! 37 Years After Death Lenny Bruce Receives Pardon - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2003-12-24 |accessdate=2013-12-05 |first1=John |last1=Kifner}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html |title=Lenny Bruce, Uninhibited Comic, Found Dead in Hollywood Home |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1966-08-04 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/arts/24carlin.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Mel | last1=Watkins | first2=Bruce | last2=Weber | title=George Carlin, Comic Who Chafed at Society and Its Constraints, Dies at 71 | date=2008-06-24}}</ref>

==Early life==
Lenny Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider in [[Mineola, New York]], grew up in nearby [[Bellmore, New York|Bellmore]], and attended [[Wellington C. Mepham High School]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=MCd3T4jdLMqi0QXA4cS1DQ&id=Ly8IAQAAMAAJ&dq=lenny+bruce+Wellington+C.+Mepham+High+School&q=Wellington+C.+Mepham+#search_anchor |title=Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!!  |page=107 |author=Albert Goldman, Lawrence Schiller|publisher=Penguin Books  |year= 1991 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> His parents divorced when he was five years old (the documentary ''[[Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth]]'' claims he was eight years old), and Lenny lived with various relatives over the next decade. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk and Lenny saw him very infrequently. The [[1940 census]] shows Myron (34) and Dorothy (36) Schneider and son, Leonard (14), living on Long Island at 710 Hughes Street, Bellmore, New York. Mickey later moved to [[Arcadia, California]] and became a [[podiatrist]]. Bruce's mother, [[Sally Marr]] (real name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg), was a stage performer and had an enormous influence on Bruce's career.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=hiZ3T7WOJ-rE0QX2hKj0Bw&id=i3ZcAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lenny+Bruce%3A+the+making+of+a+prophet&q=Sally+Marr#search_anchor |title=Lenny Bruce: the making of a prophet|page=47 |first=William Karl |last= Thomas |publisher=Archon Books |date= 1 Dec 1989 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>

After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the [[United States Navy]] at the age of 16 in 1942, and saw active duty during [[World War II]] aboard the {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40}} fighting in Northern Africa, [[Palermo]], [[Italy]] in 1943 and [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy in 1944. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his ship-mates in which he was dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], his commanding officers became upset. He defiantly convinced his ship's medical officer that he was experiencing homosexual urges.<ref>A.H. Goldman. ''Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!!'' (New York: Random House, 1971), p. 91</ref>  This led to his [[dishonorable discharge|Dishonorable Discharge]] in July 1945.  However, he had not admitted to or been found guilty of any breach of naval regulations and successfully applied to have his discharge changed to [[honorable discharge|"Under Honorable Conditions ... by reason of unsuitability for the naval service"]].<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/lenny-bruce-navy-records?page=10 "Lenny Bruce's Gay Naval Ruse: Unearthed documents detail comedian's discharge"], [[TheSmokingGun.com]], August 31, 2010</ref>

After a short stint in [[California]] spent living with his father, Bruce settled in [[New York City]], hoping to establish himself as a comedian. However, he found it difficult to differentiate himself from the thousands of other show business hopefuls who populated the city. One locale where they congregated was Hanson's, the diner where Bruce first met the comedian Joe Ancis,<ref name="Joe Acis: A Brief Biography"/> who had a profound influence on his approach to comedy. Many of Bruce's later routines reflected his meticulous schooling at the hands of Ancis.<ref>Goldman, p. 109</ref> According to Bruce's biographer, Albert Goldman, Ancis' humor involved stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasies, references to jazz, and stories of Jewish domesticity.<ref>Goldman, p. 105-108</ref>

Lenny took the stage as "Lenny Marsalle" one evening at the Victory Club, as a stand-in master of ceremonies for one of his mother's shows. His ad-libs earned him some laughs. Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and a free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|website=Reference.com|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> He was later a guest — and was introduced by his mother, who called herself "Sally Bruce" — on the [[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]] radio program, doing a Sid Caesar-inspired bit "The [[Bavaria]]n Mimic"  featuring impressions of American movie stars (e.g., [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], and [[Edward G. Robinson]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ben|title=The Comedy Behind the Tragedy|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-comedy-behind-the-tragedy/Content?oid=917393|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Bruce's early comedy career included writing the screenplays for ''[[Dance Hall Racket]]'' in 1953, which featured Bruce, his wife, [[Honey Harlow]], and mother, Sally Marr, in roles; ''[[Dream Follies]]'' in 1954, a low-budget [[American burlesque|burlesque]] romp; and a children's film, ''[[The Rocket Man (1954 film)|The Rocket Man]]'', in 1954. He also released four albums of original material on Berkeley-based [[Fantasy Records]], with rants, comic routines, and satirical interviews on the themes that made him famous: [[jazz]], [[moral philosophy]], [[politics]], [[patriotism]], [[religion]], [[law]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[abortion]], [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and [[Jewishness]]. These albums were later compiled and re-released as ''The Lenny Bruce Originals.'' Two later records were produced and sold by Bruce himself, including a 10-inch album of the 1961 San Francisco performances that started his legal troubles. Starting in the late 1950s, other unissued Bruce material was released by [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Phil Spector]], as well as Fantasy. Bruce developed the complexity and tone of his material in [[Enrico Banducci]]'s [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] nightclub, "The [[hungry i]]," where [[Mort Sahl]] had earlier made a name for himself.

Branded a "sick comic" - though it was the perceived "sickness" of modern society that he was railing about - Lenny was essentially blacklisted from television, and, when he did appear thanks to sympathetic fans like [[Steve Allen]] or [[Hugh Hefner]], it was with great concessions to [[Broadcast Standards and Practices (US)|Broadcast Standards and Practices]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Museum of Television & Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> Jokes that might offend, like a bit on airplane glue-sniffing teens done live for ''"The Steve Allen Show"'' in 1959, had to be typed out and pre-approved by network officials.

His growing fame led to appearances on the nationally televised ''[[The Steve Allen Show|Steve Allen Show]],'' where he made his debut with an unscripted comment on the recent marriage of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] to [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], wondering, "will Elizabeth Taylor become [[bat mitzvah]]?"<ref>{{YouTube|id=oCplnUga0hU?t=1m45s|title=Lenny Bruce}}</ref>  <!--San Francisco columnist [[Herb Caen]], however, was an early and enthusiastic supporter, writing in 1959:
<blockquote>They call Lenny Bruce a [[sick comic]], and sick he is. Sick of all the pretentious phoniness of a generation that makes his vicious humor meaningful. He is a rebel, but not without a cause, for there are shirts that need un-stuffing, egos that need deflating. Sometimes you feel guilty laughing at some of Lenny's mordant jabs, but that disappears a second later when your inner voice tells you with pleased surprise, 'but that's true.'</blockquote>
-->
On February 3, 1961, in the midst of a severe blizzard, he gave a famous performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. It was recorded and later released as a three-disc set, titled ''The Carnegie Hall Concert.'' In the liner notes, [[Albert Goldman]] described it as follows:

{{blockquote|This was the moment that an obscure yet rapidly rising young comedian named Lenny Bruce chose to give one of the greatest performances of his career. ... The performance contained in this album is that of a child of the jazz age. Lenny worshipped the gods of Spontaneity, Candor and [[Free association (psychology)|Free Association]]. He fancied himself an oral jazzman. His ideal was to walk out there like [[Charlie Parker]], take that mike in his hand like a horn and blow, blow, blow everything that came into his head just as it came into his head with nothing censored, nothing translated, nothing mediated, until he was pure mind, pure head sending out brainwaves like radio waves into the heads of every man and woman seated in that vast hall. Sending, sending, sending, he would finally reach a point of [[clairvoyance]] where he was no longer a performer but rather a medium transmitting messages that just came to him from out there — from recall, fantasy, prophecy.

A point at which, like the practitioners of [[automatic writing]], his tongue would outrun his mind and he would be saying things he didn't plan to say, things that surprised, delighted him, cracked him up — as if he were a spectator at his own performance!}}

==Personal life==
Bruce met his future wife, [[Honey Harlow]], a [[stripper]] from [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1951. They were married that same year, and Bruce was determined to have her end her work as a stripper.<ref>Kottler, Jeffrey A., ''Divine Madness: Ten Stories of Creative Struggle'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2006), 221</ref>

In 1953, Bruce and Harlow eventually left New York for the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where they got work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles, California. Bruce then went on to join the bill at the club Strip City. Harlow found employment at the Colony Club, which was widely known to be the best [[American burlesque|burlesque]] club in Los Angeles at the time.<ref>Goldman, p. 124</ref>

In late 1954, Bruce left Strip City and found work within the [[San Fernando Valley]] at a variety of strip clubs. As the master of ceremonies, his job was to introduce the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material. The clubs of the Valley provided the perfect environment for Bruce to create new routines: according to Bruce's primary biographer, [[Albert Goldman]], it was "precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low" that he suddenly broke free of "all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school."<ref>Goldman, p. 133</ref>

Honey and Lenny's daughter Kitty Bruce was born in 1955.<ref name="Ofiicial Lenny Bruce site">{{cite web|title=Chronology – The 50s|url=http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|work=The Official Lenny Bruce Site|publisher=Mystic Liquid|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>  He had an affair with the jazz singer [[Annie Ross]] in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/movies/pop-music-a-free-spirited-survivor-lands-on-her-feet.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Free-Spirited Survivor Lands on Her Feet|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 October 1993|first=James|last=Gavin|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> In 1959, Lenny's divorce from Honey was finalized.<ref name=NNDB>{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/|work=NNDB|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>

==Legal troubles==
[[File:Lenny Bruce arrest.jpg|thumb|Bruce arrested in 1961]]
This desire to end his wife's stripper days led Bruce to pursue schemes that were designed to make as much money as possible. The most notable was the Brother Mathias Foundation scam, which resulted in Bruce's arrest in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] later that year for impersonating a [[priest]]. He had been soliciting donations for a [[leprosy|leper]] colony in [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) under the auspices of the "Brother Mathias Foundation", which he had legally chartered – the name was his own invention, but possibly referred to the actual Brother Matthias who had befriended [[Babe Ruth]] at the Baltimore orphanage to which Ruth had been confined as a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chatterfromthedugout.com/babe_and_brother_matthias.htm |title=Babe Ruth and Brother Matthias |publisher=Chatterfromthedugout.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref> Bruce had stolen several priests' clergy shirts and a clerical collar while posing as a laundry man. He was found not guilty because of the legality of the New York state-chartered foundation, the actual existence of the Guiana [[leper colony]], and the inability of the local clergy to expose him as an impostor. Later, in his semifictional autobiography ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]'', Bruce revealed that he had made about $8,000 in three weeks, sending $2,500 to the leper colony and keeping the rest.

===Obscenity arrests===
On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961| title=Lenny Bruce – Chronology}}</ref> at the [[Jazz Workshop]] in [[San Francisco]]; he had used the word ''[[cocksucker]]'' and riffed that "''to'' is a [[preposition]], ''come'' is a [[verb]]", that the sexual context of ''[[orgasm|come]]'' is so common that it bears no weight, and that if someone hearing it becomes upset, he "probably can't come".<ref name=UMKC>{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Lenny|title=To is a Preposition, Come is a Verb|work=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>  Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under charges of obscenity.
[[File:Lenny Bruce Mugshot 4-27-63.jpg|thumb|left|Lenny Bruce in 1963, after being arrested in San Francisco]]
Bruce was arrested again in 1961, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], for [[drug possession]] and again in Los Angeles, California, two years later. The Los Angeles arrest took place in then-unincorporated [[West Hollywood]], and the arresting officer was a young deputy named [[Sherman Block]], who would later become County Sheriff. The specification this time was that the comedian had used the word ''[[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]]'', an insulting [[Yiddish]] term that is an obscene term for penis.<ref>Gross, David C. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ny1o6iXffDgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=yiddish+dictionary&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0FvsTqYYwuvRAcDu2N8J&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=shmuck&f=false English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary: Romanized]'' Hippocrene Books, 1995. p.144. ISBN 0-7818-0439-6</ref>

On December 5, 1962, Bruce was arrested at the legendary Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedians in Courthouses Getting Cuffed: Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, December 1962|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2014/03/25/comedians-in-courthouses-getting-cuffed-lenny-bruce-and-george-carlin-december-1962/|website=The Critic's Comic|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> The same year he played at [[Peter Cook]]'s [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]] Club in London, and a year later in April, he was barred from entering England by the Home Office as an "undesirable alien".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-60s/ |title=Chronology – The 60′s &#124; The Official Lenny Bruce Website |publisher=Lennybruceofficial.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>

In April 1964, he appeared twice at the [[Cafe Au Go Go]] in [[Greenwich Village]] with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with the club owners, Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance to take place. On both occasions, he was arrested after leaving the stage, the complaints again pertaining to his use of various obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linder|first1=Doug|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/bruceaccount.html|website=Famous Trials: The Lenny Bruce Trial 1964|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>

A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant D.A. [[Richard Kuh]], with [[Ephraim London]] and Martin Garbus as the defense attorneys. Bruce and club owner Howard Solomon were both found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from – among other artists, writers and educators – [[Woody Allen]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[William Styron]], and [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], and Manhattan journalist and television personality [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Herbert Gans]].<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/brucetrial.html Excerpts from the Lenny Bruce Trial (Cafe Au Go Go)]. Retrieved June 25, 2010.</ref> Bruce was sentenced, on December 21, 1964, to four months in a workhouse; he was set free on [[bail]] during the [[appeal]]s process and died before the appeal was decided. Solomon later saw his conviction overturned; Bruce, who died before the decision, never had his conviction stricken.<ref>''People v. Solomon'', 26 N.Y.2d. 621</ref> Bruce later received a full posthumous [[gubernatorial]] pardon.

==Later years==
[[File:Lenny Bruce at the Fillmore.jpg|thumb|Poster for Lenny Bruce's last series performances, which took place at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco on June 24 and 25, 1966.]]

Despite his prominence as a comedian, Bruce appeared on network television only six times in his life.<ref name=paley>{{cite web|title=The Museum of Television & Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> In his later club performances Bruce was known for relating the details of his encounters with the police directly in his comedy routine. These performances often included rants about his court battles over obscenity charges, tirades against [[fascism]] and complaints that he was being denied his right to [[freedom of speech]].

He was banned outright from several U.S. cities, and in 1962 an interview he was scheduled to give on Australian television was banned in advance by the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]].<ref>Goldman, p. 372</ref>

Increasing drug use also affected his health. By 1966 he had been [[blacklist]]ed by nearly every nightclub in the United States, as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. Bruce did give a famous performance at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]] in December 1965. It was recorded and became his last live album, titled "The Berkeley Concert"; his performance here has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at [[The Fillmore]] Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]].<ref name="graham">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wnZ0qL3QdkgC&pg=PA159&dq=Lenny+Bruce+fillmore+%22whacked+out+on+amphetamines&hl=en&sa=X&ei=68xrVLj3IImzyQTJuYHAAw&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22whacked%20out%20on%20amphetamines%22&f=false | title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out | publisher=Da Capo Press | date=2004 | accessdate=18 November 2014 | author=Graham, Bill; Greenfield, Robert | pages=156 | isbn=978-0306813498}}</ref> The performance was not remembered fondly by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], whose memoir describes Bruce as "whacked out on [[amphetamines|amphetamine]]";<ref>Graham, p. 159</ref> Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed.

At the request of [[Hugh Hefner]] and with the aid of [[Paul Krassner]], Bruce wrote an autobiography. Serialized in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1964 and 1965, this material was later published as the book ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]''.<ref name=watts>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Steven|title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470501375|page=190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&pg=PA190&dq=how+to+talk+dirty+and+influence+people+lenny+bruce+hefner+serialized+in+playboy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dx1tVMbEL82AygSdwIL4Cw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=how%20to%20talk%20dirty%20and%20influence%20people%20lenny%20bruce%20hefner%20serialized%20in%20playboy&f=false}}</ref> Hefner had long assisted Bruce's career, featuring him in the television debut of ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'' in October 1959.

During this time, Bruce also contributed a number of articles to [[Paul Krassner]]'s satirical magazine ''[[The Realist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Realist Archive Project|url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/index.html}} Issues 15, 41, 48, 54.</ref>

On August 3, 1966, a bearded Lenny Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his [[Hollywood Hills]] home at 8825 W. Hollywood Blvd.<ref name=Obituary>{{cite news|last=AP|title=Obituary|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html|accessdate=28 November 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 4, 1966}}</ref>  The official photo, taken at the scene, showed Bruce lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other [[narcotic]]s paraphernalia. According to legend, a policeman at the scene said, "There is nothing sadder than an aging hipster", which itself was possibly one of Bruce's lines.<ref name="Chicago Reader">{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Ben|title=The Comedy Behind the Tragedy|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-comedy-behind-the-tragedy/Content?oid=917393|accessdate=28 November 2011|newspaper=The Chicago Reader|date=December 2, 2004}}</ref>  Record producer [[Phil Spector]], a friend of Bruce's, bought the negatives of the photographs to keep them from the press. The official cause of death was "acute [[morphine]] poisoning caused by an accidental [[drug overdose|overdose]]."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American Icon|last1=Collins|first1=Ronald|last2=Skover |first2=David|year=2002|publisher=Sourcebooks Mediafusion|isbn=1-57071-986-1|page=340}}</ref>

His remains were interred in [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]], but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. The service saw over 500 people pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials had tried to block the ceremony after advertisements for the event encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. [[Dick Schaap]] eulogized Bruce in ''Playboy'', with the memorable last line: "One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. ''That's'' obscene."

His epitaph reads: "Beloved father – devoted son/Peace at last."

Bruce is survived by his daughter, Kitty Bruce (born Brandy Kathleen Bruce), who lives in [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Fox, Margalit.
