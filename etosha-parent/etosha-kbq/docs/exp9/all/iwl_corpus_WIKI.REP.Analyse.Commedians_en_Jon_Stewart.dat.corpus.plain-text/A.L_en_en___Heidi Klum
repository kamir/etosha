Klum became internationally known for her appearances on the cover of the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. In 1997, she became the first German model to become a [[Victoria's Secret Angel]].

She has worked as a [[spokesmodel]] for [[Dannon]] and [[H&M]], and has appeared in numerous commercials for [[McDonald's]], [[Volkswagen]] and others.

She was married to English [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] from 2005 until 2012.

In November 2008, Klum appeared in two versions of a ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' commercial, wherein she did a take on [[Tom Cruise]]'s iconic underwear dancing scene in ''[[Risky Business]]''. In both versions, she lip-synced to [[Bob Seger]]'s "[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]" while dancing around the living room with the wireless guitar controller.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1083315/VIDEO-Heidi-Klums-risqu-business-spoofs-Tom-Cruises-famous-air-guitar-scene.html "VIDEO: Heidi Klum's risqué business as she spoofs Tom Cruise's famous air guitar scene"].

''Forbes'' noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria's Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a [[businesswoman]] than a model.

=== Bomb threat during GNTM live finale ===

During the live finale of the 10th season of ''[[Germany's Next Top Model]]'' in the [[Mannheim]] [[SAP Arena]] on May 14, 2015, a telephone call by a woman came in at 9:07 pm, threatening that a bomb would go off during the live show. The organizer decided to have the hall evacuated and then to call the police. In the meantime, the live broadcast had been canceled and a note was shown to the television viewers, stating that the show had been interrupted due to technical issues.
Later on, a man was arrested after he came near Klum, issuing another bomb threat. Thereupon, she was taken to a secret place along with her daughter Leni and the two other judges.
A suspicious suitcase was found, which however turned out to be a false alarm.<ref>{{cite news|title= Finale in Mannheim: Bombendrohung - "Germany's Next Topmodel" abgebrochen|date=May 14, 2015|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/tv/gntm-germany-s-next-top-model-sendung-unterbrochen-a-1033803.html|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}</ref>
