==History==
{{Main|History of Fox News}}

===Early years===
In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Marvin Davis]] intended to develop "a network of [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] as a fourth marketing force" to compete directly with [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through the purchase of six television stations owned by [[Metromedia]].<ref>Lenzner, Robert (May 5, 1985).

''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. July 17, 1986.  Section: Business; p. 1. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

Prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when [[News Corporation]]'s [[BSkyB]] subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel ([[Sky News]]) in the United Kingdom in 1989.<ref>Shah, Saeed (September 24, 2002).

In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DE1F3FF934A35753C1A960958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/A/Ailes,%20Roger%20E.|title=At the new Fox News Channel, the buzzword is fairness, separating news from bias| work=The New York Times|first=Lawrie|last=Mifflin|date=October 7, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> [[Roger Ailes]] left cable television channel [[America's Talking]] (now [[MSNBC]]), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel.

At its debut 17 million households were able to watch FNC;<ref name=King>{{cite news|title=Fox Hunts TV News Niche with Channel Debut Today|work=[[New York Daily News]]|first=Angela G.|last=King|date=October 7, 1996}}</ref> however, it was absent from the media markets of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. According to published reports, many media reviewers had to watch the first day's programming at Fox News' studios because it was not readily available via cable.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider (news anchor)|Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report'' (now ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''), ''The Crier Report'' (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''.

From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and attention-getting; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and "bullet points" when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the "Fox News Alert," which interrupted its regular programming when a [[breaking news]] story occurred.

To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18396534/bold-grab-subs-murdoch.html|author=Richard Katz|date=May 1996|title=Bold grab for subs: Murdoch offers $11 to carry Fox News|publisher=Multichannel News| accessdate=September 1, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRU0fPQa|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When [[Time Warner]] bought [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]], a federal [[antitrust]] [[consent decree]] required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own [[CNN]] on its [[Time Warner Cable|cable systems]]. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed that this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E3DA123FF937A35753C1A960958260|title=Giuliani Pressures Time Warner to Transmit a Fox Channel| work=The New York Times|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=October 4, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E7DB103FF936A35753C1A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=City Hall Threatens Action if Time Warner Rejects Channel|work=The New York Times|first=Clifford J.|last=Levy|date=October 5, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>
[[File:Fox News-2.svg|thumb|A logo variation of the former Fox News Channel logo]]
A lawsuit was filed by Time Warner against the City of New York, claiming undue interference with (and inappropriate use of) the city's educational channels for commercial programming. News Corporation countered with an antitrust lawsuit against Time Warner for unfairly protecting CNN. This led to an acrimonious battle between Murdoch and Turner, with Turner publicly comparing Murdoch to [[Adolf Hitler]]; Murdoch's ''[[New York Post]]'' ran an editorial questioning Turner's sanity. Giuliani's motives were also questioned, since his wife was a producer at Murdoch-owned Fox station [[WNYW]]. In the end, Time Warner and News Corporation signed a [[settlement (law)|settlement]] agreement permitting Fox News to be carried on New York City cable systems beginning in October 1997, and on all Time Warner Cable systems by 2001 (although Time Warner still does not carry Fox News in all areas).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During the [[September 11th attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], Fox News was the first news organization to run a [[news ticker]] on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.<ref name="The Fox News Ticker">{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/2012/09/11/11-direct-effects-9-11-had-on-the-sports-and-entertainment-indus/#photo=2|title=11 Direct Effects 9/11 Had on the Sports and Entertainment Industries|last=Dudak|first=Gary|date=September 11, 2012|publisher=Mandatory.com|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Fox News Channel}}
FNC presents a variety of programming, with up to 15 hours of live broadcasting per day in addition to programming and content for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. Most programs are broadcast from Fox News headquarters in New York City (at [[1211 Avenue of the Americas]]), in its streetside studio on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] in the west wing of [[Rockefeller Center]], sharing its headquarters with sister channel [[Fox Business Network]]. Fox News Channel has seven studios at its New York City headquarters that are used for its and Fox Business' programming: Studio B (used for Fox Business programming), Studio D (which has an area for studio audiences; and is used by ''[[The Five (TV program)|The Five]]'' and ''[[Huckabee]]''), Studio E (used for ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', ''[[Your World with Neil Cavuto]]'', ''[[Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld]]'', and certain editions of ''[[America's News Headquarters|America's News HQ]]''), Studio G (which houses Fox Business shows and FNC's ''[[Justice with Judge Jeanine]]''), Studio H (used for ''[[Fox & Friends First]]'', ''[[Happening Now]]'', ''[[Studio B (TV series)|Studio B]]'' and the ''[[Fox Report]]''), Studio J (used for ''[[America's Newsroom]]'', ''[[America Live with Megyn Kelly]]'', ''[[Hannity]]'' and Fox Business' ''[[Money with Melissa Francis]]'') and the Web Studio (used for ''Fox News Live'' internet shows).

The remaining programs (such as ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', ''[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren]]'', and editions of ''America's News HQ'' not broadcast from the New York City studios) are broadcast from Fox News's [[Washington, D.C.]] studio, located on [[Capitol Hill]] across from [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in a secured building shared by a number of other television networks (including [[NBC News]] and [[C-SPAN]]). Audio simulcasts of the channel are aired on [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].

In an October 11, 2009 ''New York Times'' article, Fox articulated that its hard-news programming runs from "9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays" and "[is] objective"; however, it makes no such claims for its other broadcasts, which primarily consist of editorial journalism and commentary.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html Stelter, Brian.

==Ratings and reception==
[[File:Fox News Channel's Hannity and Colmes production area.jpg|thumb|left|FNC's ''[[Hannity]]'' production area|alt=Newsroom, with political signs on the wall]]
FNC saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq conflict]]. According to some reports, at the height of the conflict Fox News had as much as a 300-percent increase in viewership (averaging 3.3 million viewers daily).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3148015.stm|title=War coverage lifts News Corp|publisher=[[The British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=November 29, 2005|date=August 13, 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUCY6gc|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> In 2004, FNC's ratings for its broadcast of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] exceeded those of the three major broadcast networks. During President [[George W. Bush]]'s address, Fox News attracted 7.3 million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million and 5.0 million respectively.

In late 2005 and early 2006, FNC saw a brief decline in ratings. One decline was in the second quarter of 2006, when Fox News lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier|Special Report with Brit Hume]]'', for example, dropped 19 percent. Several weeks later, in the wake of the [[North Korean missile test, 2006|North Korean missile crisis]] and the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the #1-rated cable news channel.<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/fncs_2554_prime_downward_spiral_20939.asp FNC's 25–54 Prime "Downward Spiral"], TV Newser</ref><ref>[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2005/narrative_cabletv_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&media=5 Cable TV: Content Analysis]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, The State of the News Media 2005</ref> Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' finishing first and second respectively.<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/ranker_april05.pdf April 2005 Competitive Program Ranker (M-F 6a-11p programs)], TV Newser</ref>

In September 2009, the [[Pew Research Center]] published a report on the public view of national news organizations. In the report, 72 percent of polled Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as "favorable", while 43 percent of polled Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all polled viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox was given the highest "unfavorable" rating of all national outlets studied (25 percent of all polled viewers). The report went on to say, "partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007".<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Accuracy Rating Hits Two-Decade Low|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1341/press-accuracy-rating-hits-two-decade-low|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUF5PM6|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

On the night of October 22, 2012, Fox set a record for its highest-rated [[Broadcasting|telecast]] ever, with 11.5 million viewers for the third [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|U.S. presidential debate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/final-obama-romney-debate-gives-381956|title=Final Debate Breaks Fox News Ratings Record With 11.5 Million, Topping Cable Competition|author=Michael O'Connell|date=October 23, 2012|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Patten|first=Dominic|title=UPDATE: 59.2M Watch Final Presidential Debate; NBC Wins Coverage Battle|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/10/fox-news-breaks-ratings-record-with-third-presidential-debate/#utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter|publisher=Deadline}}</ref> In prime time the week before, Fox averaged almost 3.7 million viewers with a total day average of 1.66 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=Fox News scores big ratings win|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-fox-news-ratings-20121023,0,240248.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 23, 2012}}</ref>

A Public Policy Polling poll concluded in 2013 that perceptions of FNC had declined from 2010. 41% of polled voters said they trust it, down from 49% in 2010, while 46% said they distrust it, up from 37% in 2010. It was also called the "most trusted" network by 34% of those polled, more than had said the same of any other network.<ref>[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_National_206.pdf Fox News' Credibility Declines] Public Policy Polling February 6, 2013</ref>

In [[primetime]] and total day ratings for the week of April 15 to 21, 2013, Fox News, propelled by its coverage of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], was the highest-ranked network on U.S. [[cable television]], for the first time since August 2005, when [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/fox-news-tops-all-cable-for-1st-time-since-2005|title=Fox News Tops All Cable For 1st Time Since 2005|date=April 23, 2007|work=Deadline|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>

January 2014 marked Fox News's 145th consecutive month as the number one rated cable news channel. During that month, Fox News beat CNN and MSNBC combined in overall viewers in both [[prime time]] hours and the total day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/fnc-extends-cable-news-ratings-winning-streak-in-january/|title=Fox News Channel Tops Cable News Ratings In January - Deadline|date=January 28, 2014|work=Deadline|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref> In the third quarter of 2014, the network was the most-watched cable channel during prime time hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-news-nabs-historic-cable-736624|title=Fox News Nabs Historic Cable Ratings Victory|author=Michael O'Connell|date=September 30, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>

During the final week of the campaign for the [[United States elections, 2014]], Fox News had the highest ratings of any cable channel, news or otherwise. On election night itself, Fox News' coverage had higher ratings than that of any of the other five cable or network news sources among viewers between 25 and 54 years of age.<ref>{{cite news| last =Zurawik| first =David| title =New level of Fox News dominance demands analysis, not dismissal| newspaper =Baltimore Sun| publisher =Tribune Publishing| date =17 November 2014| url =http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bal-fox-news-ratings-dominance-demands-analysis-20141117-story.html| accessdate =23 November 2014 }}</ref>

==Demographics==
As indicated by a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, based on [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] statistics, Fox appears to have an aging demographic.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/business/its-viewers-are-graying-but-their-passion-pays-for-fox-news.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Carter | title=Fox Viewers May Be Graying, but Their Passion Still Pays | date=July 22, 2013}}</ref> In 2008, in the 25-54 age group, Fox News had an average of 557,000 viewers, but dropped to 379,000 in 2013 while increasing its overall audience from 1.89 million in 2010 to 2.02 million in 2013. The [[median age]] for Fox News viewers is listed as 65+ as Nielsen does not give exact figures for ages over 65.

==Slogan==
[[File:Fairbalanced.png|thumb|2005 "Fair & Balanced" graphic|alt="Fair & Balanced" against blue, black and red background]]
"Fair & Balanced" is a [[trademark]]ed slogan used by the broadcaster, originally used in conjunction with the phrase "Real Journalism". Comedian [[Al Franken]] used the slogan in the subtitle for his 2003 book ''[[Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them|Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right]]''. In the book, he cites examples of what he claims to be Fox News' [[Media bias|bias]]. On August 7, 2003, Fox News sued for trademark infringement.<ref name="foxsuit">de Moraes, Lisa (August 12, 2003). [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A46985-2003Aug11?language=printer Three Little Words: Fox News Sues.] ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref> The lawsuit was dropped three days later, after Judge [[Denny Chin]] refused its request for an [[injunction]]. In his decision, Chin ruled that the case (''[[Fox v. Franken]]'') was "wholly without merit, both factually and legally". He went on to suggest that Fox News' trademark on the phrase "fair and balanced" could be invalid.<ref name="foxloss">Phil Hirschkorn (August 22, 2003). [http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/08/22/fox.franken/ Fox News loses attempt to block satirist's book]. ''CNN''</ref>

In December 2003, FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when [[AlterNet]] filed a cancellation petition with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to have FNC's trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included the documentary film ''[[Outfoxed]]'' as supporting evidence in its case.<ref name="coyle">Coyle, Jake (July 19, 2004). Advocacy Groups Challenge Fox News Slogan. Associated Press</ref> After losing early motions, AlterNet withdrew its petition; the USPTO dismissed the case.<ref>[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92042790&pty=CAN&eno=1 Official Documentation of Petitioned Cancellation of "Fair & Balanced" trademark phrase], Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System</ref> In 2008, FNC used the slogan "We Report, You Decide", referring to "You Decide 2008" (FNC's original slogan for its coverage of election issues).

FOXNews.com has used the slogan "[[Where's the beef?]]" as a catchphrase in twelve headlines for various topics since 2001.<ref>[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/money/2015/03/04/amid-shortgaes-venezuela-permits-uruguay-to-pay-for-oil-with-beef/ "Where's the beef?

A leaked memo from Fox News vice president [[Bill Sammon]] to news staff at the height of the [[health care reform in the United States]] debate has been cited as an example of the pro-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] bias of Fox News. His memo asked the staff to "use the term 'government-run health insurance,' or, when brevity is a concern, 'government option,' whenever possible". The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster [[Frank Luntz]] advised [[Sean Hannity]] on his Fox show that "If you call it a public option, the American people are split. If you call it the government option, the public is overwhelmingly against it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-fox-news-memo-reveals-news-division-told-to-echo-gop-talking-point-2010-12|title=Leaked Fox News Memo Reveals News Division Told To Echo GOP Talking Point, ''Business Insider'', December 9, 2010|date=December 9, 2010|work=Business Insider|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>

A Pew Research poll released on October 29, 2009 found that Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America. 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is "mostly conservative", 14 percent said "mostly liberal" and 24 percent said "neither". In comparison, [[MSNBC]] had 36 percent identify it as "mostly liberal", 11 percent as "mostly conservative" and 27 percent as "neither". [[CNN]] had 37 percent describe it as "mostly liberal", 11 percent as "mostly conservative" and 33 percent as "neither".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/559/|title=Fox News Viewed as Most Ideological Network|publisher=People-press.org|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUIme70|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> A 2004 [[Pew Research Center]] survey showed that FNC was cited (unprompted) by 69 percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization.

The poll also reported that 36 percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias, compared with 37 percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of CNN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/media/americans_see_liberal_media_bias_on_tv_news|title=Americans See Liberal Media Bias on TV News – Rasmussen Reports|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|date=July 13, 2007 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> A 2007 study looked at the introduction of Fox News into local U.S. markets between 1996 and 2000, and found that in the 2000 presidential election "Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News".

A 2010 study by Sean Aday comparing Fox News Channel's ''Special Report With Brit Hume'' and NBC's ''[[NBC Nightly News|Nightly News]]'' coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during 2005 found that both underplayed bad news; it concluded that "Fox News was much more sympathetic to the administration than NBC", suggesting that "if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at FNC...they should consider Fox as alternative, rather than mainstream, media". Aday also stated, however, that the data used in his study may have come late enough in the war to be consistent with accepted practice.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}<ref>Aday, S.

[[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]], media critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]] results coverage on Fox News for the network's response to Republican adviser and Fox News contributor [[Karl Rove]] challenging its call that [[Barack Obama]] would win Ohio and the election. Fox's prediction was correct. Carr wrote:
{{quote |text= Over many months, Fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop: that President Obama was a clear failure, that a majority of Americans saw [[Mitt Romney|[Mitt] Romney]] as a good alternative in hard times, and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed.

===Obama administration conflict with Fox News===
In September 2009, the [[Obama administration]] engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about the president by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, and Fox coverage of Obama's health-care proposal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Fox's Volley With Obama Intensifying|first=Brian|last=Stelter|date=October 12, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref><ref name="usnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/obama/2009/10/23/fox-pushed-team-obama-over-the-brink.html |title=White House: Fox Pushed Team Obama Over the Brink – US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 29, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUSCZjg |archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In late September 2009, Obama senior advisor [[David Axelrod]] and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later, White House officials referred to FNC as "not a news network", communications director [[Anita Dunn]] stating that "Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/10/23/the-fox-news-war-whats-the-upside-for-obama/|title=The Fox News war: What's the upside for Obama?|publisher=CSMonitor.com|date=|accessdate=October 23, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUTCrgh|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> President Obama observed, "If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/23/eveningnews/main5415921.shtml?tag=stack|title=President Obama's Feud with FOX News – CBS Evening News|publisher=CBS News|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUTlhWd|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] stated that it was important "to not have the CNNs and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rutten24-2009oct24,0,3009088.column|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Obama's misguided Fox hunt|date=October 24, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUVTHlE|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

On November 8, 2009, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who "deal with TV issues" and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid Fox.

==International transmission==
The FNC feed is available internationally via a number of providers, while ''Fox Extra'' segments provide alternate programming.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,77537,00.html|title=Fox Around the World|work=Fox News.com|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref>

==={{anchor|Fox Extra}}''Fox Extra''===
Initially, U.S. advertisements were replaced on FNC with viewer e-mail and profiles of FNC anchors set to music. In 2002, these were replaced with international weather forecasts. In 2006, the weather forecasts were replaced with ''Fox Extra'' (originally ''Fox News Extra'', prior to the international launch of [[Fox Business]]) segments, narrated reports from Fox on a variety of topics. These reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events, and the segments are repeated. FNC also shows international weather forecasts when ''Fox Extra'' segments run short. In the United Kingdom, after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks, ''Fox Extra'' now fills most breaks.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], FNC is broadcast on the three major pay television providers: [[Foxtel]], it's regional subsidiary [[Austar]] and [[Optus Television]]. Foxtel is 50% owned by [[News Corp Australia]], the Australian arm of [[News Corp]] which is the sister company of [[21st Century Fox]] which owns FNC. Local Australian channel [[Sky News Australia]], which is one-third owned by [[Sky (United Kingdom)|British Sky Broadcasting]] whose parent company is also owned by 21st Century Fox, is therefore FNC's sister channel.<ref name=CMHacq>{{Cite news | title = News Limited seals pay TV deal after Federal Court approves CMH takeover | work = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = 4 November 2012 | date = 2 November 2012 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/news-limited-seals-pay-tv-deal-after-federal-court-approved-cmh-acqusition/story-e6frg6n6-1226509333236 }}</ref>

In 2004, after a Fox News U.S. executive said there were no plans to create a combined channel, the CRTC approved an application to bring Fox News to Canada.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/11/18/fox_crtc041118.html|title=CRTC approves Fox News for Canada |publisher=cbc.ca|date=November 18, 2004|accessdate=August 27, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUZpdxg|archivedate=November 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>
