"'''One man, one vote'''" (or "'''one person, one vote'''") is a slogan that has been used in many parts of the world where campaigns have arisen for [[universal suffrage]]. During the 20th-century period of decolonisation and the struggles for national sovereignty, from the late 1940s onwards this phrase became widely used in [[less developed countries]] where majority populations were seeking to gain political power in proportion to their numbers.

The phrase was used in this form in an important legal ruling in the [[United States]] related to voting rights; applying the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution, the Supreme Court majority opinion in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964) ruled that state legislatures needed to redistrict in order to have congressional districts with roughly equal represented populations. In addition, the court ruled that both houses of state legislatures needed to have representation based on districts containing roughly equal populations, with redistricting as needed after censuses.<ref name="governance">[http://www.charlestoncounty.org/MAP/FinalReport/pages219-238.pdf Charlie B. Tyler, "The South Carolina Governance Project"], University of South Carolina, 1998, p. 221</ref> Many urban areas of the United States had been long underrepresented in [[Congress]] and [[state legislatures]] due to the failure of the latter to redistrict according to population.

==United Kingdom==
This phrase was traditionally used in the context of demands for [[suffrage#History of suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffrage]] reform. Historically the emphasis within the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] was on representing ''areas'': [[county constituency|counties]], [[borough constituency|boroughs]] and, later on, [[university constituency|universities]]. The entitlement to vote for the [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] representing the constituencies varied widely, with different qualifications over time, such as owning property of a certain value, holding an apprenticeship, qualifying for paying the local-government rates, or holding a degree from the university in question. Those who qualified for the vote in more than one constituency were entitled to vote in each constituency, whilst many adults did not qualify for the vote at all. [[Plural voting]] was also present in local government, whereby the owners of business property qualified for votes in the relevant [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]].

Reformers argued that Members of Parliament and other elected officials should represent citizens equally, and that each voter should be entitled to exercise the vote once in an election. Successive [[Reform Act]]s by 1950 had both extended the franchise eventually to almost all adult citizens (barring [[convicts]], [[lunatics]] and members of the [[House of Lords]]), and also reduced and finally eliminated most of the plural voting for both Westminster and local-government elections.

But, there were two significant exceptions. The [[City of London]] had never expanded its boundaries and, with many residential dwellings being replaced by businesses, and the destruction of [[The Blitz]], after the [[World War II|Second World War]] the financial district had barely five thousand residents altogether. The system of plural voting was retained for electing the [[City of London Corporation#Elections|City of London Corporation]], with some modifications.

===Northern Ireland===
When [[Northern Ireland]] was established in 1921, it adopted the same political system then in place for the Westminster Parliament and British local government. But, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] did not follow Westminster in changes to the franchise up to 1950. As a result, into the 1960s, plural voting was still allowed for both Parliament and local government. Historians and political scholars have debated the extent to which the franchise for local government contributed to [[unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] electoral success in controlling councils in [[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]]-majority areas.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm| title = 'How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921-1968?' | accessdate = 2007-08-30| author = [[John H. Whyte]] | publisher = [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]}}</ref>

Based on a number of inequities, the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] was founded in 1967. It had five primary demands, and added the demand that each citizen in Northern Ireland be afforded the same number of votes for elections. The slogan "one man, one vote" became a rallying cry for this campaign.

===Historical background===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
The [[United States Constitution]] requires a [[United States Census|decennial census]] for the purpose of assuring a fair [[Apportionment (politics)|distribution of seats]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. The census has generally been conducted without incident, with the exception of the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929|1920 Census]]. <!--What has "occurred"? The census, or reapportionment?--> Congressional seats have been reapportioned based on population changes between states. State legislatures initially established election of congressional representatives from [[Constituency|districts]], often based on traditional counties or parishes which preceded founding of the new government. The question arose as to whether the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]]s were required to ensure that congressional districts were roughly equal in population and to draw new districts to accommodate demographic changes.

Some states redrew their U.S. House districts every ten years to reflect changes in population patterns; many did not. Some never redrew them, except when it was mandated by a change in the number of seats to which that state was entitled in the House of Representatives. In many states, this led to a skewing of influence for voters in some districts over those in others. For example, if the 2nd congressional district eventually had a population of 1.5 million, but the 3rd had only 500,000, then, in effect — since each district elected the same number of representatives — a voter in the 3rd district had three times the voting "power" of a 2nd-district voter. Alabama's state legislature resisted redistricting from 1910 to 1972 (when forced by federal court order.)  As a result, rural residents retained a wildly disproportionate amount of power in a time when other areas of the state became urbanized and industrialized, attracting greater populations. Such urban areas were underrepresented in the state legislature and underserved; their residents had difficulty getting needed funding for infrastructure and services. They paid far more in taxes to the state than they received in benefits in relation to the population.<ref name="governance"/>

The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] includes the result of the [[Great Compromise]] resulting in representation for the US Senate. Each state was equally represented in the Senate with two representatives, without regard to population. The [[Founding Fathers]] considered this principle of such importance that they included a clause in the Constitution to prohibit any state from being deprived of equal representation in the Senate without its permission; see [[Article V of the United States Constitution]]. For this reason, "one man one vote" has never been implemented in the U.S. Senate, in terms of representation by states.

When states established their legislatures, they often adopted a bicameral model based on colonial governments. Many copied the Senate principle, establishing an upper house based on geography - for instance a state senate with one representative drawn from each county. By the 20th century, this often led to state senators having widely varying amounts of power, with ones from rural areas having votes equal to senators representing much greater urban populations. The US Supreme Court held in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964) that states had no basis for a senate based on geography, and it ruled that both houses of state legislatures had to be based on the one man, one vote principle.

The ruling also required that state legislatures create population-based districts for election of representatives to the lower houses, and update them as needed according to census results. Similarly, up to that time, many states had state representatives drawn from geographic districts, such as counties. Even if the state legislature updated the number of seats apportioned to each county (and many made no changes for decades), it might not fully reconcile representation of equal populations based on the decennial census. Urban areas had received concentrations of residents, including immigrants, since the late 19th century. All these people and their descendants were often still underrepresented in the 1960s. Analysis found that in both the North and the South, East and West, urban areas were underrepresented in state legislatures because of the failure of those bodies to redistrict according to population. Therefore, ''Reynolds v. Sims'' had broad effects across the country in forcing state legislatures to bring representation up to date.

County-based representation had one benefit - it was immune from [[gerrymandering]] and the effects of population change. Thus it prevented efforts at [[planned shrinkage]]: that is, once a part of a state was populous enough to control the legislature under one man-one vote, it could implement policies to drive people out of areas controlled by the opposition and cement the power of the localized majority. Since the senate's representation was immovable regardless of population, the affected parties would theoretically have enough power in that chamber to stop any further damage.

[[Activism]] in the [[civil rights movement]] to regain the ability of African Americans in the South to register and vote highlighted other voting inequities across the country. Numerous court challenges were raised, including in Alabama due to the lack of reapportionment for decades.

=== Warren Court decisions ===
In various reapportionment cases decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in the 1960s, notably ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'', ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), and ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', the court ruled that districts for the United States House of Representatives, and for the legislative districts of both houses of state legislatures, had to contain roughly equal populations, and required redistricting to meet this standard. The U.S. Senate was not affected by these rulings, as its makeup was explicitly established in the U.S. Constitution.

The cases concerning malapportionment ended the pattern of area-based representation in the U.S. House and state legislatures; these corrected imbalances between rural and urban populations. Eventually the rulings were extended over local (city) districts as well, as in ''[[Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838157,00.html | work=Time | title=The Supreme Court: One-Man, One-Vote, Locally | date=1968-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>

In the final analysis, no voter is given greater weight in his or her vote over the vote of another voter, although to understand this does require a conceptual understanding of how the effect of a 'M.P.V. System' is like that of a run-off election. The form of majority preferential voting employed in the City of Ann Arbor's election of its Mayor does not violate the one-man, one-vote mandate nor does it deprive anyone of equal protection rights under the Michigan or United States Constitutions.</blockquote>
