'''Garry Emmanuel Shandling''' (born November 29, 1949), also known as '''Randall Shellington''', is an American comedian, actor, writer, producer, and director. He is best known for his work in ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' and ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.

Shandling began his career writing for sitcoms such as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' and ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''. He made a successful stand-up performance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and became a frequent guest-host on the show. Shandling was for a time considered the leading contender to replace Carson (other hopefuls were [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Letterman]] and [[David Brenner]]). In 1986 he created ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', for the pay cable channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. It was nominated for four [[Emmy Awards]] (including one for Shandling) and lasted until 1990. His second show, ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', which began airing on [[HBO]] in 1992, was even more successful. Shandling was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the show and won in 1998, along with [[Peter Tolan]], for writing the series finale.

During his three-decade career, Shandling has been nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards and two [[Golden Globe]] Awards, along with many other awards and nominations.

==Early life and career==
Shandling was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a [[Jew]]ish family. He grew up in [[Tucson, Arizona]], the son of Muriel, a pet store proprietor, and Irving Shandling, a print shop owner.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/Garry-Shandling.html Garry Shandling Biography (1949–)]</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/arts/television/28stei.html?pagewanted=3 | work=The New York Times | title=Hey Now: It's Garry Shandling's Obsession | first=Jacques | last=Steinberg | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> He had an older brother, Barry, who died of [[cystic fibrosis]] when Garry was 10. Shandling attended [[Palo Verde High School (Arizona)|Palo Verde High School]]. After graduation, he attended the [[University of Arizona]], at first majoring in [[electrical engineering]], but eventually completing a degree in marketing and pursuing a year of [[postgraduate studies]] in creative writing.

In 1973, Shandling moved to Los Angeles, California. He worked at an [[advertising agency]] for a time, and then sold a script for the popular [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Sanford and Son]]''. Shandling's script became the November 21, 1975 episode titled "Sanford and the Rising Son," in which Ah Chew (played by [[Pat Morita]]) turned junkyard owner Fred Sanford's (played by [[Redd Foxx]]) house into a [[Japanese restaurant]]. Shandling also wrote the script for the ''Sanford and Son'' episode, "The Committee Man", in which Fred Sanford represents the community of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] on the Los Angeles Mayor's Committee.  In addition to ''Sanford and Son'', Shandling wrote scripts for the sitcoms ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]]''.

In 1977, Shandling was involved in an auto accident in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] that left him in critical condition for two days.<ref name=people>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20094137,00.html|title=Johnny Carson and Joan Rivers Can Agree on One Thing: Garry Shandling Is Perfect for Her Old Tonight Show Job|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> He later turned the accident into part of his comedy.

==Stand-up comedy==
In an interview, he said that he became a stand-up comedian because he was frustrated by situation comedy's formulaic writing. In 1978, Shandling performed his first stand-up routine at the [[Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles. A year later Shandling was one of the few performers to cross the picket line when a group of comedians organised a boycott against the Comedy Store, protesting owner [[Mitzi Shore]]'s policy of not paying comedians to perform. According to [[William Knoedelseder]], Shandling 'was the scion of a family with...decidedly antiunion views. He had not shared the struggling comic experience. He was a successful sitcom writer trying to break into stand-up, and prior to the strike, Shore had refused to put him in the regular lineup because she didn't think he was good enough. Of course, that changed the minute he crossed the picket line.'<ref>William Knoedelseder (2009), I'm Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-Up Comedy's Golden Era, Public Affairs Books, New York, pp.205-6. [[ISBN 1586488961]]</ref>

His persona was an anxiety-ridden, grimacing, guarded, confused man on the verge of losing control.  After a couple of years on the road, a talent scout from ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' caught his act and booked him to appear as a guest on March 18, 1981. Shandling substituted for Carson on a regular basis until 1987 when he left to focus on his cable show leaving [[Jay Leno]] as permanent guest host and Carson's eventual successor.

In 1984, he performed his first stand-up special, ''Garry Shandling: Alone in Vegas'', for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]],<ref>{{Cite news

Shandling still performs stand-up comedy and tours the U.S. each year. He also continues to perform on various television talk shows. Some of his stand-up performances can be viewed on YouTube, including his first appearance on ''The Tonight Show'' and some of his ''Comic Relief'' act.

==TV series==

===It's Garry Shandling's Show===
Shandling and co-writer [[Alan Zweibel]] went on to create the surreal comedy series ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' in 1985. It ran for 72 episodes on the Showtime cable television network through 1990. The edited reruns played on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] beginning in 1988. Shandling wrote 15 episodes of the show.

The series subverted the standard sitcom format by having its characters openly acknowledge that they were all part of a TV show. Building on a concept that harked back to ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'', in which [[George Burns]] would frequently break the "[[fourth wall]]" and speak directly to the audience, Shandling's show went so far as to incorporate the audience and elements of the studio itself into the storylines, calling attention to the artifice of the show.

The show was nominated for four Emmy awards including one for Shandling. He won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Performance in a Series, and won four CableACE awards, two for Best Comedy Series. The show also won an award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy in the Television Critics Association Awards.

On October 20, 2009, [[Shout! Factory]] released ''It's Garry Shandling's Show: The Complete Series'' on DVD.  The 16-disc set features extensive bonus features including featurettes, commentaries and [[outtakes]]. The first season was released individually on April 15, 2010.

===The Larry Sanders Show===
[[Image:Shandling Rehearsal.jpg|thumb|210px|Shandling during the 1994 Emmy Awards rehearsals.]]
In 1992, Shandling launched another critical and commercial success by creating the mock behind-the-scenes talk show sitcom ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. It ran for 89 episodes through 1998 on the cable network [[HBO]]. It garnered 56 [[Emmy Award]] nominations and three wins. In an interview, he stated that he based the show on his experiences guest hosting ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The show was a behind-the-scenes look at the world of Larry Sanders, fictional host of a talk show entitled ''The Larry Sanders Show''. It sardonically depicted the talk-show business as a den of vipers, with egomaniacal celebrities, clueless network executives, drug addiction, broken marriages, cutthroat competition and comedic camaraderie.

In 1993, NBC offered Shandling $5 million<ref>{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=The War For Late Night|year=2010|isbn=0452297494|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WUyzf2cJzu8C&pg=PT47&dq=NBC+offered+Shandling+$5+million&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4qnUUrSsIcrCyQGcoIHoCg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=NBC%20offered%20Shandling%20%245%20million&f=false}}</ref>  to take over the late-night talk show ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'' when host [[David Letterman]] announced his highly publicized move to [[CBS]], but Shandling declined. He was subsequently offered ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' but also declined in favor of doing ''The Larry Sanders Show'' which at one point [[parody|spoofed]] NBC's efforts to find a Letterman successor, making it appear to be [[Tom Snyder]].

Shandling wrote 38 episodes of the show, and directed three in the show's final season. Shandling was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the show; five for acting, seven for writing and six for being co-executive producer with [[Brad Grey]]. He won one Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing - Comedy Series|Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series]] for the series finale "[[List of The Larry Sanders Show episodes#Season Six|Flip]]". He has also been nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor (Musical or Comedy)]] in 1994 and 1995. He won two [[American Comedy Award]]s for Funniest Male Performance in a Comedy Series, eight [[CableACE]] awards and a [[BAFTA Award]].

It is the most successful show Shandling has created.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The show also influenced other shows such as ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'',  ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' in which guest stars play themselves in episodes of the series.

In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''The Larry Sanders Show'' as 38th Greatest Show of All Time. In 2008, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the show the 28th Best Show of the past 25 years. It was also included on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's 100 Greatest Shows of All Time.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The first season was re-released in 2007 along with a ''Not Just the Best of the Larry Sanders Show'' which are Shandling's pick of the best 23 episodes.

On November 2, 2010, Shout! Factory released ''The Larry Sanders Show: The Complete Series'' on DVD. The 17-disc set features extensive bonus features including featurettes, commentaries and outtakes.

==Other Awards and nominations==
[[Image:Shandling.jpg|thumb|200px|Shandling at the 1992 Emmy awards.]]
He has won two [[British Comedy Awards]], eleven [[CableACE Awards]] (seven for ''The Larry Sanders Show'' and four for ''It's Garry Shandling's Show''), a BAFTA Award and was nominated for two [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s for ''The Larry Sanders Show''. He has also received three [[American Comedy Awards]], two [[Satellite Award]] nominations, and in 2004 he was presented with the [[Austin Film Festival]]'s Outstanding Television Writer Award.

==Other work==
Shandling has appeared occasionally in movies, beginning with a cameo as dental patient Mr. Vertisey in ''[[The Night We Never Met]]''. He played supporting roles in the 1994 films ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'' and ''[[Mixed Nuts]]'', ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'' (1998) as the voice of a live-action [[pigeon]], the [[David Rabe]] play adaptation ''[[Hurlyburly]]'' (1998), and ''[[Trust the Man]]''.  Shandling wrote and starred in director [[Mike Nichols]]' ''[[What Planet Are You From?]]'' (2000), and co-starred with [[Warren Beatty]] and others in ''[[Town & Country (film)|Town & Country]]''. He also appeared in a brief cameo in the comedy film ''[[Zoolander]]'' (2001). Again voicing an animal, Shandling co-starred as Verne the turtle in the [[computer animated]] [[comic strip]] adaptation ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'' (2006). He appeared in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), as Senator Stern and reprised the role in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014).  He appears uncredited as a health inspector in
''[[The Dictator (2012 film)|The Dictator]]'' (2012).

Shandling hosted the [[Grammy Awards]] from 1990 to 1995, and the [[Emmy Awards]] in 2000 and 2004. At the first Emmy hosting job, Shandling cracked up the audience by saying "I auditioned to play the Vice President on ''[[The West Wing]]'', but they said 'No, too Jewish'", a reference to real-life Vice Presidential candidate [[Senator Joe Lieberman]] during the 2000 Presidential campaign. He appeared in ''[[Caroline in the City]]'' in 1998.
