'''Thomas John''' "'''Tom'''" '''Brokaw''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|k|ɔː}}; born February 6, 1940)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/tom-brokaw-9227130|title=Tom Brokaw Biography: News Anchor, Journalist (1940–)|publisher=Biography.com ([[A&E Networks]])|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> is an American television journalist and author best known as the anchor and managing editor of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' from 1982 to 2004. He is the author of ''[[Greatest Generation|The Greatest Generation]]'' (1998) and other books and the recipient of numerous awards and honors.  He is the only person to host all three major [[NBC News]] programs: ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', and, briefly, ''[[Meet the Press]]''. He now serves as a Special Correspondent for NBC News and works on documentaries for other outlets.

Brokaw was born in [[Webster, South Dakota]], the son of Eugenia "Jean" ([[nee]] Conley, November 13, 1917 - November 9, 2011),<ref name="Orange County Register">{{cite web|title=Eugenia Conley Brokaw Obituary |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/orangecounty/obituary.aspx?pid=154559432}}</ref> who worked in sales and as a post-office clerk, and Anthony Orville "Red" Brokaw (1912-1982).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Tom-Brokaw.html |title=Tom Brokaw Biography (1940–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref> He was the eldest of their three sons and was named after his maternal great-grandfather, Thomas Conley. His father was a descendant of [[Huguenot]] immigrants Bourgon and Catherine ([[married and maiden names|nee]] Le Fèvre) Broucard, and his mother was [[Irish-American]].<ref name="STL02">McGuire, John M. (November 6, 2002). "From Yankton to Yankee Town". ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', p. E1.</ref> His paternal great-grandfather, Richard P.

''A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland in the Forties and Fifties'', p. 9. New York: Random House.</ref>

Brokaw's father was a construction foreman for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. He worked at the [[Black Hills Ordnance Depot]] (BHOD) and helped construct [[Fort Randall Dam]]; his job often required the family to resettle during Brokaw's early childhood.<ref name="MidwestToday">Jordan, Larry (February 1995).

As a [[high school]] student attending [[Yankton High School|Yankton Senior High School]],<ref name="Yahoo TV"/> Brokaw was governor of South Dakota [[American Legion]] [[Boys State]], and in that capacity he accompanied then South Dakota Governor [[Joe Foss]] to New York City for a joint appearance on a TV [[game show]]. It was to be the beginning of a long relationship with Foss, whom Brokaw would later feature in his book about World War II [[veterans]], ''The Greatest Generation''. Brokaw also became an Advisory Board member of the [[Joe Foss Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joefossinstitute.org/about-jfi/our-leadership/|website=Joe Foss Institute|title=Our Leadership|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

Tom Brokaw matriculated at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]] but dropped out after a year as he apparently failed to keep up in his studies, in his words majoring in "beer and co-eds"; in tribute to his fun loving freshman year the Airliner Bar has named a booth in his honor.  He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of South Dakota]] in [[Vermillion, South Dakota|Vermillion]] in 1964.<ref name="Yahoo TV">{{cite web|title=Tom Brokaw – Biography|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/tom-brokaw/contributor/213912/bio|publisher=Yahoo! TV|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref>

==Broadcasting career==

===Early years===
Brokaw's television career began at [[KTIV]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] followed by stints at [[KMTV]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Wishart|first=David J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|date=2004|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803247871|page=507|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&pg=PA507&lpg=PA507&dq=KTIV+tom+brokaw&source=bl&ots=IiFXzmBJWw&sig=1tpOEsXugnxNHOgUqjyscfMRBqo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wjczU-uIIsSV2QWf1ID4Ag&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=KTIV%20tom%20brokaw&f=false}}</ref> In 1966, he joined [[NBC News]], reporting from [[California]] and anchoring the 11 p.m. news for [[KNBC|KNBC-TV]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. In 1973, NBC made Brokaw [[White House]] correspondent, covering the [[Watergate scandal]], and anchor of the Saturday editions of ''Nightly News.''  He became host of NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' in 1976 and remained in the job until 1982.

===''Nightly News''===
[[File:BrokawLomaPrietaNakataA.jpg|thumb|right|Brokaw preparing for a live broadcast in the aftermath of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].]]
On April 5, 1982, Brokaw began co-anchoring ''NBC Nightly News'' from New York with [[Roger Mudd]] in Washington.  After a year, NBC News president [[Reuven Frank]] concluded that the dual-anchor program was not working and selected Brokaw to be sole anchor.<ref>Frank, Reuven. ''Out of Thin Air: The Brief Wonderful Life of Network News'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991), pp. 383–84.</ref> The ''NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw'' commenced on September 5, 1983. Among other news items, he covered the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]], [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]], fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and [[Hurricane Andrew]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. He was the only network anchor in [[Berlin]] when the [[Berlin Wall]] fell. He and [[Katie Couric]] hosted a prime-time [[newsmagazine]], ''[[Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric|Now]]'', that aired from 1993–94 before being folded into the multi-night ''Dateline NBC'' program. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Tom Brokaw-1.jpg|thumb|right|Brokaw with [[Vladimir Putin]] before an interview on 2 June 2000.]]
On [[September 11, 2001]], Brokaw joined [[Katie Couric]] and [[Matt Lauer]] around 9:30&nbsp;a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center]], and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw observed:

{{cquote|This is war.  This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20010912owentv4p4.asp|title=Tuned In: This was reality TV at its most horrific|publisher=Post-gazette.com|date= September 12, 2001|accessdate=2008-11-04|first=Rob|last=Owen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n16ArLMUwAE&feature=related|title=NBC World Trade Center Part 12: YouTube (accessed 2009-11-22)|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref>}}

He continued to anchor coverage to midnight on the following two days. Later that month, a letter containing [[anthrax]] was addressed to him as part of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]. Brokaw was not harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected. In 2008, he testified  before the [[Commission on Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism]] about the anthrax attacks, publicly discussing his experiences for the first time in a detailed, day-by-day account.<ref>[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/281113-3 Biological Threat Assessment], c-spanvideo.org; accessed February 19, 2014.</ref>

In 2002, NBC announced that Brokaw would retire as anchor of the ''NBC Nightly News'' following the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]], to be succeeded by [[Brian Williams]]. Brokaw would remain with [[NBC News]] in a part-time capacity through 2014, serving as an analyst and anchoring and producing documentary programs. Brokaw closed his final ''Nightly News'' broadcast in front of 15.7 million viewers on NBC on December 1, 2004, by saying: {{cquote|That's ''Nightly News'' for this Wednesday night. I'm Tom Brokaw. You'll see Brian Williams here tomorrow night; and I'll see you along the way.}}

By the end of his time as ''Nightly News'' anchor, Brokaw was regarded as the most popular news personality in the United States. ''Nightly News'' had moved into first place in the [[Nielsen ratings]] in late 1996<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/03/12/STYLE6031.dtl&type=printable|title=CBS tops Nielsens 2nd week in row|work=SFGate.com|publisher=San Francisco Examiner|date=1997-03-12}}</ref> and held on to the spot for the remainder of Brokaw's tenure on the program, placing him ahead of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Peter Jennings]] and ''[[World News with Charles Gibson|World News Tonight]]'', and [[CBS]]'s [[Dan Rather]] and the ''[[CBS News|CBS Evening News]]''
[[File:TomBrokaw.jpg|thumb|Brokaw in 2006 speaking about the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].]]
Along with Jennings and Rather, Brokaw helped usher in the era of the TV [[news anchor]] as a lavishly compensated, globe-trotting star in the 1980s. The magnitude of a news event could be measured by whether Brokaw and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene. Brokaw's retirement in December 2004, followed by Rather's ouster from the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' in March 2005, and Jennings' death in August 2005, brought that era to a close. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===After ''Nightly News''===
After leaving the anchor chair, Brokaw remained at NBC as Special Correspondent, providing periodic reports for ''Nightly News''.  He served as an NBC analyst during the 2008 presidential election campaign<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/?s=brokaw |title=Inside Cable News |publisher=Insidecable.blogsome.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}</ref> and moderated the second presidential debate between [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] at [[Belmont University]].  He reported documentaries for the Discovery Channel and the History Channel and in 2006 delivered one of the eulogies during the [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|state funeral of former President Gerald R. Ford]].

On June 13, 2008, when NBC interrupted its regular programming to announce the sudden death of NBC News Washington Bureau Chief and ''[[Meet the Press]]'' moderator [[Tim Russert]], Brokaw served as the announcer.  A week later, NBC announced that Brokaw would serve as host of ''Meet the Press'' on an interim basis.  He was succeeded by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] in December 2008.

Brokaw serves on the board of directors of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], the [[International Rescue Committee]] and the [[Mayo Clinic]].  He is also a member of the [[Howard University]] School of Communications Board of Visitors and a trustee of the [[University of South Dakota]], the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the [[International Rescue Committee]]. He also provides the voiceover for a [[University of Iowa]] advertisement that airs on television during [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] athletic events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juniorelitetri.com/the-university-of-iowa-tom-brokaw-and-because-each-student-and-young-with-their-research-should-alt.html |title=The University of Iowa, Tom Brokaw, and because each student (and young) with their research should Alt |publisher=Online University |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On May 29, 2011, Brokaw began hosting ''The Boys in the Hall'', a baseball documentary series for [[Fox Sports Net]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/sportsnewser/fox-sports-net-orders-the-boys-in-the-hall-baseball-series-hosted-by-tom-brokaw_b9678 |title=Fox Sports Net Orders ‘The Boys in the Hall’ Baseball Series, Hosted by Tom Brokaw |publisher=Media Bistro |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref>

In December 2012, Brokaw starred in the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir|Mormon Tabernacle Choir's]] annual Christmas concert, with live audiences of 84,000 and a nationally televised broadcast titled ''[[Home for the Holidays (Mormon Tabernacle Choir album)|Home for the Holidays]]''.[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Mormon-Tabernacle-Choir-names-guest-artists-3943852.php]

==Personal life==
Since 1962, Brokaw has been married to Meredith Lynn Auld, who is an author and former [[Miss South Dakota]].{{cn|date=May 2015}} They have three daughters, Jennifer, Andrea and Sarah.<ref name=daughters>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yHCAbocdc7YC&pg=PR10&dq=tom+brokaw+sarah+jennifer+andrea&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YYlKVdHxIqrksASO-4DwAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tom%20brokaw%20sarah%20jennifer%20andrea&f=false | title=A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland in the Forties and Fifties| first=Tom|last=Brokaw|page = Acknowledgements, x| year=2003| publisher =[[Random House]] Trade Paperbacks| isbn = 978-0375759352}}</ref> He and his wife spend considerable time at their ranch on the  [[Boulder River (Sweet Grass County, Montana)|West Boulder River]] near [[Livingston, Montana]], which they bought in 1989.<ref name=brokaw>{{cite journal|url =http://www.landreport.com/2007/05/the-tom-brokaw-interview-2/|title =The Tom Brokaw Interview|journal=Land Report|last=OKeefe|first=Eric|date = May 1, 2007|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name=brokaw2>{{cite news|url =http://mtstandard.com/business/article_f122d809-db3f-5d5c-913e-ba21f8f394b0.html|title='Big Sky Cooking' |newspaper=Montana Standard|last=Ronnow|first=Karin|date = September 17, 2006|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref>  

On September 6, 2012, Brokaw was hospitalized after appearing on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Morning Joe]]''.  He later tweeted that he was "All well" and explained his illness as having accidentally taken half a dose of [[Ambien]] in the morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/09/tim-brokaw-hospitalized/|title=UPDATE: Tom Brokaw Says He's Fine After Hospital Run|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>
