==Ceremony information==
[[File:Jon Stewart at Cabaret 2008 benefit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Stewart]] hosted the 80th Academy Awards.|alt=Photo of a Jewish male smiling while looking toward his right side and crossing his arms. He is wearing a black coat over a white shirt and a black tie.]]

In September 2007, the Academy hired Gil Cates to oversee production of the telecast for a record 14th time.<ref name="THR">{{cite news|title=Cates to produce Academy Awards|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cates-produce-academy-awards-149925|accessdate=June 28, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=September 11, 2007}}</ref> Ganis explained his decision to hire Cates as producer stating, “He’s so talented…so creative and inventive, and so enormously passionate about the Oscars. All of that will again translate into a night that people can’t wait to experience.”<ref name="THR" /> Immediately, Cates selected actor, comedian, and talk-show host [[Jon Stewart]] as host of the 2008 ceremony. “Jon was a terrific host for the [[78th Academy Awards|78th Awards]],” Cates said about Stewart in a press release. “He is smart, quick, funny, loves movies and is a great guy. What else could one ask for?”<ref>{{cite news|last1=Piccalo|first1=Gina|title=Jon Stewart gets an Oscar sequel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/13/news/wk-stewart13|accessdate=28 June 2014|work=Los Angelest Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=September 13, 2007}}</ref>

Furthermore, the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]] affected the telecast and its surrounding events.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Sandy|title=Awards shows could suffer in WGA strike|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/2007-11-14-award-shows-strike_N.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|accessdate=May 29, 2013|date=November 14, 2007}}</ref> Over a month after the labor dispute began, the striking [[Writers Guild of America, west|Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) denied a waiver requested by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] in connection with film clips and excerpts from previous award ceremonies to be shown at the 2008 awards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNairy|first1=Dave|title=WGA rejects waiver requests|url=http://variety.com/2007/film/news/wga-rejects-waiver-requests-1117977878/|accessdate=July 1, 2014|work=Variety|publisher=PMC|date=December 17, 2007}}</ref> The material could have still been used though, as the denial only affected the conditions under which the clips are shown.<ref>{{cite news | last = Finke | first = Nikki | title = No WGA Waivers For Globes Or Oscars (And Other News From Tonight’s Meeting); AMPTP Nominates WGA For "Worst Union" | work = [[Deadline.com]] | publisher=PMC | date = December 17, 2007 | url = http://www.deadline.com/2007/12/no-wga-waivers-for-golden-globes-oscars/ | accessdate = June 4, 2013}}</ref> Previously, the [[60th Academy Awards|60th ceremony]] held in 1988 occurred 37 days after [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|that year's writers strike]] began.

In anticipation that the strike would continue through Oscar night, the Academy developed a Plan B show that would not have included actors accepting their awards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gensler|first1=Howard|title=Plan B being developed for Oscar night|url=http://articles.philly.com/2008-01-31/entertainment/25253613_1_oscars-leslie-unger-sid-ganis|accessdate=June 30, 2014|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|date=January 31, 2008}}</ref> It would have included the musical numbers, but would have relied heavily on historic film clips, emphasizing the 80th anniversary of the awards.<ref>{{cite news | last = Bierly | first = Mandi | title = Oscars to go on, possibly with 'packages of film and concepts | work = Entertainment Weekly | publisher=Time Warner | date = February 24, 2008 | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/01/31/oscars-jon-stew/ | accessdate = June 4, 2013}}</ref> However, both the WGA and [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP) reached an agreement effectively ending the strike on February 12, 2008, and the ceremony proceeded under its normal format.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=John|last2=Piccalo|first2=Gina|title=Oscars just glad to be scrambling|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/12/entertainment/et-oscars12|accessdate=June 30, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=February 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Breznican|first1=Anthony|title=Writers scramble, but Oscar show will go on|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2008-02-21-oscar-writers_N.htm|accessdate=June 30, 2014|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=February 22, 2008}}</ref>

===Box office performance of nominated films===
Continuing a trend in recent years, the field of major nominees favored independent, low-budget films over blockbusters.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Patrick|title=Once again, the indies will rule|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/23/entertainment/et-oscargoldstein23|accessdate=July 1, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=January 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name="NYT Oscars">{{cite news|last1=Carr|first1=David|title=In Oscars, No Country for Hit Films|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/media/03carr.html|accessdate=July 1, 2014|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 3, 2008}}</ref> The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $217 million; the average gross per film was $43.3 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/oscar/chart/?yr=2007&p=.htm | title=2007 Academy Awards Nominations and Winner for Best Picture |work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}</ref>

None of the five Best Picture nominees was among the top ten releases in box office during the nominations. When the nominations were announced on January 22, ''Juno'' was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $87.1 million in domestic box office receipts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Karger|first1=Dave|title=Blood, Sweat, and Cheers|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20173544,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2008|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Warner|date=February 1, 2008}}</ref> The film was followed by ''No Country for Old Men'' ($48.9 million), ''Michael Clayton'' ($39.4 million), ''Atonement'' ($32.7 million), and finally ''There Will Be Blood'' ($8.7 million).<ref name="BoxOfficeMojoOscars">{{cite news|title=2006 Academy Award Nominations and Winner for Best Picture|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/oscar/chart/?yr=2006&p=.htm|accessdate=January 30, 2014|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}</ref>

Out of the top 50 grossing movies of the year (prior to announcement), 29 nominations went to 12 films on the list. Only ''Ratatouille'' (9th), ''American Gangster'' (18th), ''Juno'' (31st), ''Charlie Wilson's War'' (39th), and ''Surf's Up'' (41st) received nominations for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, directing, acting, or screenwriting.<ref name="boxofficemojooscars">{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?asof=2008-01-21&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=2007&sort=gross&order=DESC&p=.htm |title=2007 Yearly Box Office Results (January 21, 2008) |publisher=Amazon.com |work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> The other top-50 box office hits that earned nominations were ''Transformers'' (3rd), ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' (4th), ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' (7th), ''Enchanted'' (20th), ''Norbit'' (29th), ''The Golden Compass'' (37th), and ''3:10 to Yuma'' (45th).<ref name="boxofficemojooscars" />

===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' television critic [[Tom Shales]] complained the ceremony was "Overstocked with clips from movies -- from this year's nominees and from Oscar winners going back to [[1st Academy Awards|1929]] -- that it was like a TV show with the hiccups."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shales|first1=Tom|title=Oscar Viewers Got Clipped, In More Ways Than One|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/25/AR2008022500046.html|accessdate=July 1, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=February 25, 2008}}</ref> Columnist [[James Poniewozik]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' bemoaned that Stewart was "an Oscar host–sometimes a funny one, but a pretty conventional one, whose routine was loaded up with kiss-up softballs about how hot [[Colin Farrell]] is, what range [[Cate Blanchett]] has and what a tomcat [[Jack Nicholson]] is." Of the show itself, he wrote, "What we got instead was a show that half the time seemed like the show the Academy would have put on if there had been a strike, chockful of montages. The other half of the time, it was an typical-to-dull Oscars."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Poniewozik|first1=James|title=Oscars Defeat Jon Stewart|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2008/02/25/oscars_defeat_jon_stewart/|accessdate=July 1, 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Warner|date=February 25, 2008}}</ref> Columnist Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' complained "Has it ever felt like more of a padded bore than it did Sunday night? If so, blame the writers' strike, which left the producers with only a few weeks to prepare for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast and persuaded them to lean less on the host and more on old clips." He also observed that numerous film montages seemed to diminish Stewart's job as host.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bianco|first1=Robert|title=The Latest Strike Casualty: This Show|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2008-02-25-bianco-review_N.htm|accessdate=February 3, 2014|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=February 25, 2008}}</ref>

The majority of other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television critic Matthew Gilbert of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' gave an average critique of the ceremony but praised Stewart writing that "It was good to see Jon Stewart being Jon Stewart. He is shaping up to be a dependable Oscar host for the post-Billy Crystal years. He's not musical, but he's versatile enough to swing smoothly between jokes about politics, Hollywood, new media, and, most importantly, hair."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Matthew|title=Looking back doesn't help show look good|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/oscars/articles/2008/02/25/looking_back_doesnt_help_show_look_good/|accessdate=September 21, 2008|work=Boston.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 25, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' columnist Brian Lowry lauded Stewart's performance noting that he "earned his keep by maintaining a playful, irreverent tone throughout the night, whether it was jesting about Cate Blanchett’s versatility or watching ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' on an [[iPhone]] screen.<ref name="Variety Oscar" /> [[Frazier Moore]] from the [[Associated Press]] commended Stewart's improvement from his first hosting stint commenting, "He proved equal to the challenge posed by Oscarcast's quick turnaround. His crash-deadline material worked. And even when it didn't, he was genial, relaxed, and seemed utterly at home." In addition, he quipped that although there was a lack of surprise amongst the winners, he marveled "The evening was plenty elegant. The stage setting was handsome. The orchestra sounded full and lush. Everyone behaved."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Frazier|title=The writers were back for the Oscarcast, but this show was nothing to write home about|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/entertainment/movies/the-writers-were-back-for-the-oscarcast-but-this-show/article_fa43baf9-5221-55c5-8f0b-0ff725ee1f51.html|accessdate=November 4, 2008|work=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=February 25, 2008}}</ref>
