===Publishing===
In 1962, when Brown was 40, her book – ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]''<ref name="scanlonix">Scanlon 2009, p. ix.</ref> was published in 28 countries, and stayed on the bestseller lists for over a year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Helen Gurley Brown dies at 90 |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-13/entertainment/sns-201208131726reedbusivarietynvr1118057768-20120813_1_single-girl-gurley-brown-cosmopolitan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69vKrqjIR |archivedate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> In 1964 the book inspired a [[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Natalie Wood]]. In 1965, she became editor-in-chief of ''Cosmopolitan'', which was a literary magazine, famed for publishing high-toned content. She revamped the magazine as ''New Cosmopolitan'' and re-invented it as a magazine for the modern single career women.<ref name=changed>{{cite journal|author=Benjamin, Jennifer|title=How Cosmo Changed the World|publisher=Cosmopolitan|date=September 2009|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world|accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref> In the 1960s, Brown was an outspoken advocate of women's [[Sexual norm|sexual freedom]] and sought to provide them with role models in her magazine. She claimed that women could have it all – "love, sex, and money".  As a result of her advocacy, glamorous, fashion-focused women were sometimes called "Cosmo Girls". Her work played a part in what is often called the [[Sexual revolution#Nonfiction sex manuals|sexual revolution]].

In 1997, Brown was ousted from her role as the U.S. editor of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''<ref name="scanlonxiv">Scanlon 2009, p. xiv.</ref> and was replaced by [[Bonnie Fuller]]. When she left, ''Cosmopolitan'' ranked sixth at the newsstand, and for the 16th straight year, ranked first in bookstores on college campuses.<ref name="scanlonxiv"/>  However, she stayed on at [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] publishing and remained the international editor for all 59 international editions of ''Cosmo'' until her death on August 13, 2012.<ref name="scanlonxiv"/>

In September, 2008, Brown was named the 13th-most-powerful American over the age of 80 by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news |title=80 Over 80: The most powerful octogenarians in America |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=April 22, 2009 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2199926/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69tg4UCal |archivedate=August 13, 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref>
