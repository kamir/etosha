'''Earl Warren''' (March 19, 1891{{spaced ndash}}July 9, 1974) was an American jurist and politician, who served as the 30th [[Governor of California]] (1943–1953) and later the 14th [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (1953–1969).

He is best known for the decisions of the Warren Court, which ended school segregation and transformed many areas of American law, especially regarding the rights of the accused, ending public school-sponsored prayers, and requiring "one man–one vote" rules of apportionment of Congressional, state and local legislative districts.  He made the Supreme Court a power center on a more even basis with Congress and the Presidency, especially through four landmark decisions: ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (1963), ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966).

Warren is the only person ever elected to three consecutive terms as [[Governor of California]], as well as being one of only two people to be elected California's governor three times, the other being [[Jerry Brown]].  Before holding these positions, he was the [[District Attorney]] for [[Alameda County, California]], and the [[California Attorney General|Attorney General of California]].

Warren was the nominee of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]], as the running mate of [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. He was appointed to chair what became known as the [[Warren Commission]], which was formed to investigate the 1963 [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]].

==Education, early career, and military service==
[[File:Earl Warren 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Warren as a U.S. Army First Lieutenant, in 1918.]]
Earl Warren was born in Los Angeles, on March 19, 1891, to Methias H. Warren, a [[Norwegian American|Norwegian]] immigrant whose original family name was Varren,<ref>{{cite book|title=Kern's Movers & Shakers|first1=Camille|last1=Gavin|first2=Kathy|last2=Leverett|year=1987|isbn=0961877006|lccn=87090869|publisher=Kern View Foundation|page=199}}</ref> and Crystal (Hernlund), a [[Swedish American|Swedish]] immigrant. Methias Warren was a longtime employee of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. After the father was [[blacklist]]ed for joining in a strike, the family moved to [[Bakersfield, California]], in 1894. The father worked in a railroad repair yard, and Earl had summer jobs in railroading.

Earl grew up in Bakersfield, where he attended Washington Junior High and Kern County High School (now called [[Bakersfield High School]]). Warren's father was murdered there by an unknown killer during a robbery. Warren graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], earning his B.A. in 1912, political science,<ref>https://warren.ucsd.edu/about/biography.html</ref> and the [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1914. He was a member of [[The Gun Club (secret society)|The Gun Club]] [[secret society]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860019,00.html | work=Time | title=National Affairs: EARL WARREN, THE 14th CHIEF JUSTICE | date=October 12, 1953 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> and the [[Sigma Phi|Sigma Phi Society]], a fraternity with which he maintained lifelong ties. As an undergraduate, Warren also played clarinet in the [[Cal Band]].<ref>http://calbandalumni.berkeley.edu/historybook1993/14/</ref>  Warren maintained a lifelong friendship with fellow Cal student [[Robert Gordon Sproul]], who later became president of [[University of California]]. In 1948, at the Republican National Convention, Sproul would nominate Warren for Vice President. Warren was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the California bar]] in 1914. He was strongly influenced by [[Hiram Johnson]] and other leaders of the [[Progressive Era]] to oppose corruption and promote democracy.{{sfn|White|1982|loc=Ch. 1}}

Warren worked a year for Associated Oil Company in San Francisco, then joined Robinson & Robinson, a law firm in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. In August 1917, Warren enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for [[World War I]] service. Assigned to the [[91st Division (United States)|91st Division]] at [[Fort Lewis|Camp Lewis]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[First Lieutenant#United States|1st Lieutenant]] Earl Warren was discharged in 1918.

==City and District Attorney==
After the war, he served as a clerk of the Judicial Committee for the 1919 Session of the [[California State Assembly]] (1919–1920), and as the Deputy City Attorney of Oakland, California (1920–25). At this time, Warren came to the attention of powerful Republican [[Joseph R. Knowland]], publisher of ''[[The Oakland Tribune]]''. In 1925, Warren was appointed as the [[District Attorney]] of [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]. Warren was re-elected to three four-year terms. Warren vigorously investigated allegations that a deputy sheriff was taking bribes in connection with street-paving arrangements. He was a [[Get tough on crime|tough-on-crime]] District Attorney (1925–1939), who professionalized the DA's office. Warren cracked down on bootlegging and had a reputation for high-handedness, but none of his convictions was overturned on appeal.  When he headed the Warren Court, it declared as unconstitutional some of the standard police techniques for gaining evidence which he and other DAs used as the basis for prosecutions in the 1920s, such as coerced confessions and wiretapping.{{sfn|White|1982|pp=43–44}}

Warren soon gained a statewide reputation as a tough, no-nonsense District Attorney who fought corruption in government; in a 1931 survey, voters listed him as the best District Attorney in the country. He ran his office in a nonpartisan manner, and he strongly supported the autonomy of law enforcement agencies. But he also believed that police and prosecutors had to act fairly. He developed many of his ideas about criminal justice based on his experiences as an active prosecuting attorney.{{sfn|White|1982|loc=Ch. 2}}

==Family and social life==
Warren married Swedish-born widow Nina Elisabeth Palmquist Meyers on October 4, 1925. They had six children. Mrs. Warren died in Washington, at age 100 on April 24, 1993. Warren is the father of Virginia Warren; she married veteran radio and television personality [[John Charles Daly]], on December 22, 1960.

Warren was very active after 1919 in such groups as the [[American Legion]], the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], and the [[Freemasonry|Masons]]. Each one introduced Warren to new friends and political connections.  He rose through the ranks in the Masons, culminating in his election in 1935 as the grand master of the Freemasons for the state of California.  Biographer Jim Newton says that Warren, "thrived in the Masons because he shared their ideals, but those ideals also helped shape him, nurturing his commitment to service, deepening his conviction that society's problems were best addressed by small groups of enlightened, well-meaning citizens. Those ideals knitted together Warren's Progressivism, his Republicanism, and his Masonry."<ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2006|pp=72–73}}</ref>

==Attorney General of California==
In 1938, Warren won the primaries in all major parties as state attorney general, thanks to a system called "cross filing," and was elected without serious opposition. Once elected, he organized state law enforcement officials into regions and led a statewide anti-crime effort. One of his major initiatives was to crack down on [[gambling ship]]s operating off the coast of [[Southern California]].{{sfn|White|1982|pp=44–67}}

===Japanese-American internment===
As Attorney General, Warren is most remembered for being the moving force behind [[Japanese American internment|Japanese internment]] during World War II. This was the compulsory removal of 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent from the West Coast to inland internment camps, without any charges or due process - when anti-Japanese racism was extremely popular in California.  Following the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Warren organized the state's civilian defense program, warning in January 1942 that, "The Japanese situation as it exists in this state today may well be the Achilles heel of the entire civilian defense effort."{{sfn|White|1982|p=69}}{{sfn|White|1982|p=71|postscript=. His biographer says Warren was "The most visible and effective California public official advocating internment."}} He later said he: 
{{quote|since deeply regretted the removal order and my own testimony advocating it, because it was not in keeping with our American concept of freedom and the rights of citizens...Whenever I thought of the innocent little children who were torn from home, school friends, and congenial surroundings, I was conscience-stricken...[i]t was wrong to react so impulsively, without positive evidence of disloyalty |''The Memoirs of Earl Warren'' (1977)<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Unacknowledged Lesson: Earl Warren and the Japanese Relocation Controversy |author=G. Edward White |work=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]] |date=Autumn 1979| pages=613–629 |url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1979/autumn/white-unacknowledged-lesson/ |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}</ref>}}

==Governor of California==
[[File:Earl Warren Portrait, half figure, seated, facing front, as Governor.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo as Governor of California]]

Running as a Republican, Warren was elected Governor of California on November 3, 1942, defeating incumbent [[Culbert Olson]], a liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Thanks to [[cross-filing]], he won all the 1946 primaries and was nominated as a candidate by both the Republican and Democratic parties, the only California governor to have done so.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rodda |first=Richard |title=The Not-Always-Accurate Memoirs of Earl Warren |journal=California Journal |date=November 1977 |pages=378–379 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/CalJournal-1977nov-00378 |accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> He was re-elected with over 90% of the vote against minor candidates. He was elected to a third term (as a Republican) in 1950 becoming the first person elected governor of California three times. Warren is the only person who has been sent to office in three consecutive California gubernatorial elections. An amendment passed in 1990 sets a limit of two terms for governor. (In 2010, [[Jerry Brown]] became the second person to be elected three times, in 1974, 1978, and [[California gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]]; Brown was elected to a record fourth term in 2014. As he served before the amendment was passed, he was not prohibited from serving another term.)

[[File:Earl Warren with young miner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Governor Warren meets a young "gold miner" as part of the California centennials, 1948–50]]
As governor, Warren modernized the office of governor, and state government generally. Like most [[Progressive Era|progressives]], Warren believed in [[Efficiency Movement|efficiency]] and planning. During [[World War II]], he aggressively pursued postwar economic planning. Fearing another postwar decline that would rival the depression years, Governor Earl Warren initiated public works projects similar to those of the [[New Deal]] to capitalize on wartime tax surpluses and provide jobs for returning veterans. Warren also built up the state's higher education system based on the University of California and its vast network of small universities and community colleges.<ref>{{cite journal|first=John Aubrey|last=Douglass|title=Earl Warren's New Deal: Economic Transition, Postwar Planning, and Higher Education in California|journal=[[Journal of Policy History]]|year=2000|volume=12|issue=4|pages=473–512|doi=10.1353/jph.2000.0029}}</ref> For example, his support of the Collier-Burns Act in 1947 raised gasoline taxes that funded a massive program of freeway construction. Unlike states where tolls or bonds funded highway construction, California's gasoline taxes were earmarked for building the system. Warren's support for the bill was crucial because his status as a popular governor strengthened his views, in contrast with opposition from trucking, oil, and gas lobbyists. The Collier-Burns Act helped influence passage of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]], setting a pattern for national highway construction.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Daniel J. B.|last=Mitchell|title=Earl Warren's Fight for California's Freeways: Setting a Path for the Nation|journal=[[Southern California Quarterly]]|year=2006|volume=88|issue=2|pages=205–238|doi=10.2307/41172311}}</ref>

Warren ran for Vice President of the United States in [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]] on the Republican ticket with [[Thomas E. Dewey]], his gubernatorial counterpart from the state of New York. Heavily favored to win, they lost in a stunning upset to the incumbent Democratic President [[Harry S. Truman]] and his VP running mate [[Alben W. Barkley]].

==U.S. Supreme Court==
[[File:EarlWarren.jpg|thumb|Chief Justice Earl Warren]]

===Appointed to Supreme Court===
In [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]], Warren stood as a "[[favorite son]]" candidate of California for the Republican nomination for President, hoping to be a power broker in a convention that might be deadlocked. But Warren had to head off a revolt by Senator [[Richard Nixon]], who supported General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  Eisenhower and Nixon were elected, and the bad blood between Warren and Nixon was apparent. Eisenhower offered, and Warren accepted, the post of solicitor general, with the promise of a seat on the Supreme Court. But before it was announced, Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] died suddenly in September 1953 and Eisenhower picked Warren to replace him as [[Chief Justice of the United States]].{{sfn|White|1982|pp=148|postscript=. White says it was not as payoff for campaign work.}}<ref>{{harvnb|Abraham|1992|p=255}}. But Abraham suggests Ike owed Warren some gratitude. Eisenhower said he owed Warren nothing.</ref>

The president wanted what he felt was an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren "represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court.... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court".<ref>[http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/presidential-papers/first-term/documents/460.cfm Personal and confidential To Milton Stover Eisenhower, 9 October 1953. In ''The Papers of Dwight David Eisenhower'', ed. L. Galambos and D. van Ee, (1996) doc. 460.]</ref> In the next few years, Warren led the Court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court. Eisenhower is often said to have remarked that his appointment was "the biggest fool mistake I ever made."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/democracy/robes_warren.html]</ref> Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith countered this perception by stating, "The problem is that Eisenhower never said that. I have no evidence that he ever made such a statement."<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeam Edward|last=Smith|title=Eisenhower in War and Peace|year=2012|publisher=Random House|page=603N}}</ref> Eisenhower gave Warren a recess appointment that began on October 1, 1953. It was made permanent when the Senate acted on March 1, 1954. No serious opposition had appeared and he was confirmed by unanimous voice vote.<ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2006|pages=280–292}}</ref>

As of 2013, Warren was the last Supreme Court justice to have served as governor of a U.S. state, the last justice to have been elected to statewide elected office, and the last serving politician to be elevated to the Supreme Court.

As Chief Justice, Warren swore in President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his second inauguration in 1957 and his successor John F Kennedy in 1961.  However, Warren did not swear in Kennedy's successor Lyndon B. Johnson when he first became President, because Warren was not immediately available at the time of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  Warren would eventually swear in Johnson at his inauguration in 1965, and his one-time rival Nixon in 1969.

===The Warren Court===
[[File:President & First Lady Kennedy with Chief Justice Earl Warren & Mrs. Warren, circa 1962.jpg|thumb|President and Mrs. Kennedy with Chief Justice and Mrs. Warren, November 1963]]
{{main|Warren Court}}
Warren took his seat October 5, 1953, on a recess appointment; the Senate confirmed him on March 1, 1954. Despite his lack of judicial experience, his years in the Alameda County district attorney's office and as state attorney general gave him far more knowledge of the law in practice than most other members of the Court had. Warren's greatest asset, what made him in the eyes of many of his admirers "Super Chief," was his political skill in manipulating the other justices. Over the years his ability to lead the Court, to forge majorities in support of major decisions, and to inspire liberal forces around the nation, outweighed his intellectual weaknesses. Warren realized his weakness and asked the senior associate justice, [[Hugo L. Black]], to preside over conferences until he became accustomed to the drill.  A quick study, Warren soon was in fact, as well as in name, the Court's chief justice.{{sfn|White|1982|pp=159–161}}

All the justices had been appointed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] or Truman, and all were committed [[New Deal coalition|New Deal liberals]].  They disagreed about the role that the courts should play in achieving liberal goals. The Court was split between two warring factions. [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Robert H. Jackson]] led one faction, which insisted upon judicial self-restraint and insisted courts should defer to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O. Douglas]] led the opposing faction; they agreed the court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy, but felt the judicial agenda had been transformed from questions of property rights to those of individual liberties, and in this area, courts should play a more activist role. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the activists, although he did not have a solid majority until after Frankfurter's retirement in 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Belknap|2005|pp=13–14}}</ref>

Constitutional historian Melvin I. Urofsky concludes that "Scholars agree that as a judge, Warren does not rank with [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Hugo Black|Black]], or [[William J. Brennan Jr.|Brennan]] in terms of jurisprudence. His opinions were not always clearly written, and his legal logic was often muddled."<ref>{{cite book|first=Melvin I.|last=Urofsky|chapter=Warren, Earl|title=Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 9|year=1994|page=838}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Lawrence S.|last=Wrightsman|title=The Psychology of the Supreme Court|year=2006|page=211}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Priscilla Machado|last=Zotti|title=Injustice for All: Mapp vs. Ohio and the Fourth Amendment|year=2005|page=11}}</ref> His strength lay in his public gravitas, his leadership skills and in his firm belief that the Constitution guaranteed natural rights and that the Court had a unique role in protecting those rights.<ref>{{cite book|first=Melvin I.|last=Urofsky|title=The Warren Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy|year=2001|page=157|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Powe|2000|pp=499–500}}</ref>

[[Conservatism in the United States|Political conservatives]] attacked his rulings as inappropriate and have called for courts to be deferential to the elected political branches. [[Modern liberalism in the United States|Political liberals]] sometimes argued<ref>{{harvnb|Urofsky|2001|p=xii}} says "But sometimes it went too far, and the work of the Burger Court in part consisted of correcting those excesses."</ref>{{sfn|Powe|2000|p=101|postscript=. Powe reports "a fear not only among conservatives but among moderates as well as some liberals that the Justices had gone too far in protecting individual rights and in so doing had moved into the legislative domain."}} that the Warren Court went too far in some areas, but insist that most of its controversial decisions struck a responsive chord in the nation and have become embedded in the law.{{sfn|Powe|2000|loc=Ch. 19}}{{Dubious|date=February 2011}}

====Decisions====
Warren was a more liberal justice than anyone had anticipated.<ref>In later years, Eisenhower remarked several times that making Warren the Chief Justice was a mistake. He probably had the criminal cases in mind, not ''Brown.''  See {{cite book|first=David. A.|last=Nichols|title=Matter of Justice: Eisenhower and the Beginning of the Civil Rights Revolution|year=2007|pages=91–93}}</ref> Warren was able to craft a long series of landmark decisions because he built a winning coalition.  When Frankfurter retired in 1962 and President [[John F. Kennedy]] named labor lawyer [[Arthur Goldberg]] to replace him, Warren finally had the fifth liberal vote for his majority. [[William J. Brennan Jr.]], a liberal Democrat appointed by Eisenhower in 1956, was the intellectual leader of the activist faction that included Black and Douglas. Brennan complemented Warren's political skills with the strong legal skills Warren lacked. Warren and Brennan met before the regular conferences to plan out their strategy.{{sfn|Powe|2000}}

=====''Brown'' (1954)=====
''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' {{ussc|347|483|1954}} banned the segregation of public schools.
The very first case put Warren's leadership skills to an extraordinary test. The [[NAACP]] had been waging a systematic legal fight against the "separate but equal" doctrine enunciated in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) and finally had challenged Plessy in a series of five related cases, which had been argued before the Court in the spring of 1953. However the justices had been unable to decide the issue and ordered a reargument of the case in fall 1953, with special attention to whether the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause prohibited the operation of separate public schools by the states for whites and blacks.<ref>See [http://americanhistory.si.edu/Brown/history/index.html Smithsonian, “Separate is Not Equal: Brown v. Board of Education’’]</ref>

While all but one justice personally rejected segregation, the self-restraint faction questioned whether the Constitution gave the Court the power to order its end, especially since the Court, in several cases decided after Plessy, had upheld the doctrine of "separate but equal" as constitutional.<ref>See, e.g., ''[[Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education]]'', ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'', ''[[Gong Lum v. Rice]]'', ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'', and ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]''</ref> The activist faction believed the Fourteenth Amendment did give the necessary authority and were pushing to go ahead. Warren, who held only a recess appointment, held his tongue until the Senate, dominated by southerners, confirmed his appointment.  Warren told his colleagues after oral argument that he believed racial segregation violated the Constitution and that only if one considered African Americans inferior to whites could the practice be upheld. But he did not push for a vote.  Instead, he talked with the justices and encouraged them to talk with each other as he sought a common ground on which all could stand. Finally he had eight votes, and the last holdout, [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]] of Kentucky, agreed to join the rest. Warren drafted the basic opinion in ''Brown v. Board of Education'' (1954) and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by all the members of the Court.<ref>For text see [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=347&invol=483 BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)]</ref>

The unanimity Warren achieved helped speed the drive to desegregate public schools, which mostly came about under President [[Richard Nixon]]. Throughout his years as Chief, Warren succeeded in keeping all decisions concerning segregation unanimous. Brown applied to schools, but soon the Court enlarged the concept to other state actions, striking down racial classification in many areas. Congress ratified the process in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Warren did compromise by agreeing to Frankfurter's demand that the Court go slowly in implementing desegregation; Warren used Frankfurter's suggestion that a 1955 decision (''Brown II'') include the phrase "all deliberate speed."<ref>{{cite journal|first=Robert L.|last=Carter|title=The Warren Court and Desegregation|journal=[[Michigan Law Review|Mich. L. Rev.]]|volume=67|issue=2|date=December 1968|pages=237–248|jstor=1287417}}</ref>

The ''Brown'' decision of 1954 marked, in dramatic fashion, the radical shift in the Court's—and the nation's—priorities from issues of property rights to civil liberties. Under Warren the courts became an active partner in governing the nation, although still not coequal. Warren never saw the courts as a backward-looking branch of government.

The Brown decision was a powerful moral statement clad in a weak constitutional analysis; Warren was never a legal scholar on a par with Frankfurter or a great advocate of particular doctrines, as was Black. Instead, he believed that in all branches of government common sense, decency, and elemental justice were decisive, not stare decisis, tradition or the text of the Constitution.  He wanted results. He never felt that doctrine alone should be allowed to deprive people of justice. He felt racial segregation was simply wrong, and ''Brown'', whatever its doctrinal defects, remains a landmark decision primarily because of Warren's interpretation of the equal protection clause to mean that children should not be shunted to a separate world reserved for minorities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|title=Brown v. Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy|year=2001}}</ref>

=====Reapportionment=====
The "[[one man, one vote#United States|one man, one vote]]" cases (''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'') of 1962–1964 had the effect of ending the sometimes gross malapportionment of state legislative chambers, to the political detriment of those who lived in more densely populated areas.

Warren's priority on fairness shaped other major decisions. In 1962, over the strong objections of Frankfurter, the Court agreed that questions regarding malapportionment in state legislatures were not political issues, and thus were not outside the Court's purview. For years, underpopulated rural areas had an equal voice in the state legislatures in the Senate where Los Angeles County had only one state senator just like Siskiyou County.  Cities had long since passed their peak, and now it was the middle class suburbs that were underrepresented. Frankfurter insisted that the Court should avoid this "political thicket" and warned that the Court would never be able to find a clear formula to guide lower courts in the rash of lawsuits sure to follow. But Douglas found such a formula: "one man, one vote."<ref>{{cite journal|first=James A.|last=Gazell|title=One Man, One Vote: Its Long Germination|journal=[[The Western Political Quarterly]]|volume=23|issue=3|date=September 1970|pages=445–462|jstor=446565|doi=10.1177/106591297002300301}}</ref>

In the key apportionment case, ''Reynolds v. Sims'' (1964),<ref>See [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=377&invol=533 REYNOLDS v. SIMS, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)]</ref> Warren delivered a civics lesson: "To the extent that a citizen's right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen," Warren declared. "The weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives. This is the clear and strong command of our Constitution's Equal Protection Clause." Unlike the desegregation cases, in this instance, the Court ordered immediate action, and despite loud outcries from rural legislators,  Congress failed to reach the two-thirds needed to pass a constitutional amendment. The states complied, reapportioned their legislatures quickly and with minimal troubles. Numerous commentators have concluded reapportionment was the Warren Court's great "success" story.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Robert B.|last=McKay|title=Reapportionment: Success Story of the Warren Court|journal=[[Michigan Law Review|Mich. L. Rev.]]|volume=67|issue=2|date=December 1968|pages=223–236|jstor=1287416}}</ref>

=====Due process and rights of defendants (1963–66)=====
In ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}} the Court held that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] required that all indigent criminal defendants receive publicly funded counsel (Florida law, consistent with then-existing Supreme Court precedent reflected in the case of [[Powell v. Alabama]], required the assignment of free counsel to indigent defendants only in capital cases);
''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', {{ussc|384|436|1966}} required that certain rights of a person interrogated while in police custody be clearly explained, including the right to an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] (often called the "[[Miranda warning]]").

While most Americans eventually agreed that the Court's desegregation and apportionment decisions were fair and right, disagreement about the "due process revolution" continues into the 21st century.  Warren took the lead in criminal justice; despite his years as a tough prosecutor, he always insisted that the police must play fair or the accused should go free. Warren was privately outraged at what he considered police abuses that ranged from warrantless searches to forced confessions.

Warren's Court ordered lawyers for indigent defendants in ''Gideon v. Wainwright'' (1963), and prevented prosecutors from using evidence seized in illegal searches, in ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' (1961). The famous case of ''Miranda v. Arizona'' (1966) summed up Warren's philosophy.<ref>See [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=384&invol=436 MIRANDA v. ARIZONA, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)]</ref> Everyone, even one accused of crimes, still enjoyed constitutionally protected rights, and the police had to respect those rights and issue a specific warning when making an arrest. Warren did not believe in coddling criminals; thus in ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'' (1968) he gave police officers leeway to stop and frisk those they had reason to believe held weapons.

Conservatives angrily denounced the "handcuffing of the police."<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Ronald|editor1-last=Kahn|editor2-first=Ken I.|editor2-last=Kersch|title=The Supreme Court and American Political Development|year=2006|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0700614397?keywords=miranda%20%26%2334%3Bcrime%20rates%26%2334%3B&p=S04N&checkSum=%252FyIgYm2ybgibk6P%252BM%252FG9LcucFd6ieUBSkCM%252FVsFiLs0%253D|pages=442}}</ref> They attacked Warren using official FBI statistics that showed violent crime and homicide rates shooting up nationwide; in New York City, for example, after steady to declining trends until the early 1960s, the homicide rate doubled in the period from 1964 to 1974 from just under 5 per 100,000 at the beginning of that period to just under 10 per 100,000 in 1974. After 1992 the homicide rates fell sharply.<ref>{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Sowell|title=The Vision of the Anointed: Self-congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy|year=1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ISTtFtcIkKAC&pg=PA29&dq=homicide+%22warren+court%22&lr=&num=30&as_brr=0&ei=BvhqSNuHHpOkiwHp99SCBg&sig=ACfU3U2Pv3ET0J8J_NHq2uTqH_GJxcCbDw|pages=26–29}}</ref>

=====First Amendment=====
The Warren Court's activism stretched into a new turf, especially First Amendment rights. The Court's decision outlawing mandatory school prayer in ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) brought vehement complaints that continue to the present.<ref>See [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=370&invol=421 ENGEL v. VITALE, 370 U.S. 421 (1962)]</ref>

Warren worked to nationalize the [[Bill of Rights]] by applying it to the states. Moreover, in one of the landmark cases decided by the Court, ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1963), the Warren Court announced a constitutionally protected [[right of privacy]].<ref>See [http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZS.html Griswold v. Connecticut (No. 496) 151 Conn. 544, 200 A.2d 479, reversed]</ref>

With the exception of the desegregation decisions, few decisions were unanimous. The eminent scholar Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] took Frankfurter's place as the Court's self-constraint spokesman, often joined by [[Potter Stewart]] and [[Byron R. White]]. But with the appointment of [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first black justice, and [[Abe Fortas]] (replacing Goldberg), Warren could count on six votes in most cases.{{sfn|Belknap|2005}}

===Retirement delayed===
In June 1968, Warren, fearing that Nixon would be elected president that year, worked out a retirement deal with President Johnson. Associate Justice [[Abe Fortas]], who was secretly Johnson's top adviser, brokered the deal in which Fortas would become chief justice. The plan was foiled by the Senate, which ripped into Fortas's record and refused to confirm him. Warren remained on the Court, and Nixon was elected. In 1969 Warren learned that Fortas had made a secret lifetime contract for $20,000 a year to provide private legal advice to [[Louis Wolfson]], a friend and financier in deep legal trouble; Warren immediately asked Fortas to resign.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Artemus|last=Ward|title=An Extraconstitutional Arrangement: Lyndon Johnson and the Fall of the Warren Court|journal=White House Studies|year=2002|volume=2|issue=2|pages=171–183}}</ref>

Warren presided over the Court's October 1968 term and retired in spring 1969; Nixon named [[Warren E. Burger]] to succeed him. Burger, despite his distinguished profile and conservative reputation, was not effective in stopping Brennan's liberalism, so the "Warren Court" remained effective until about 1986, when [[William Rehnquist]] became Chief Justice and took control of the agenda.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stephen L.|last=Wasby|title=Civil Rights and the Supreme Court: A Return of the Past|journal=[[National Political Science Review]]|date=July 1993|volume=4|pages=49–60}}</ref>

===Warren Commission===
{{main|Warren Commission}}
President Johnson demanded in the name of patriotic duty that Warren head the governmental commission that investigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It was an unhappy experience for Warren, who did not want the assignment. As a judge, he valued candor and justice, but as a politician he recognized the need for secrecy in some matters. He insisted that the commission report should be unanimous, and so he compromised on a number of issues in order to get all the members to sign the final version. Many conspiracy theorists have attacked the commission's findings ever since, claiming that key evidence is missing or distorted and that there are many inconsistencies in the report.  The Commission concluded that the assassination was the result of a single individual, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], acting alone.<ref>''The Warren Commission Report: Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy by President's Commission on The Assassination'' (1964)</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2006|pages=415–423, 431–442}}</ref> Fears of possible Soviet or Cuban foreign involvement in the assassination necessitated the establishment of a bipartisan commission that, in turn, sought to depoliticize Oswald's role by downplaying his Communist affiliations. The commission weakened its findings by not sharing the government's deepest secrets. The report's lack of candor furthered antigovernment cynicism, which in turn stimulated conspiracy theorists who propounded any number of alternative scenarios, many of which appear mutually contradictory.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Max|last=Holland|title=The Key to the Warren Report|journal=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|date=November 1995|volume=46|issue=7|pages=50–59|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/key-warren-report}}</ref><ref>Earl Warren was portrayed by real life [[New Orleans]] district attorney [[Jim Garrison]] in ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', the [[Oliver Stone]] film about the assassination and Garrison's investigation of it.</ref>

==Legacy==
Earl Warren had a profound impact on the Supreme Court and United States of America. As Chief Justice, his term of office was marked by numerous rulings on civil rights, separation of church and state, and police arrest procedure in the United States.

His critics found him a boring person. "Although Warren was an important and courageous figure and although he inspired passionate devotion among his followers...he was a dull man and a dull judge," wrote Dennis J. Hutchinson.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hail to the Chief: Earl Warren and the Supreme Court|first=Dennis J.|last=Hutchinson|journal=[[Michigan Law Review|Mich. L. Rev.]]|volume=81|pages=922, 930|year=1983}}</ref>

[[File:Impeach Warren.png|thumb|right|An "Impeach Earl Warren sign," posted in San Francisco in October 1958]]

Warren retired from the Supreme Court in 1969. He was affectionately known by many as the "Superchief", although he became a lightning rod for controversy among [[Conservatism|conservatives]]: signs declaring "[[Impeachment|Impeach]] Earl Warren" could be seen around the country throughout the 1960s. The unsuccessful impeachment drive was a major focus of the [[John Birch Society]]<ref>Political Research Associates, [http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/jbs.html "John Birch Society"]</ref> and sparked the political activism of [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] and [[Southern Baptist]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Jerry Falwell]]<ref>"Republican Gomorrah. p. 147. Max Blumenthal. ISBN 978-1-56858-398-3</ref> who would later found the [[Moral Majority]] [[political action committee]], partially in response to U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] questioning the tax exempt status of ''de facto'' segregation within [[segregation academies|private schools]] during the late 1970s.

As Chief Justice, he swore in presidents Eisenhower (in 1957), Kennedy (in 1961), Johnson (in 1965) and Nixon (in 1969).

===Death===
Five years after his retirement, Warren died in Washington, D.C., on July 9, 1974.<ref name="warren1">{{cite web |title=Earl Warren (1891–1974) |publisher=Earl Warren College |url=http://warren.ucsd.edu/aboutwarren/college_overview/earl_warren.php |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071018095528/http://warren.ucsd.edu/aboutwarren/college_overview/earl_warren.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = October 18, 2007}}</ref> His funeral was held at [[Washington National Cathedral]] and his body was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=Bob |authorlink=Bob Woodward |author2=Scott Armstrong |title=The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court |publisher=Siomn & Schustler |year=2005 |location=New York City |page=385 |isbn=0-7432-7402-4}}</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fWQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YW0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3968,1815893&dq=earl-warren&hl=en "Earl Warren Buried In Arlington Cemetery"], Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Washington (AP), July 13, 1974, page 3.</ref> Warren is one of two former California governors whose final funeral services took place in Washington, D.C., the other being [[Ronald Reagan]] whose final funeral service was his [[State funeral of Ronald Reagan|state funeral]], held thirty years later, also at Washington National Cathedral.

===Honors===
On December 5, 2007, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and First Lady of California [[Maria Shriver]] inducted Warren into the [[California Hall of Fame]], located at [[The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts]].<ref>[http://www.californiamuseum.org/Exhibits/Hall-of-Fame/inductees.html Warren inducted into California Hall of Fame], California Museum, Accessed 2007</ref>
The [[Earl Warren Bill of Rights Project]] is named in his honor. He was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] posthumously in 1981. An extensive collection of Warren's papers, including case files from his Supreme Court service, is located at the Manuscript Division of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. Most of the collection is open for research.

[[File:Earl Warren Hall Mongolian Oak.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Earl Warren Hall at [[University of California, Berkeley]] was designed to architecturally accommodate this [[Mongolian Oak]].<ref name="berkeleyTrees">{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/multimedia/2004/01/notable.swf |title=Notable Trees of Berkeley |format=flash |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>]]
A number of educational and governmental institutions have been named for Warren. In 1977, Fourth College, one of the six [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] colleges at the [[University of California, San Diego]], was renamed [[Earl Warren College]] in his honor. The California State Building in San Francisco; [[Earl Warren Middle School]] in [[Solana Beach, California]]; elementary schools in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Lake Elsinore, California]]; a junior high school in his home town of Bakersfield, California; high schools in [[San Antonio, Texas]] ([[Earl Warren High School]]), and [[Downey, California]] ([[Warren High School (Downey, California)|Warren High School]]); and a building at the high school he attended (Bakersfield High School) are named for him, as are the showgrounds in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. The freeway portion of [[California State Route 13|State Route 13]] in Alameda County is the Warren Freeway. The Warren Reading Room at Boalt Hall was also named in his honor.

He was honored by the [[United States Postal Service]] with a 29¢ [[Great Americans series]] postage stamp.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Smithsonian Postal Museum |title=29-cent Warren|url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&mode=1&tid=2037014}}</ref>
