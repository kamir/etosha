'''David Khari Webber "Dave" Chappelle'''<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Henry T. Chappelle|publisher=''Yellow Springs News''|date=March 1991}}</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|l}}, born August 24, 1973) is an American [[comedian]], [[screenwriter]], [[television producer|television]] and [[film producer]], and actor. After beginning his film career in 1993 as Ahchoo in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'', he landed minor roles in box office hits including ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[Con Air]]'', and ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]''.  His first lead role was in the 1998 comedy film ''[[Half Baked]]'', directed by [[Tamra Davis]] and co-written by [[Neal Brennan]] and Chappelle himself.

In 2003, he became more widely known for his [[sketch comedy]] television series, ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', co-written with [[Neal Brennan]], which ran until his retirement from the show two years later.  By 2006, Chappelle was called "''the'' comic genius of America" by ''Esquire''<ref name="esquire"/> and, in 2013, "the best" by a ''Billboard'' writer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/1532254/chappelles-show-10-best-musical-sketches|title= Chappelle's Show: 10 Best Musical Sketches|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref> The show continues to run in popular late-night syndication and on television networks around the world.

==Early life==
Chappelle was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], on August 24, 1973, the youngest of three.<ref name="esquire">{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0506CHAPPELLE_92|title=Heaven Hell Dave Chappelle|publisher=''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]''|author=Powell, Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Powell|date=2006-04-30|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> His father, William David Chappelle III, worked as a statistician before becoming a professor at [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]].<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/> His mother, Yvonne (née Reed), was a professor at [[Howard University]], [[Prince George's Community College]], and the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and is also a [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]].<ref name="nytimesItzkoff" /> Chappelle also has a stepmother and a stepbrother.<ref name=esquire/>

Chappelle grew up in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], and attended [[Woodlin Elementary School]].<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/> His parents were politically active, and the family house was visited by notable individuals including [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Johnny Hartman]].<ref name=esquire/> The latter predicted he would be a comedian and, around this time, Chappelle's comic inspiration came from [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Richard Pryor]]. After his parents separated, Chappelle stayed in Washington with his mother while spending summers with his father in [[Ohio]]. In 1991, he graduated from Washington's [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]], where he studied [[theatre arts]].<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/>

==Early career==
Chappelle moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career as a comedian. He gathered the courage to perform at [[Harlem]]'s famed [[Apollo Theater]] in front of the infamous "Amateur Night" audience, but he was  [[booing|boo]]ed off stage.  Chappelle described the experience as the moment that gave him the courage to continue his show business aspirations.<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/> He quickly made a name for himself on the New York comedy circuit, even performing in the city's parks.  [[Whoopi Goldberg]] nicknamed him "The Kid."<ref name="esquire"/> At 19, he made his film debut as "Ahchoo" in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]''.  He also appeared on Star Search three times but lost over competing comedian [[Lester Barrie]]; Dave later joked about the irony of him subsequently becoming more successful than Barrie.  The same year, Chappelle was offered the role of Benjamin Buford "Bubba" Blue in ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.  Concerned the character was demeaning and the movie would bomb, he turned down the part.<ref name="ajc2007">Staff report (August 23, 2007).

He attracted the attention of TV network executives and developed numerous [[television pilot|pilot]]s, but none were picked up for series.<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/><ref name=freedom>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/60II/main650149.shtml|title = Chappelle: 'An Act Of Freedom'|publisher= ''[[60 Minutes II]]'', [[CBS News]]|author=Leung, Rebecca|date=December 29, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-16}}</ref> In 1995, he made a guest appearance on an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s popular [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.

However, after taping a pilot episode, Jim Breuer was fired and replaced with actor [[Christopher Gartin]].  ''Buddies'' premiered in March 1996 to disappointing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].  The show was cancelled after only five episodes out of 13 that were produced.

After the failure of ''Buddies'', Chappelle starred in another pilot.  According to Chappelle, the network was uncomfortable with the [[African-American]] cast and wanted [[White American|white]] actors added.<ref name="varietyhontz">{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/tv-s-race-card-1117478261/|title=TV’s race card|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=Hontz, Jenny|date=1998-07-08|accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref> Chappelle resisted and subsequently accused the network of racism.  Shortly afterwards, Chappelle's father died and he returned to Ohio, considering leaving the entertainment business.<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/><ref name=freedom/>

He later appeared as a nightclub comedian in the 1996 comedy ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' starring [[Eddie Murphy]], one of his major comedic influences.  The movie grossed nearly $129 million on a budget of $54 million.<ref name="boxofficenutty">{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nuttyprofessor.htm|title=The Nutty Professor (1996)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> He had a minor role in 1997's ''[[Con Air]]'' which made $26 million after production costs.<ref name="boxofficecon">{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=conair.htm|title=Con Air (1997)|publisher=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> At the beginning of 1998, he did a stand-up performance for HBO Comedy Half-Hour. That same year, he appeared in "Pilots and Pens Lost," a 1998 episode of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'''s sixth season, in which he and the executives of the show's unnamed [[television network]] satirized the treatment to which scriptwriters and show creators were subjected, as well as the executives' knee-jerk tendencies toward racial stereotypes.<ref name="ifclarry">[http://www.ifc.com/shows/the-larry-sanders-show/episodes/season-6/pilots-and-pens-lost "Season 6, Episode 4: Pilots and Pens Lost"].

He and [[Neal Brennan]] co-wrote the 1998 [[cult film|cult]] [[stoner film]] ''[[Half Baked]]'', Chappelle's first starring role, about a group of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-smoking friends trying to get their other friend out of jail.  It made money at the box office and remains a classic so-called "stoner" film (a genre that includes the "Cheech and Chong" films as well as more recent fare like [[Judd Apatow]]'s ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'').<ref name="ewstoner">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20362224_20445193,00.html|title=Stoner Flicks: 20 'High-Rated' Faves|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | first1=Whitney|last1=Pastorek|first2=Jeff|last2=Labrecque|date=April 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name="mjcommovies">{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuana.com/news/2013/05/top-10-marijuana-movies-from-up-in-smoke-to-half-baked-hollywood-loves-pot-flicks/|title=Top 10 Marijuana Movies: From "Up In Smoke" to "Half Baked" Hollywood Loves Pot Flicks|publisher=Marijuana.com}}{{deadlink|date=March 2015}}</ref> In December 1998, Chappelle appeared as [[Tom Hanks]]' character's friend and confidant in ''[[You've Got Mail]]''.

In 2000, Chappelle recorded his first hour-long [[HBO]] special, ''Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly'', in [[Washington, DC]].

==2003–2006: Standup and ''Chappelle's Show''==
{{main|Chappelle's Show}}
In 2003, Chappelle debuted his own weekly [[sketch comedy]] show on [[Comedy Central]] called ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.  The show parodied many aspects of American culture, including [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]], politics and [[pop culture]].  Along with comedy skits, the show also featured musical performances by mostly [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[soul (music)|soul]] artists.

Due to the show's popularity, Comedy Central's new parent company [[Viacom]]<ref name=esquire/> reportedly offered Chappelle a $55 million contract (giving Chappelle a share of DVD sales) to continue production of ''Chappelle's Show'' for two more years, while allowing him to do side projects.  Chappelle has said that sketches are not his favorite form of comedy,<ref name=esquire/> and that the characteristics of the show's format were somewhat like [[short film]]s.

In June 2004, based on the popularity of the "[[Rick James]]" sketch, it was announced that Chappelle was in talks to portray James in a [[biopic]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], also owned by Viacom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1488300/06102004/story.jhtml|title = Dave Chappelle Is Rick James, Bitch!|publisher= [[MTV News]]|first = Alyssa|last = Rashbaum|date=June 10, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> James's estate disagreed with the proposed comical tone of the film and put a halt to the talks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955707.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title = Turner to script singer James's biopic|publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first = Michael|last = Fleming|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref>

That same month, Chappelle recorded his second comedy special, this time airing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], ''Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth'', at [[San Francisco]]'s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]], where his idols, including [[Lenny Bruce]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], and [[Robin Williams]], had performed.  He joked about the city being "the gayest place on earth," touched upon an encounter on a public bus, in a New Mexico Wal-Mart, smoking in a strip club, and cultural differences in food and other topics.

===Season 3 turbulence===
In a June 2004 stand-up performance in [[Sacramento, California]], Chappelle walked off the stage after berating his audience for constantly shouting "I'm [[Rick James]], bitch!", which became a [[catchphrase]] from his popular "Rick James" sketch.  After a few minutes, Chappelle returned and resumed by saying, "The show is ruining my life."  He stated that he disliked working "20 hours a day" and that the popularity of the show was making it difficult for him to continue his stand-up career, which was "the most important thing" to him.  He told the audience:

{{quote|You know why my show is good?  Because the network officials say you're not smart enough to get what I'm doing, and every day I fight for you. I tell them how smart you are. Turns out, I was wrong.

Season 3 was scheduled to air on May 31, 2005, but in that month, Chappelle stunned fans and the entertainment industry when he abruptly left during production of the third season of ''Chappelle's Show'' and took a trip to South Africa.<ref name="esquire"/> Chappelle said that he was unhappy with the direction the show had taken.

{{quote|Coming here, I don't have the distractions of fame. It quiets the ego down. I'm interested in the kind of person I've got to become.

Immediately following Chappelle's departure, tabloids quickly and repeatedly speculated that Chappelle's exit was driven by drug addiction or a mental health issue, rather than ethical or personal concerns.<ref name="Time"/> In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]], Chappelle expressed his contempt for the entertainment industry's tone-deafness toward black entertainers and audiences:

{{quote|When I see that they put every black man in the movies in a dress at some point in their career, I start connecting the dots.<ref name="oprah" /><ref name="vice2014">{{cite web|title=Power - The Evolution of Black Masculinity Through Fashion |url=http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/power-0000227-v21n2|publisher=[[Vice Magazine]] | date=March 3, 2014 |accessdate=March 27, 2014|author=Wilbert L.

The break from Comedy Central also meant a rift with longtime collaborator [[Neal Brennan]].<ref name=esquire/>

===''Dave Chappelle's Block Party''===
[[File:Broken Angel House.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|The site of ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'' in [[Brooklyn]].]]
Chappelle was the star and a [[Film producer|producer]] of the [[Michel Gondry]]-directed documentary ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'', which chronicles him hosting a free concert in the [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn|Clinton Hill]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] on September 18, 2004.<ref name=esquire/> Several musical artists, including [[Kanye West]], [[The Roots]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Mos Def]], [[Dead Prez]] and [[Jill Scott]], are featured in the movie both performing in the concert and in conversation off-stage.  He brought Yellow Springs residents to Brooklyn at his own expense.<ref name=esquire/> Another surprising highlight of the event was the (temporary) reunion of popular 1990s [[hip-hop]] group [[The Fugees]].<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/360/wyclef_jean_perfect_gentelman/ "Wyclef Jean interview by Pete Lewis"].

Chappelle toured several cities in February and March 2006 to promote the film under the name "Block Party All-Stars featuring Dave Chappelle".  [[Universal Pictures]]' genre division, [[Rogue Pictures]], released the film in the U.S. on March 3, 2006.

Chappelle said on ''Inside the Actors Studio'' that the death of his father seven years prior had an impact on his decision to go to South Africa.  By throwing himself into his work, he had not taken a chance to mourn his father's death.  He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa.<ref name="InsideActorsStudio"/> He said,

During these interviews, Chappelle did not rule out returning to ''Chappelle's Show'' to "finish what we started," but promised that he would not return without changes to the production, such as a better working environment.  He desired to donate half of the DVD sales to charity.<ref name="oprah" /> Chappelle expressed disdain at the possibility of his material from the unfinished third season being aired, saying that to do so would be "a bully move," and that he would not return to the show if Comedy Central were to air the unfinished material.<ref name="CNN" /> On July 9, 2006, Comedy Central aired the first episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes]]''.  An uncensored DVD release of the episodes was made available on July 25.

The show still plays in syndication on several television networks, despite the relatively small number of episodes compared to most American syndicated television programs.<ref name="Wisniewski2009" />

===2007–present===
In April 2007, Chappelle set a stand-up endurance record at the [[Laugh Factory]] Sunset Strip comedy club, beating comedian [[Dane Cook]]'s record of three hours and 50 minutes.

The main results are that the linguistic features typically associated with the ethnic group in question are strengthened and exaggerated in order for the viewers to determine the characters’ ethnic origin more easily, and that the characters are often displayed as racial stereotypes.
