===Radio and stage career===
During the late 1940s, Van Dyke was a [[radio DJ]] in [[Danville, Illinois]]. In 1947, Van Dyke was persuaded by Phil Erickson to form a comedy duo with him called "Eric and Van—the Merry Mutes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=vandykedic |title=Van Dyke, Dick{{spaced ndash}} The Museum of Broadcast Communications |publisher=Museum.tv |date= October 21, 1992 |accessdate= December 11, 2011}}</ref> The team toured the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] nightclub circuit, performing a mime act and [[lip synching]] to old [[Gramophone record|78 records]].

In November 1959, Van Dyke made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''The Girls Against the Boys''. He then played the lead role of Albert Peterson in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', which ran from April 14, 1960 to Oct 7, 1961. In a May 2011 interview with [[Rachael Ray]], Van Dyke noted that when he auditioned for a smaller part in the show he had no dance experience, and that after he sang his audition song he did an impromptu soft-shoe out of sheer nervousness. [[Gower Champion]], the show's director and [[choreographer]], was watching, and promptly went up on stage to inform Van Dyke he had the lead. An astonished Van Dyke protested that he could not dance, to which Champion replied "We'll teach you". That musical won four Tony awards including Van Dyke's [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Featured Actor Tony]], in 1961.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/dick-van-dyke|title=Masterworks Broadway/Dick Van Dyke|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|year=2011 }}</ref>  In 1980, Van Dyke appeared as the title role in the first  Broadway revival of ''[[The Music Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodyear|first=Dana|title=SUPERCALIFRAGILISTIC|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/12/13/101213ta_talk_goodyear|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=December 13, 1910}}</ref>

===Television career===

Dick Van Dyke's start in television was with [[WDSU-TV]] [[New Orleans]] Channel 6 ([[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]), first as a single comedian and later as [[emcee]] of a comedy program.<ref>[http://www.wyes.org/programs/localprod/goldenage/goldenage_about.html ''New Orleans TV: The Golden Age''], documentary produced by [[WYES-TV]] New Orleans Channel 12, broadcast July 18, 2009; published at WYES.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.wdsu.com/community/267718/detail.html | title = WDSU Serves New Orleans Since 1948}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Dave | last = Walker | publisher = Arcadia | url = http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/news_article.html?id=1429 | title = That old-time TV: New book celebrates 60 years of local stars}}.</ref> Van Dyke's first network TV appearance was with [[Dennis James]] on James' ''[[Chance of a Lifetime (1950s TV series)|Chance of a Lifetime]]'' in 1954.  He later appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' during its 1957–58 season. He also appeared early in his career on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'' and [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s ''[[The Polly Bergen Show]]''.  During this time a friend from the Army was working as an executive for CBS television and recommended Van Dyke to that network.  Out of this came a seven-year contract with the network.<ref name = King2010 /> During an interview on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Wait Wait...

From 1961 to 1966, Van Dyke starred in the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] sitcom ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', in which he portrayed a comedy writer named Rob Petrie. Originally the show was supposed to have Carl Reiner as the lead but CBS insisted on recasting and Reiner chose Van Dyke to replace him in the role.<ref name = King2010 /> Complementing Van Dyke was a veteran cast of comic actors including [[Rose Marie]], [[Morey Amsterdam]], [[Jerry Paris]], [[Ann Morgan Guilbert]], [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]], and [[Carl Reiner]] (as Alan Brady), as well as television newcomer [[Mary Tyler Moore]], who played Rob's wife, [[Laura Petrie]]. Van Dyke won three [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]s as [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor - Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]], and the series received four [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Awards as Outstanding Comedy Series]].<ref name="museum">[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=vandykedic museum.tv].</ref>

From 1971 to 1974, Van Dyke starred in an unrelated sitcom called ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in which he starred as a local television talk show host. He received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance but the show was less successful than its predecessor,<ref>Brooks, Tim; Earl Marsh (2003). ''[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows]]''. [[Ballantine Books]].

The following year, he received an Emmy Award nomination for his role as an alcoholic businessman in the [[television movie]] ''[[The Morning After (1974 film)|The Morning After]]'' (1974). Van Dyke revealed after its release that he had recently overcome a [[Alcoholism|real-life drinking problem]].

Van Dyke returned to comedy in 1976 with the [[sketch comedy]] show ''Van Dyke and Company,'' which co-starred [[Andy Kaufman]]<ref>''Van Dyke and Company''</ref> and [[Super Dave Osborne]]. Despite being canceled after three months, the show won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Series.<ref name="museum" /> After a few guest appearances on the long-running comedy-variety series ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', Van Dyke became a regular on the show, in the fall of 1977. However, he only appeared in half of the episodes of the final season. For the next decade he appeared mostly in TV movies. One atypical role was as a murdering judge on the second episode of the TV series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' in 1986 starring [[Andy Griffith]]. In 1987, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Airwolf]]'', with his son [[Barry Van Dyke]], who was the lead star of the show's fourth and final season on [[USA Network]]. In 1989, he guest-starred on the NBC comedy series ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' portraying a lover of [[Beatrice Arthur]]'s character. This role earned him his first Emmy Award nomination since 1977.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/hollywoodpresents/gingame/about/bios.html pbs.org]</ref>

His film work affected his TV career: the reviews he received for his role as D.A. Fletcher in ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' led him to star as the character Dr. Mark Sloan first in an episode of ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', then in a series of TV movies on CBS that became the foundation for his popular television drama ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]].''  The series ran from 1993 to 2001 with son [[Barry Van Dyke]] co-starring in the role of Dr. Sloan's son [[Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan]]. Also starring on the same show was a familiar daytime soap actress, [[Victoria Rowell]], as Dr. Sloan's pathologist/medical partner, [[Dr. Amanda Bentley]], and an unfamiliar character actor and lifelong Van Dyke fan, [[Charlie Schlatter]], in the role of Dr. Sloan's handsome, resident student, [[Dr. Jesse Travis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universalchannel.co.uk/shows/diagnosis-murder-s8 |title=Diagnosis Murder S8 &#124; Universal Channel UK |publisher=Universalchannel.co.uk |date= December 13, 1925 |accessdate= February 29, 2012}}</ref> Van Dyke continued to find television work after the show ended, including a dramatically and critically successful performance of ''[[The Gin Game]]'', produced for television in 2003 that reunited him with [[Mary Tyler Moore]]. In 2003, he portrayed a doctor on ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. A 2004 special of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' titled ''The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited'' was heavily promoted as the first new episode of the classic series to be shown in 38 years. Van Dyke and his surviving cast members recreated their roles; the program was roundly panned by critics.  In 2006 he guest-starred as [[college professor]] Dr. Jonathan Maxwell for a series of ''[[Murder 101 (TV film series)|Murder 101]]'' mystery films on the [[Hallmark Channel]].

===Film career===
[[File:Mary Poppins3.jpg|thumb|250px|Dick Van Dyke in the 1964 film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'']]
Van Dyke began his film career by playing the role of Albert J. Peterson in the film version of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' (1963). Despite his unhappiness with the adaptation&mdash;its focus differed from the stage version in that the story now centered on a previously supporting character<ref>Van Dyke was unhappy because it became a vehicle for [[Ann-Margret]], see "Dick Van Dyke Dances Through Life", Bill Keveney, ''[[USA Today]]'', April 28, 2011.</ref>—the film was a success. That same year, Van Dyke was cast in two roles: as the chimney sweep Bert, and as bank chairman Mr. Dawes Senior, in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964). For his scenes as the chairman, he was heavily costumed to look much older, and was credited in that role as "Nackvid Keyd" (at the end of the credits, the letters [[anagram|unscramble]] into "Dick Van Dyke"). Van Dyke's attempt at a [[cockney]] accent has been decried as one of the worst accents in film history, cited by actors since as an example of how not to sound. In a 2003 poll by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine of the worst-ever accents in film, he came in second.<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Connery 'has worst film accent' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3032052.stm | publisher =[[BBC News]] | date= June 30, 2003| accessdate= July 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7509572.stm "How not to do an American accent"].

"[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]", one of the songs that Van Dyke performed in ''Mary Poppins'', won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the [[Sherman Brothers]], the film's songwriting duo.

Many of the comedy films Van Dyke starred in throughout the 1960s were relatively unsuccessful at the box office, including ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'', ''[[Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.]]'', ''[[Fitzwilly]]'', ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'', ''[[Some Kind of a Nut]]'', ''[[Never a Dull Moment (1968 film)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', and ''[[Divorce American Style]]''. But he also starred (with his native accent, despite the English setting) as [[Caractacus Pott]] in the successful musical ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968), which co-starred [[Sally Ann Howes]] and featured the same songwriters (The Sherman Brothers) and choreographers ([[Marc Breaux]] and Dee Dee Wood) as ''Mary Poppins''.

In 1969, Van Dyke appeared in the comedy-drama ''[[The Comic]]'', written and directed by [[Carl Reiner]]. Van Dyke portrayed a self-destructive [[Silent film|silent-film]] era comedian who struggles with [[alcoholism]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], and his own rampant ego. Reiner wrote the film especially for Van Dyke, who often spoke of his admiration for silent-film era comedians such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and his hero [[Stan Laurel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/353393%7C0/The-Comic.html |title=The Comic |publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] |date= January 8, 1998 |accessdate= January 28, 2012}}</ref> Twenty-one years later in 1990, Van Dyke, whose usual role had been the amiable hero, took a small but villainous turn as the crooked D.A.
