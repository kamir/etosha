The [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (also known as the North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more [[conventional warfare|conventional war]], at times committing large units to battle.

As the war continued, the part of the Viet Cong in the fighting decreased as the role of the NVA grew. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] and overwhelming firepower to conduct [[search and destroy]] operations, involving [[Army|ground forces]], [[artillery]], and [[airstrike]]s. In the course of the war, the U.S. conducted a large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaign against North Vietnam, and over time the North Vietnamese airspace became the most heavily defended in the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The U.S. government viewed its involvement in the war as a way to prevent a Communist takeover of South Vietnam. This was part of a wider [[containment policy]], with the stated aim of stopping the spread of communism. The North Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. They viewed the conflict as a [[colonial war]], fought initially against forces from France and then America, and later against South Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/vietnam/index.cfm |title=The Vietnam War |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu|accessdate=31 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>

Beginning in 1950, American [[military advisor]]s arrived in what was then [[French Indochina]].<ref>Major General George S. Eckhardt, ''[http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/Comm-Control/index.htm Vietnam Studies Command and Control 1950–1969]'', Department of the Army, Washington, D.C.

Regular U.S. [[Military organization|combat units]] were deployed beginning in 1965. Operations crossed international borders: bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were heavily bombed by U.S. forces as American involvement in the war peaked in 1968, the same year that the communist side launched the [[Tet Offensive]]. The Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government but became the turning point in the war, as it persuaded a large segment of the United States population that its government's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam.

Gradual withdrawal of U.S. ground forces began as part of as "[[Vietnamization]]", which aimed to end American involvement in the war while transferring the task of fighting the Communists to the South Vietnamese themselves. Despite the [[Paris Peace Accord]], which was signed by all parties in January 1973, the fighting continued. In the U.S. and the Western world, a large [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]] developed as part of a larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].

==Names for the war==
{{further2|[[Terminology of the Vietnam War]]}}
Various names have been applied to the conflict. ''Vietnam War'' is the most commonly used name in English. It has also been called the ''Second Indochina War'' and the ''Vietnam Conflict''.

As there have been several conflicts in Indochina, this particular conflict is known by the names of its primary protagonists to distinguish it from others.<ref>Moore, Harold. G and Joseph L. Galloway ''We Are Soldiers Still: A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam'' (p. 57).</ref> In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the war is generally known as ''Kháng chiến chống Mỹ'' (Resistance War Against America). It is also called ''Chiến tranh Việt Nam'' (The Vietnam War).<ref>{{cite web|title=Asian-Nation: Asian American History, Demographics, & Issues:: The American / Viet Nam War|quote=The Viet Nam War is also called 'The American War' by the Vietnamese |url=http://www.asian-nation.org/vietnam-war.shtml |accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

The primary military organizations involved in the war were, on one side, the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) and the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], and, on the other side, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) (more commonly called the North Vietnamese Army, or NVA, in English language sources), and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, more commonly known as the [[Viet Cong]] in English language sources), a South Vietnamese communist guerrilla force.<ref>Tucker, Spencer C.

In 1940, during World War II, the [[Battle of France|French were defeated by the Germans]]. The [[Vichy France|French State]] (commonly known as Vichy France) was established as a [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. The French colonial authorities, in French Indochina, sided with the Vichy regime. In September 1940, Japan [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invaded Indochina]]. Following the cessation of fighting and the beginning of the Japanese occupation, the French colonial authorities collaborated with the Japanese. The French continued to run affairs in Indochina, but ultimate power resided in the hands of the Japanese.<ref name = "Neale 2001 17"/>

The Viet Minh was founded as a league for independence from France, but also opposed Japanese occupation in 1945 for the same reason. The U.S. and Chinese Nationalist Party supported them in the fight against the Japanese.<ref name = "Tucker 1999 42">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1999|p=[http://books.google.com/?id=WZry2NaH2_sC&pg=PA42 42]}}</ref> However, they did not have enough power to fight actual battles at first. Viet Minh leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] was suspected of being a communist and jailed for a year by the Chinese Nationalist Party.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brocheux|2007|p=198}}</ref>

Double occupation by France and Japan continued until the German forces were expelled from France and the French Indochina colonial authorities started holding secret talks with the [[Free French Forces|Free French]]. Fearing that they could no longer trust the French authorities, the Japanese army interned the French authorities and troops on 9 March 1945<ref name = "Neale 2001 18">{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|p=18}}.</ref> and created the [[puppet state|puppet]] [[Empire of Vietnam]] state, under [[Bảo Đại]] instead.

During 1944–1945, a [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945|deep famine]] struck northern Vietnam due to a combination of bad weather and French/Japanese exploitation (French Indochina had to supply grains to Japan).<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last=Koh |url= http://mailman.anu.edu.au/pipermail/hepr-vn/2008-August/000188.html |date=21 August 2008|title=Vietnam needs to remember famine of 1945 |newspaper=The Straits Times |location =Singapore }}</ref> Between 400,000 and 2 million<ref name="Hirschman"/> people died of starvation (out of a population of 10 million in the affected area).<ref name = "Neale 2001 18_19">{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|pp=18–9}}.</ref> Exploiting the administrative gap<ref name="Kolko, Gabriel page 36">{{Harvnb|Kolko|1985|p=36}}.</ref> that the internment of the French had created, the Viet Minh in March 1945 urged the population to ransack rice warehouses and refuse to pay their taxes.<ref name = "Neale 2001 19">{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|p=19}}.</ref> Between 75 and 100 warehouses were consequently raided.<ref name = "Neale 2001 20">{{Harvnb|Neale|2001|p=20}}.</ref> This rebellion against the effects of the famine and the authorities that were partially responsible for it bolstered the Viet Minh's popularity and they recruited many members during this period.<ref name="Kolko, Gabriel page 36"/>

On 22 August 1945, following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]], [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agents [[Archimedes Patti]] and [[Carleton B.

During August the Japanese forces remained inactive as the Viet Minh and other nationalist groups took over public buildings and weapons, which began the [[August Revolution]]. OSS officers met repeatedly with [[Ho Chi Minh]] and other [[Viet Minh]] officers during this period<ref>Interview with Archimedes L. A. Patti, 1981, http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-bf3262-interview-with-archimedes-l-a-patti-1981</ref> and on 2 September 1945 Ho Chi Minh declared the [[independence|independent]] [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] before a crowd of 500,000 in [[Hanoi]].<ref name = "Neale 2001 20"/> In an overture to the Americans, he began his speech by paraphrasing the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]: "All men are created equal.

The Viet Minh took power in Vietnam in the [[August Revolution]].<ref name = "Neale 2001 20"/> According to [[Gabriel Kolko]], the Viet Minh enjoyed large popular support,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kolko|1985|p=37}}.</ref> although Arthur J.

The Viet Minh received crucial support from the Soviet Union and PRC. PRC support in the [[First Indochina War|Border Campaign of 1950]] allowed supplies to come from the PRC into Vietnam.

Declassified Politburo documents confirm that 1 in 1,000 North Vietnamese (i.e., about 14,000 people) were the minimum quota targeted for execution during the earlier "[[Land reform in North Vietnam|rent reduction]]" campaign; the number killed during the multiple stages of the considerably more radical "[[Land reform in North Vietnam|land reform]]" was probably many times greater.<ref>Alec Holcombe, [http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/vs.2010.5.2.243?searchUrl=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Ffilter%3Djid%253A10.2307%252Fj50000660%26Query%3Drent%2Breduction%26wc%3Don%26Search.x%3D0%26Search.y%3D0&Search=yes&uid=3739656&uid=367529381&uid=2134&uid=2&uid=70&uid=3&uid=3739256&uid=60&sid=21101672198221 Politburo's Directive Issued on 4 May 1953, on Some Special Issues regarding Mass Mobilization] ''[[Journal of Vietnamese Studies]]'', Vol. 5, No. 2 (Summer 2010), pp. 243–247, quoting a translated Politburo directive from 4 May 1953.

The south, meanwhile, constituted the State of Vietnam, with Bảo Đại as Emperor and [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] (appointed in July 1954) as his prime minister. Neither the United States government nor Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam signed anything at the [[1954 Geneva Conference]]. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate [[Phạm Văn Đồng]],<ref>''[[The Pentagon Papers]]'' (1971), [[Beacon Press]], vol. 3, p. 134.</ref> who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of "local commissions".<ref>''The Pentagon Papers'' (1971), Beacon Press, vol. 3, p. 119.</ref> The United States countered with what became known as the "American Plan", with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom.<ref name="The Pentagon Papers 1971 p. 140">''The Pentagon Papers'' (1971), Beacon Press, vol. 3, p. 140.</ref> It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation.<ref name="The Pentagon Papers 1971 p. 140"/> The United States said, "With respect to the statement made by the representative of the State of Vietnam, the United States reiterates its traditional position that peoples are entitled to determine their own future and that it will not join in any arrangement which would hinder this".<ref>''The Pentagon Papers'' (1971), Beacon Press, vol. 3, pp. 570–71.</ref>

[[President Eisenhower]] wrote in 1954, "I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable in Indochinese affairs who did not agree that had elections been held as of the time of the fighting, possibly eighty percent of the population would have voted for the Communist [[Ho Chi Minh]] as their leader rather than Chief of State Bảo Đại. Indeed, the lack of leadership and drive on the part of Bảo Đại was a factor in the feeling prevalent among Vietnamese that they had nothing to fight for."<ref>[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].

South Vietnam, which had not signed the Geneva Accords, did not believe the Communists in North Vietnam would allow a fair election. In January 1957, the International Control Commission (ICC), comprising observers from India, Poland, and Canada, agreed with this perception, reporting that neither South nor North Vietnam had honored the armistice agreement. With the French gone, a return to the traditional power struggle between north and south had begun again.''"</ref>

From April to June 1955, Diệm eliminated any political opposition in the south by launching military operations against two religious groups: the [[Cao Đài]] and [[Hòa Hảo]] of [[Ba Cụt]]. The campaign also focused on the [[Bình Xuyên]] [[organized crime]] group which was allied with members of the communist party secret police and had some military elements. As broad-based opposition to his harsh tactics mounted, Diệm increasingly sought to blame the communists.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam on 23 October 1955, Diệm [[electoral fraud|rigged]] the poll supervised by his brother [[Ngô Đình Nhu]] and was credited with 98.2 percent of the vote, including 133% in Saigon. His American advisors had recommended a more modest winning margin of "60 to 70 percent." Diệm, however, viewed the election as a test of authority.<ref name = "Karnow 1997 224">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=224}}.</ref> Three days later, he declared South Vietnam to be an independent state under the name Republic of Vietnam (ROV), with himself as president.<ref>Gerdes (ed.)

A devout [[Roman Catholic]], Diệm was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative. Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes that "Diệm represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and [[nepotism]]."<ref name = "McNamara 1999 200_201">{{Harvnb|McNamara|1999|pp=200–1}}.</ref> The majority of Vietnamese people were [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and were alarmed by actions such as Diệm's dedication of the country to the [[Virgin Mary]].

Beginning in the summer of 1955, Diệm launched the "Denounce the Communists" campaign, during which communists and other anti-government elements were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, or executed. He instituted the death penalty against any activity deemed communist in August 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent14.htm |title=The Pentagon Papers Gravel Edition Volume 1, Chapter 5, "Origins of the Insurgency in South Vietnam, 1954–1960" |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref> According to [[Gabriel Kolko]] about 12,000 suspected opponents of Diệm were killed between 1955 and 1957 and by the end of 1958 an estimated 40,000 [[political prisoner]]s had been jailed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kolko|1985|p=89}}.</ref> However, [[Guenter Lewy]] argues that such figures were exaggerated and that there were never more than 35,000 prisoners of all kinds in the whole country.<ref name = "Lewy 1978 294_295">{{Harvnb|Lewy|1978|pp=294–5}}.</ref>

In May 1957, Diệm undertook a [[Ngô Đình Diệm presidential visit to the United States|ten-day state visit to the United States]]. President Eisenhower pledged his continued support, and a parade was held in Diệm's honor in New York City. Although Diệm was publicly praised, in private Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] conceded that Diệm had been selected because there were no better alternatives.<ref name = "Karnow 1997 230">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=230}}.</ref>

Former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] wrote in ''Argument Without End'' (1999) that the new American patrons of the [[Republic of Vietnam|ROV]] were almost completely ignorant of Vietnamese culture. They knew little of the language or long history of the country.<ref name = "McNamara 1999 377_379"/> There was a tendency to assign American motives to Vietnamese actions, and Diệm warned that it was an illusion to believe that blindly copying Western methods would solve Vietnamese problems.<ref name = "McNamara 1999 377_379"/>

===Insurgency in the South, 1954–60===
{{Main|Viet Cong|War in Vietnam (1959–63)}}
[[File:HoCMT.png|thumb|right|upright=.9|The [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] was used to supply the Viet Cong.]]
Between 1954 and 1957 there was large-scale but disorganized dissidence in the countryside which the Diệm government succeeded in quelling. In early 1957 South Vietnam had its first peace in over a decade. However, by mid-1957 through 1959 incidents of violence increased but the government "did not construe it as a campaign, considering the disorders too diffuse to warrant committing major GVN [Government of Vietnam] resources." By early 1959 however, Diệm considered it an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.<ref>[http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html Excerpts from Law 10/59, 6 May 1959].</ref> There had been some division among former Viet Minh whose main goal was to hold the elections promised in the Geneva Accords, leading to "[[wildcat strike|wildcat]]" activities separate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists.<ref name="WarBegan" />

In December 1960, the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (NLF, a.k.a. the Viet Cong) was formally created with the intent of uniting all anti-GVN activists, including non-communists. According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the Viet Cong "placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence, on land reform and liberalization of the GVN, on [[coalition government]] and the neutralization of Vietnam." Often the leaders of the organization were kept secret.<ref name="WarBegan" />

The reason for the continued survival of the NLF was the class relations in the countryside. The vast majority of the population lived in villages in the countryside where the key issue was land reform. The [[Viet Minh]] had reduced rents and debts; and had leased communal lands, mostly to the poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back to the villages. People who were farming land they held for years now had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent. This rent collection was enforced by the South Vietnamese army. The divisions within villages reproduced those that had existed against the French: ''"75 percent support for the NLF, 20 percent trying to remain neutral and 5 percent firmly pro-government,"''<ref>Marilyn Young, The Vietnam Wars: 1945—1990 (New York: Harper Perennial, 1991), p. 73</ref>

====North Vietnamese involvement====
Sources disagree on whether North Vietnam played a direct role in aiding and organizing South Vietnamese rebels prior to 1960. Kahin and Lewis assert:

{{quote|Contrary to United States policy assumptions, all available evidence shows that the revival of the civil war in the South in 1958 was undertaken by Southerners at their own—not Hanoi's—initiative…Insurgency activity against the Saigon government began in the South under Southern leadership not as a consequence of any dictate from Hanoi, but contrary to Hanoi's injunctions.<ref name="WarBegan" />}}

Similarly, historian [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] states that "it was not until September, 1960 that the Communist Party of North Vietnam bestowed its formal blessing and called for the liberation of the south from American imperialism".<ref name="WarBegan" />

By contrast, Jeffery Race interviewed communist defectors who found such denials "very amusing", and who "commented humorously that the Party had apparently been more successful than was expected in concealing its role."<ref>Jeffrey Race, ''War Comes to Long An'' (University of California Press, 1972), pp107, 122.</ref> James Olson and Randy Roberts assert that North Vietnam authorized a low-level insurgency in December 1956.<ref name = "Olson Roberts 1991 67"/> To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Viet Cong was stressed in communist propaganda.<ref name="Ang16">{{cite book |first=Cheng Guan |last=Ang |title=The Vietnam War from the Other Side |url=http://books.google.com/?id=4OgLBUXHikIC|year=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=0-7007-1615-7 |pages=16, 58, 76}}</ref>

In March 1956, southern communist leader [[Lê Duẩn]] presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled "The Road to the South" to the other members of the Politburo in Hanoi, but as both China and the Soviets opposed confrontation at this time, Lê Duẩn's plan was rejected.<ref name="Ang16"/> However the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive the southern insurgency in December 1956.<ref name = "Olson Roberts 1991 67+comment">{{Harvnb|Olson|Roberts|1991|p=67}}.{{cnf|date=September 2013}}<br/>This decision was made at the 11th Plenary Session of the Lao Dong Central Committee.</ref> Communist forces were under a single command structure set up in 1958.<ref name="Victory68">Military History Institute of Vietnam,(2002) ''Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954–1975'', translated by Merle L.

==Kennedy years, 1961–63==
{{Main|Strategic Hamlet Program|Phạm Ngọc Thảo}}
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960 U.S. presidential election]], Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated incumbent Vice President [[Richard Nixon]]. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America "loomed larger than Asia on his sights."<ref name = "Karnow 1997 264">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=264}}.</ref> In his inaugural address, Kennedy made the ambitious pledge to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty."<ref>The Avalon Project at Yale Law School. ''[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/kennedy.asp Inaugural Address of John F. Kennedy].''</ref> In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.-Soviet issues.

The Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in Korea, and Kennedy faced a three-part crisis&nbsp;– the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]], and a negotiated settlement between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=265}}: "Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers."</ref> These crises made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to "draw a line in the sand" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna meeting with Khrushchev, "Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place."<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F. Kennedy and Vietnam Presidential Studies Quarterly].</ref><ref>Mann, Robert. ''A Grand Delusion'', Basic Books, 2002.</ref>

In May 1961, U.S. Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Diệm the "[[Winston Churchill]] of Asia."<ref name = "Karnow 1997 267">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=267}}.</ref> Asked why he had made the comment, Johnson replied, "Diệm's the only boy we got out there."<ref name = "Karnow 1997 230"/> Johnson assured Diệm of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.

Kennedy's policy toward South Vietnam rested on the assumption that Diệm and his forces had to ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own. He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that "to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences."<ref>{{Harvnb|VTF|1969|loc=IV. B. 4., pp.&nbsp;[http://media.nara.gov/research/pentagon-papers/Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-B-4.pdf 1–2]}}</ref>
The quality of the South Vietnamese military, however, remained poor. Poor leadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in weakening the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN). The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the Viet Cong played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.<ref name = "McNamara 1999 369">{{Harvnb|McNamara|1999|p=369}}.</ref>
[[File:South Vietnam Map.jpg|thumb|right|[[South Vietnam]], Military Regions, 1967]]

One major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using [[special forces]] for [[counterinsurgency]] warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a "brush fire" war in Vietnam.

Kennedy advisors [[Maxwell D. Taylor|Maxwell Taylor]] and [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] recommended that U.S. troops be sent to South Vietnam disguised as flood relief workers. Kennedy rejected the idea but increased military assistance yet again. In April 1962, [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] warned Kennedy of the "danger we shall replace the French as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did."<ref>John Kenneth Galbraith. "Memorandum to President Kennedy from John Kenneth Galbraith on Vietnam, 4 April 1962." ''The Pentagon Papers.'' Gravel. ed. Boston, Massachusetts Beacon Press, 1971, vol. 2. pp. 669–671.</ref> By November 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was initiated in late 1961. This joint U.S.-South Vietnamese program attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified camps. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. However, by November 1963 the program had waned, and it officially ended in 1964.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=1070}}

On 23 July 1962, fourteen nations, including China, South Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Vietnam and the United States, signed an agreement promising to respect the neutrality of Laos.<ref name=laos35k>[http://www.answers.com/topic/international-agreement-on-the-neutrality-of-laos-35k International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos].</ref>

===Ousting and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm===

The inept performance of the South Vietnamese army was exemplified by failed actions such as the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] on 2 January 1963, in which a small band of Viet Cong won a battle against a much larger and better-equipped South Vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sheehan|1989|pp=201–66}}.</ref> As historian [[James Gibson (historian)|James Gibson]] summed up the situation:
{{quote|Strategic hamlets had failed…. The South Vietnamese regime was incapable of winning the peasantry because of its class base among landlords. Indeed, there was no longer a 'regime' in the sense of a relatively stable political alliance and functioning bureaucracy. Instead, civil government and military operations had virtually ceased. The National Liberation Front had made great progress and was close to declaring provisional revolutionary governments in large areas.<ref>James Gibson, ''The Perfect War: Technowar in Vietnam'' (Boston/New York: The Atlantic Monthly Press, 1986), p. 88.</ref>}}

[[File:ACAV and M48 Convoy Vietnam War.jpg|thumb|left|A US tank convoy during the Vietnam War.]]
The ARVN were led in that battle by Diệm's most trusted general, [[Huỳnh Văn Cao]], commander of the [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]]. Cao was a Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups; he had earlier vomited during a communist attack. Some policymakers in Washington began to conclude that Diệm was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh. He seemed concerned only with fending off coups, and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F. Kennedy]] noted, "Diệm wouldn't make even the slightest concessions. He was difficult to reason with…"<ref>Live interview by John Bartlow Martin. ''Was Kennedy Planning to Pull out of Vietnam?'' New York City. John F. Kennedy Library, 1964, Tape V, Reel 1.</ref>

Discontent with Diệm's policies exploded following the [[Huế Phật Đản shootings]] of nine majority Buddhists who were protesting against the ban on the [[Buddhist flag]] on [[Vesak]], the Buddha's birthday. This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents. Diệm's elder brother [[Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục|Ngô Đình Thục]] was the Archbishop of Huế and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state. Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Diệm's rule. Diệm refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|ARVN Special Forces]] of Colonel [[Lê Quang Tung]], loyal to Diệm's younger brother [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], [[Xá Lợi Pagoda raids|raided pagodas across Vietnam]], causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.

[[File:Diem dead.jpg|thumb|[[Ngô Đình Diệm]] after being shot and killed in the 1963 coup.]]

U.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a regime change during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favored Diệm. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Diệm's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ngô family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was in contact with generals planning to remove Diệm. They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid. President Diệm was overthrown and executed, along with his brother, on 2 November 1963. When he was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that Kennedy "rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face."<ref name = "Karnow 1997 326">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=326}}.</ref> He had not approved Diệm's murder. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], invited the coup leaders to the embassy and congratulated them. Ambassador Lodge informed Kennedy that "the prospects now are for a shorter war".<ref name = "Karnow 1997 327">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=327}}.</ref>

Following the coup, chaos ensued. Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in quick succession. Increasingly, each new regime was viewed by the communists as a puppet of the Americans; whatever the failings of Diệm, his credentials as a nationalist (as Robert McNamara later reflected) had been impeccable.<ref name = "McNamara 1999 328">{{Harvnb|McNamara|1999|p=328}}.</ref>

U.S military advisors were embedded at every level of the South Vietnamese armed forces.

[[Lyndon B. Johnson]], as he took over the presidency after the [[John F.

After several attacks upon them, it was decided that [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] bases needed more protection as the South Vietnamese military seemed incapable of providing security. On 8 March 1965, 3,500 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were dispatched to South Vietnam. This marked the beginning of the American ground war.

* Phase 1. Commitment of U.S. (and other free world) forces necessary to halt the losing trend by the end of 1965.
* Phase 2. U.S. and allied forces mount major offensive actions to seize the initiative to destroy guerrilla and organized enemy forces. This phase would end when the enemy had been worn down, thrown on the defensive, and driven back from major populated areas.
* Phase 3. If the enemy persisted, a period of twelve to eighteen months following Phase 2 would be required for the final destruction of enemy forces remaining in remote base areas.<ref>U.S. Department of Defense, ''U.S.-Vietnam Relations'' vol. 5, pp. 8–9.</ref>

The plan was approved by Johnson and marked a profound departure from the previous administration's insistence that the government of South Vietnam was responsible for defeating the guerrillas.

Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam began to stabilize with the coming to power of prime minister Air Marshal [[Nguyen Cao Ky]] and figurehead Chief of State, General [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]], in mid-1965 at the head of a military junta. This ended a series of coups that had happened more than once a year. In 1967, Thieu became president with Ky as his deputy, after rigged elections. Although they were nominally a civilian government, Ky was supposed to maintain real power through a behind-the-scenes military body. However, Thieu outmaneuvered and sidelined Ky by filling the ranks with generals from his faction. Thieu was also accused of murdering Ky loyalists through contrived military accidents. Thieu, mistrustful and indecisive, remained president until 1975, having won a one-candidate election in 1971.<ref name = "Karnow 1997 706">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=706}}.</ref>

===Tet Offensive===
{{Main|Tet Offensive}}
[[File:Sgt. Ronald H. Payne Tunnel Rat Vietnam War 1967.jpg|thumb|right|A US "[[tunnel rat]]" soldier prepares to enter a Viet Cong tunnel.]]
In late 1967 the Communists lured American forces into the hinterlands at [[Đắk Tô]] and at the [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Marine Khe Sanh combat base]] in [[Quảng Trị Province]] where the United States was more than willing to fight because it could unleash its massive firepower unimpeded by civilians. However, on 31 January 1968, the NVA and the Viet Cong broke the truce that traditionally accompanied the [[Tết]] (Lunar New Year) holiday by launching the largest battle of the war, the Tet Offensive, in the hope of sparking a national uprising. Over 100 cities were attacked by over 85,000 enemy troops including assaults on General Westmoreland's headquarters and the [[United States Embassy, Saigon|U.S. Embassy in Saigon]].<ref name = "McNamara 1999 363_365">{{Harvnb|McNamara|1999|pp=363–5}}.</ref>

Although the U.S. and South Vietnamese forces were initially shocked by the scale of the urban offensive, they responded quickly and effectively, decimating the ranks of the Viet Cong. In the former capital city of [[Huế]], the combined NVA and Viet Cong troops captured the Imperial Citadel and much of the city and [[Massacre at Huế|massacred over 3,000 unarmed Huế]] civilians.<ref>Stephen T. Hosmer (1970), ''Viet Cong Repression and its Implications for the Future'' (Rand Corporation), pp.72–8.</ref> In the following [[Battle of Huế]] American forces employed massive firepower that left 80 percent of the city in ruins.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kolko|1985|pp=308–9}}.</ref> Further north, at Quảng Trị City, members of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] and 1st ARVN Infantry Division killed more than 600 NVA and Viet Cong troops in and around the city. In Saigon, 1,000 NLF fighters fought off 11,000 U.S. and ARVN troops for three weeks.

Across South Vietnam, 4,100 Americans and other allied troops, 4,900 ARVN, 14,000 civilians, and 20,000 NVA and Viet Cong lay dead.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

But the Tet Offensive had another, unintended consequence. General Westmoreland had become the public face of the war. He was featured on the cover of ''Time'' magazine three times and was named 1965's Man of the Year.<ref name="Time">"The Guardians at the Gate", ''Time'' 7 January 1966, vol. 87, no.1.</ref> ''Time'' described him as "the sinewy personification of the American fighting man… (who) directed the historic buildup, drew up the battle plans, and infused the… men under him with his own idealistic view of U.S. aims and responsibilities."<ref name="Time"/> Six weeks after the Tet Offensive began, "public approval of his overall performance dropped from 48 percent to 36 percent–and, more dramatically, endorsement for his handling of the war fell from 40 percent to 26 percent."<ref>Stanley Karnow, Vietnam: A History (New York: Penguin, 1986), p. 546</ref>

[[File:Hue1968.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines fighting in Huế]]

In November 1967 Westmoreland spearheaded a public relations drive for the Johnson administration to bolster flagging public support.<ref name="Witz">Witz ''The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War'' pp. 1–2.</ref> In a speech before the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] he said a point in the war had been reached "where the end comes into view."<ref>Larry Berman. ''Lyndon Johnson's War.'' New York, W.W. Norton, 1991, p. 116.</ref> Thus, the public was shocked and confused when Westmoreland's predictions were trumped by Tet.<ref name="Witz"/> The American media, which had until then been largely supportive of U.S. efforts, turned on the Johnson administration for what had become an increasing credibility gap.

Although the Tet Offensive was a significant victory for allied forces, in terms of casualties and control of territory, it was a sound defeat when evaluated from the point of view of strategic consequences: it became a turning point in America's involvement in the Vietnam War because it had a profound impact on domestic support for the conflict. Despite the military failure for the Communist forces, the Tet Offensive became a political victory for them and ended the career of president Lyndon B. Johnson, who declined to run for re-election as his approval rating slumped from 48 to 36 percent.<ref name="Witz"/> As James Witz noted, Tet "contradicted the claims of progress… made by the Johnson administration and the military."<ref name="Witz"/> The offensive constituted an [[Failure in the intelligence cycle|intelligence failure]] on the scale of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].<ref name = "Karnow 1997 556" /><ref>Harold P.

Westmoreland became Chief of Staff of the Army in March 1968, just as all resistance was finally subdued. The move was technically a promotion. However, his position had become untenable because of the offensive and because his request for 200,000 additional troops had been leaked to the media. Westmoreland was succeeded by his deputy [[Creighton Abrams]], a commander less inclined to public media pronouncements.<ref>Sorely 1999, pp. 11–16.</ref>

On 10 May 1968, despite low expectations, [[Paris Peace Accords|peace talks]] began between the United States and North Vietnam in Paris. Negotiations stagnated for five months, until Johnson gave orders to halt the bombing of North Vietnam.

As historian [[Robert Dallek]] writes, "Lyndon Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam divided Americans into warring camps… cost 30,000 American lives by the time he left office, (and) destroyed Johnson's presidency…"<ref>Gerdes (ed.)

Vietnam was a major political issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1968|United States presidential election in 1968]]. The election was won by Republican party candidate [[Richard Nixon]].

==Vietnamization, 1969–72==

===Nixon Doctrine / Vietnamization===
[[File:Vietnampropaganda.png|thumb|Propaganda leaflet urging the defection of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese to the side of the Republic of Vietnam]]
Severe communist losses during the Tet Offensive allowed U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] to begin troop withdrawals. His plan, called the [[Nixon Doctrine]], was to build up the ARVN, so that they could take over the defense of South Vietnam. The policy became known as "[[Vietnamization]]". Vietnamization had much in common with the policies of the Kennedy administration. One important difference, however, remained. While Kennedy insisted that the South Vietnamese fight the war themselves, he attempted to limit the scope of the conflict.

Nixon said in an announcement, "I am tonight announcing plans for the withdrawal of an additional 150,000 American troops to be completed during the spring of next year. This will bring a total reduction of 265,500 men in our armed forces in Vietnam below the level that existed when we took office 15 months ago."<ref name=upi1970>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title |title=Vietnamization: 1970 Year in Review |publisher=Upi.com |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>

On 10 October 1969, Nixon ordered a squadron of 18 [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] loaded with nuclear weapons [[Operation Giant Lance|to race to the border of Soviet airspace]] to convince the Soviet Union, in accord with the [[madman theory]], that he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War.

Nixon also pursued negotiations. Theater commander [[Creighton Abrams]] shifted to smaller operations, aimed at communist logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN. Nixon also began to pursue [[détente]] with the Soviet Union and [[Sino-American relations#Rapprochement|rapprochement with China]]. This policy helped to decrease global tensions. Détente led to nuclear arms reduction on the part of both superpowers. But Nixon was disappointed that China and the Soviet Union continued to supply the North Vietnamese with aid. In September 1969, Ho Chi Minh died at age seventy-nine.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Ho Chi Minh Dies of Heart Attack in Hanoi |work=The Times |page =1 |date =4 September 1969}}</ref>

The anti-war movement was gaining strength in the United States. Nixon appealed to the "[[silent majority]]" of Americans who he said supported the war without showing it in public. But revelations of the [[My Lai Massacre]], in which a U.S. Army [[My Lai Massacre#1st Platoon|platoon]] raped and killed civilians, and the 1969 "[[Green Beret Affair]]" where eight Special Forces soldiers, including the 5th Special Forces Group Commander, were arrested for the murder<ref>Jeff Stein, Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy Story that Changed the Course of the Vietnam War. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992) 60–62.</ref> of a suspected double agent<ref>Seals, Bob (2007) [http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thCentury/articles/greenberets.aspx The "Green Beret Affair": A Brief Introduction].</ref> provoked national and international outrage.

Beginning in 1970, American troops were withdrawn from border areas where most of the fighting took place, and instead redeployed along the coast and interior, which is one reason why casualties in 1970 were less than half of 1969's totals.<ref name=upi1970 />

===Cambodia and Laos===
{{Main|Operation Menu|Operation Freedom Deal|Operation Commando Hunt|Laotian Civil War|Cambodian Civil War|Operation Lam Son 719}}
Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] had proclaimed Cambodia neutral since 1955,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sihanouk | first1 = Prince Norodom | year = | title = Cambodia Neutral: The Dictates of Necessity | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 1958 | issue = | pages = 582–583 }}</ref> but the communists used Cambodian soil as a base and Sihanouk tolerated their presence, because he wished to avoid being drawn into a wider regional conflict. Under pressure from Washington, however, he changed this policy in 1969. The Vietnamese communists were no longer welcome. President Nixon took the opportunity to launch a massive bombing campaign, called Operation Menu, against communist sanctuaries along the Cambodia/Vietnam border. Only five high-ranking Congressional officials were informed of Operation Menu.<ref>They were: Senators John C. Stennis (MS) and Richard B. Russell Jr. (GA) and Representatives Lucius Mendel Rivers (SC), Gerald R. Ford (MI), and Leslie C. Arends (IL). Arends and Ford were leaders of the Republican minority and the other three were Democrats on either the Armed Services or Appropriations committees.</ref>

In 1970, Prince [[Cambodian coup of 1970|Sihanouk was deposed]] by his pro-American prime minister [[Lon Nol]]. North Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1970 at the request of [[Khmer Rouge]] deputy leader [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, "The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives", in Susan E. Cook, ed., ''Genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda'' (Yale Genocide Studies Program Monograph Series No. 1, 2004), p. 54 ff. Available online at: www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/Mosyakov.doc "In April–May 1970, many North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea. Nguyen Co Thach recalls: "Nuon Chea has asked for help and we have liberated five provinces of Cambodia in ten days."</ref> U.S. and ARVN forces launched [[Cambodian Campaign|an invasion into Cambodia]] to attack NVA and Viet Cong bases.

This invasion sparked [[protests against the Vietnam War|nationwide U.S. protests]] as Nixon had promised to deescalate the American involvement. [[Kent State shootings|Four students were killed by National Guardsmen]] at [[Kent State University]] during a protest in [[Ohio]], which provoked further public outrage in the United States. The reaction to the incident by the Nixon administration was seen as callous and indifferent, providing additional impetus for the anti-war movement.<ref>Joe Angio. ''Nixon a Presidency Revealed.'' Television Documentary, The History Channel, 15 February 2007.</ref> The U.S. Air Force continued to heavily bomb Cambodia in support of the Cambodian government as part of [[Operation Freedom Deal]].

In 1971 the [[Pentagon Papers]] were leaked to ''[[The New York Times]]''. The top-secret history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, commissioned by the Department of Defense, detailed a long series of public deceptions on the part of the U.S. government. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that its publication was legal.<ref name="eJournal.USA">{{Cite journal|last=[[USA.gov]]|date=February 1997|title=The Pentagon Papers Case|journal= EJournal USA|volume= 2|issue= 1 |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0297/ijde/goodsb1.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080112095748/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0297/ijde/goodsb1.htm |archivedate=12 January 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |ref=harv}}</ref>
[[File:M41-walker-bulldog-tank.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[M41 Walker Bulldog]], the main battle tank of the ARVN]]
The ARVN launched [[Operation Lam Son 719]] in February 1971, aimed at cutting the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos.<ref name=laos35k /> The ostensibly neutral Laos had long been the scene of a civil war, pitting the [[Kingdom of Laos|Laotian government]] backed by the US against the [[Pathet Lao]] and its North Vietnamese allies. After meeting resistance, ARVN forces retreated in a confused rout. They fled along roads littered with their own dead. When they exhausted fuel supplies, soldiers abandoned their vehicles and attempted to barge their way on to American helicopters sent to evacuate the wounded. Many ARVN soldiers clung to helicopter skids in a desperate attempt to save themselves. U.S. aircraft had to destroy abandoned equipment, including tanks, to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Half of the ARVN troops involved in the operation were either captured or killed. The operation was a fiasco and represented a clear failure of Vietnamization. As Karnow noted "the blunders were monumental… The (South Vietnamese) government's top officers had been tutored by the Americans for ten or fifteen years, many at training schools in the United States, yet they had learned little."<ref name="Karnow 1997 644_645">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|pp=644–5}}.</ref>

In 1971 Australia and New Zealand withdrew their soldiers. The U.S. troop count was further reduced to 196,700, with a deadline to remove another 45,000 troops by February 1972. As [[protests against the Vietnam War|peace protests]] spread across the United States, disillusionment and ill-discipline grew in the ranks<ref>{{Cite book

Vietnamization was again tested by the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972, a massive conventional NVA invasion of South Vietnam. The NVA and Viet Cong quickly overran the northern provinces and in coordination with other forces attacked from Cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half. U.S. troop withdrawals continued. But American airpower came to the rescue with [[Operation Linebacker]], and the offensive was halted. However, it became clear that without American airpower South Vietnam could not survive. The last remaining American ground troops were withdrawn by the end of March 1973; U.S. naval and air forces remained in the Gulf of Tonkin, as well as Thailand and Guam.<ref>G. Herring, ''America's Longest War'' (2nd ed., 1986), p.260.</ref>

===1972 election and Paris Peace Accords===
The war was the central issue of the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 U.S. presidential election]]. Nixon's opponent, [[George McGovern]], campaigned on a platform of withdrawal from Vietnam. Nixon's National Security Advisor, [[Henry Kissinger]], continued secret negotiations with North Vietnam's [[Lê Đức Thọ]]. In October 1972, they reached an agreement.
[[File:B-52D(061127-F-1234S-017).jpg|thumb|left|[[Operation Linebacker II]], December 1972]]

However, South Vietnamese president Thieu demanded massive changes to the peace accord. When North Vietnam went public with the agreement's details, the Nixon administration claimed that the North was attempting to embarrass the president. The negotiations became deadlocked. Hanoi demanded new changes.

To show his support for South Vietnam and force Hanoi back to the negotiating table, Nixon ordered [[Operation Linebacker II]], a massive bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong 18–29 December 1972. The offensive destroyed much of the remaining economic and industrial capacity of North Vietnam. Simultaneously Nixon pressured Thieu to accept the terms of the agreement, threatening to conclude a bilateral peace deal and cut off American aid.

On 15 January 1973, Nixon announced the suspension of offensive action against North Vietnam. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] on "Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam" were signed on 27 January 1973, officially ending direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. A cease-fire was declared across North and South Vietnam. U.S. prisoners of war were released. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces. "This article", noted Peter Church, "proved… to be the only one of the Paris Agreements which was fully carried out."<ref>Peter Church, ed. ''A Short History of South-East Asia.'' Singapore. John Wiley & Sons, 2006, pp. 193–194.</ref>

==Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War: 1962–1973==
{{Main|Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War}}
[[File:Vietnam War protest in Washington DC April 1971.jpg|thumb|Protests against the war in Washington, D.C. on 24 April 1971]]
[[File:vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|Anti-Vietnam War demonstration, 1967.]]

During the course of the Vietnam War a large segment of the American population came to be opposed to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967 and by 1970 only a third of Americans believed that the U.S. had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in Vietnam.<ref>Lunch, W. & Sperlich, P. (1979). The Western Political Quarterly. 32(1). pp. 21–44</ref>

Nearly a third of the American population were strongly against the war. It is possible to specify certain groups who led the anti-war movement and the reasons why. Many young people protested because they were the ones being [[military draft|drafted]] while others were against the war because the anti-war movement grew increasingly popular among the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and drug culture in American society and its music.

Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a [[unilateral]] withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. One reason given for the withdrawal is that it would contribute to a lessening of tensions in the region and thus less human bloodshed. Early opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam drew its inspiration from the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference of 1954]]. American support of Diệm in refusing elections was seen as thwarting the very democracy that America claimed to be supporting. John F. Kennedy, while Senator, opposed involvement in Vietnam.<ref name="USvietAnalysis"/>

Opposition to the Vietnam War tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism and [[imperialism]]<ref>Louis B. Zimmer, ''The Vietnam War Debate''; pp. 54–55; Hardcover: 430 pages; Publisher: Lexington Books (13 October 2011); ISBN 0739137697.</ref> and, for those involved with the [[New Left]] such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]. Others, such as [[Stephen Spiro]] opposed the war based on the theory of [[Just War]]. Some wanted to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam, such as [[Norman Morrison]] emulating the actions of [[Thích Quảng Đức]]. In a key televised debate from 15 May 1965, Eric Severeid reporting for CBS conducted a debate between [[McGeorge Bundy]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]] dealing with an acute summary of the main war concerns of the U.S. as seen at that time stating them as: "(1) What are the justifications for the American presence in Vietnam – why are we there? (2) What is the fundamental nature of this war? Is it aggression from North Vietnam or is it basically, a civil war between the peoples of South Vietnam? (3) What are the implications of this Vietnam struggle in terms of Communist China's power and aims and future actions? And (4) What are the alternatives to our present policy in Vietnam?"<ref>Louis B. Zimmer, ''The Vietnam War Debate''; pp. 53–54; Hardcover: 430 pages; Publisher: Lexington Books (13 October 2011); ISBN 0739137697.</ref><ref>Videorecording of entire debate proceedings available at the ''Museum of Radio and Television'' in New York City.</ref>

High-profile opposition to the Vietnam War turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion. On 15 October 1969, the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium]] attracted millions of Americans.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/15/newsid_2533000/2533131.stm 1969: Millions march in US Vietnam Moratorium].

==Exit of the Americans: 1973–75==
[[File:Vietnam War protesters.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-war protests]]
The United States began drastically reducing their troop support in South Vietnam during the final years of [[Vietnamization]]. Many U.S. troops were removed from the region, and on 5 March 1971, the United States returned the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]], which was the first American unit deployed to [[South Vietnam]], to its former base in [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].<ref name="Stanton p. 240">{{harvnb|Stanton|2003|p=240}}</ref> {{#tag:ref|On 8 March 1965 the first American combat troops the, [[3rd Marine Division (United States)#Vietnam War|Third Marine Regiment, Third Marine Division]], began landing in Vietnam to protect the [[Da Nang International Airport|Da Nang airport]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Willbanks|2009| p =110}}</ref><ref name="nps.gov">{{cite web|ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://www.nps.gov/mrc/reader/vvmcr.htm|title = Facts about the Vietnam Veterans memorial collection| publisher = [[National Park Service|NPS.gov]]| accessdate =26 April 2010}}</ref> |group="A"}}

Under the [[Paris Peace Accords]], between North Vietnamese Foreign Minister [[Lê Đức Thọ]] and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and reluctantly signed by South Vietnamese president [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu|Thiệu]], U.S. military forces withdrew from South Vietnam and prisoners were exchanged. North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying communist troops in the South, but only to the extent of replacing expended materiel. Later that year the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to Kissinger and Thọ, but the Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying that a true peace did not yet exist.

The communist leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favor their side. But Saigon, bolstered by a surge of U.S. aid received just before the ceasefire went into effect, began to roll back the Viet Cong. The communists responded with a new strategy hammered out in a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Trần Văn Trà]].<ref name = "Karnow 1997 672_674">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|pp=672–4}}.</ref>

As the Viet Cong's top commander, Tra participated in several of these meetings. With U.S. bombings suspended, work on the Ho Chi Minh trail and other logistical structures could proceed unimpeded. Logistics would be upgraded until the North was in a position to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for the 1975–76 dry season. Tra calculated that this date would be Hanoi's last opportunity to strike before Saigon's army could be fully trained.<ref name = "Karnow 1997 672_674"/>

In the November 1972 Election, Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]] lost 49 of 50 states to the incumbent President [[Richard Nixon]]. On 15 March 1973, President Nixon implied that the United States would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public and congressional reaction to Nixon's trial balloon was unfavorable and in April Nixon appointed [[Graham Martin]] as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. Martin was a second stringer compared to previous U.S. ambassadors and his appointment was an early signal that Washington had given up on Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} During his confirmation hearings in June 1973, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[James R. Schlesinger]] stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. On 4 June 1973, the U.S. Senate passed the [[Case–Church Amendment]] to prohibit such intervention.<ref name = "Karnow 1997 670_672">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|pp=670–2}}.</ref>

The [[1973 oil crisis|oil price shock of October 1973]] following the [[Yom Kippur War]] in Egypt caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. The Viet Cong resumed offensive operations when the dry season began and by January 1974 it had recaptured the territory it lost during the previous dry season. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thieu announced on 4 January that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There had been over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/thieu-announces-war-has-resumed |title=This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed |publisher=History.com |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>

[[Gerald Ford]] took over as U.S. president on 9 August 1974 after president Nixon resigned due to the [[Watergate scandal]]. At this time, Congress cut financial aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion a year to $700 million. The U.S. midterm elections in 1974 brought in a new Congress dominated by Democrats who were even more determined to confront the president on the war. Congress immediately voted in restrictions on funding and military activities to be phased in through 1975 and to culminate in a total cutoff of funding in 1976.

The success of the 1973–74 dry season offensive inspired Trà to return to Hanoi in October 1974 and plead for a larger offensive in the next dry season. This time, Trà could travel on a drivable highway with regular fueling stops, a vast change from the days when the Ho Chi Minh trail was a dangerous mountain trek.<ref name = "Karnow 1997 676">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=676}}.</ref> Giáp, the North Vietnamese defense minister, was reluctant to approve Trà's plan. A larger offensive might provoke a U.S. reaction and interfere with the big push planned for 1976. Trà appealed over Giáp's head to first secretary [[Lê Duẩn]], who approved of the operation.

Trà's plan called for a limited offensive from Cambodia into [[Phước Long Province]]. The strike was designed to solve local logistical problems, gauge the reaction of South Vietnamese forces, and determine whether U.S. would return to the fray.
[[File:Hanoi-taxi-march1973.jpg|thumb|Recently released American POWs from North Vietnamese prison camps, 1973]]
On 13 December 1974, North Vietnamese forces [[Battle of Phuoc Long|attacked Route 14 in Phước Long Province]]. Phuoc Binh, the provincial capital, fell on 6 January 1975. Ford desperately asked Congress for funds to assist and re-supply the South before it was overrun. Congress refused. The fall of Phuoc Binh and the lack of an American response left the South Vietnamese elite demoralized.

The speed of this success led the Politburo to reassess its strategy. It was decided that operations in the Central Highlands would be turned over to General [[Văn Tiến Dũng]] and that Pleiku should be seized, if possible. Before he left for the South, Dũng was addressed by Lê Duẩn: "Never have we had military and political conditions so perfect or a strategic advantage as great as we have now."<ref>Clark Dougan, David Fulgham et al., ''The Fall of the South.'' Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1985, p. 22.</ref>

At the start of 1975, the South Vietnamese had three times as much artillery and twice the number of tanks and armored cars as the opposition. They also had 1,400 aircraft and a two-to-one numerical superiority in combat troops over their Communist enemies.<ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/kolko04292005.html The End of the Vietnam War, 30 Years Ago] by [[Gabriel Kolko]], [[CounterPunch]] 30 April / 1 May 2005.</ref> However, the rising oil prices meant that much of this could not be used. They faced a well-organized, highly determined and well-funded North Vietnam. Much of the North's material and financial support came from the communist bloc. Within South Vietnam, there was increasing chaos. Their abandonment by the American military had compromised an economy dependent on U.S. financial support and the presence of a large number of U.S. troops. South Vietnam suffered from the global recession that followed the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]].

===Campaign 275===
{{see also|1975 Spring Offensive|Battle of Ban Me Thuot|Hue–Da Nang Campaign}}
[[File:Le musée des Souvenirs de guerre (Hô Chi Minh Ville).jpg|thumb|Captured U.S. armored vehicles]]
On 10 March 1975, General Dung launched Campaign 275, a limited offensive into the Central Highlands, supported by tanks and heavy artillery. The target was [[Battle of Buon Me Thuot|Buôn Ma Thuột]], in [[Đắk Lắk Province]]. If the town could be taken, the provincial capital of [[Pleiku]] and the road to the coast would be exposed for a planned campaign in 1976. The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught, and its forces collapsed on 11 March. Once again, Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success. Dung now urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and then turn his attention to [[Kon Tum]]. He argued that with two months of good weather remaining until the onset of the monsoon, it would be irresponsible to not take advantage of the situation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

President [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]], a former general, was fearful that his forces would be cut off in the north by the attacking communists; Thieu ordered a retreat. The president declared this to be a "lighten the top and keep the bottom" strategy. But in what appeared to be a repeat of [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the withdrawal soon turned into a bloody rout. While the bulk of ARVN forces attempted to flee, isolated units fought desperately. ARVN General Phu abandoned Pleiku and Kon Tum and retreated toward the coast, in what became known as the "column of tears".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

As the ARVN tried to disengage from the enemy, refugees mixed in with the line of retreat. The poor condition of roads and bridges, damaged by years of conflict and neglect, slowed Phu's column. As the North Vietnamese forces approached, panic set in. Often abandoned by the officers, the soldiers and civilians were shelled incessantly. The retreat degenerated into a desperate scramble for the coast. By 1 April the "column of tears" was all but annihilated.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

On 20 March, Thieu reversed himself and ordered Huế, Vietnam's third-largest city, be held at all costs, and then changed his policy several times. Thieu's contradictory orders confused and demoralized his officer corps. As the North Vietnamese launched their attack, panic set in, and ARVN resistance withered. On 22 March, the NVA opened the siege of Huế. Civilians flooded the airport and the docks hoping for any mode of escape. Some even swam out to sea to reach boats and barges anchored offshore. In the confusion, routed ARVN soldiers fired on civilians to make way for their retreat.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

On 25 March, after a three-day battle, Huế fell. As resistance in Huế collapsed, North Vietnamese rockets rained down on [[Hue-Da Nang Campaign|Da Nang]] and its airport. By 28 March 35,000 VPA troops were poised to attack the suburbs. By 30 March 100,000 leaderless ARVN troops surrendered as the NVA marched victoriously through Da Nang. With the fall of the city, the defense of the Central Highlands and Northern provinces came to an end.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Final North Vietnamese offensive===
[[File:Khu trưng bày máy bay.JPG|thumb|Captured [[USAF]] warplanes in [[North Vietnam]] Museum]]
{{details|Ho Chi Minh Campaign|the final North Vietnamese offensive}}
With the northern half of the country under their control, the Politburo ordered General Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon. The operational plan for the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]] called for the capture of Saigon before 1 May. Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent any redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital. Northern forces, their morale boosted by their recent victories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh, and Da Lat.

On 7 April, three North Vietnamese divisions attacked [[Battle of Xuân Lộc|Xuân Lộc]], 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) east of Saigon. The North Vietnamese met fierce resistance at Xuân Lộc from the [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|ARVN 18th Division]], who were outnumbered six to one. For two bloody weeks, severe fighting raged as the ARVN defenders made a [[last stand]] to try to block the North Vietnamese advance. By 21 April, however, the exhausted garrison were ordered to withdraw towards Saigon.

An embittered and tearful president Thieu resigned on the same day, declaring that the United States had betrayed South Vietnam. In a scathing attack, he suggested U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had tricked him into signing the Paris peace agreement two years ago, promising military aid that failed to materialize. Having transferred power to [[Trần Văn Hương]], he left for [[Taiwan]] on 25 April. At the same time, North Vietnamese tanks had reached [[Biên Hòa]] and turned toward Saigon, brushing aside isolated ARVN units along the way.

By the end of April, the ARVN had collapsed on all fronts except in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Thousands of refugees streamed southward, ahead of the main communist onslaught. On 27 April 100,000 North Vietnamese troops encircled Saigon. The city was defended by about 30,000 ARVN troops. To hasten a collapse and foment panic, the NVA shelled the airport and forced its closure. With the air exit closed, large numbers of civilians found that they had no way out.

===Fall of Saigon===
[[File:NVA pose for picture in Presidential Palace at end of Vietnam war.jpg|thumb|upright|Victorious NVA troops at the Presidential Palace, Saigon.]]
{{Main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}
Chaos, unrest, and panic broke out as hysterical South Vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave Saigon. [[Martial law]] was declared. American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese, U.S., and foreign nationals from various parts of the city and from the U.S. embassy compound. [[Operation Frequent Wind]] had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of U.S. Ambassador [[Graham Martin]]'s belief that Saigon could be held and that a political settlement could be reached.

Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] by helicopter of the last U.S. diplomatic, military, and civilian personnel. Frequent Wind was arguably the largest helicopter evacuation in history. It began on 29 April, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited space. Martin pleaded with Washington to dispatch $700 million in emergency aid to bolster the regime and help it mobilize fresh military reserves. But American public opinion had soured on this conflict.

In the United States, South Vietnam was perceived as doomed. President [[Gerald Ford]] had given a televised speech on 23 April, declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all U.S. aid. Frequent Wind continued around the clock, as North Vietnamese tanks breached defenses on the outskirts of Saigon. In the early morning hours of 30 April, the last U.S. Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds. Many of them had been employed by the Americans and were left to their fate.

On 30 April 1975, NVA troops entered the city of Saigon and quickly overcame all resistance, capturing key buildings and installations. A tank from the 324th Division crashed through the gates of the [[Independence Palace]] at 11:30&nbsp;am local time and the Viet Cong flag was raised above it. President [[Dương Văn Minh]], who had succeeded Huong two days earlier, surrendered.<ref name = "Tucker 1999 29">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1999|p=[http://books.google.com/?id=WZry2NaH2_sC&pg=PA29 29]}}</ref>

==Other countries' involvement==

===Pro-Hanoi===

====People's Republic of China====
In 1950, the People's Republic of China extended [[diplomatic recognition]] to the [[Viet Minh]]'s [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and sent weapons, as well as military advisors led by [[Politics of Shanxi#List of Governors of Shanxi|Luo Guibo]] to assist the Viet Minh in its [[First Indochina War|war with the French]]. The first draft of the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]] was negotiated by French prime minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] and Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] who, fearing U.S. intervention, urged the Viet Minh to accept a partition at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]].<ref>Qiang Zhai, ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950–1975'', University of North Carolina Press, pp. 54–55.</ref>

In the summer of 1962, [[Mao Zedong]] agreed to supply Hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. Starting in 1965, China sent [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] units and engineering [[battalion]]s to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing, rebuild roads and railroads, and to perform other engineering works. This freed North Vietnamese army units for combat in the South. China sent 320,000 troops and annual arms shipments worth $180 million.<ref>Qiang Zhai (2000), ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950–1975'', University of North Carolina Press, p.135</ref>

[[Sino-Soviet relations]] soured after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968. In October, the Chinese demanded North Vietnam cut relations with Moscow, but Hanoi refused.<ref>Ang, Cheng Guan, ''Ending the Vietnam War: The Vietnamese Communists' Perspective'', p. 27.</ref> The Chinese began to withdraw in November 1968 in preparation for a clash with the Soviets, which occurred at [[Zhenbao Island]] in March 1969. The Chinese also began financing the [[Khmer Rouge]] as a counterweight to the Vietnamese communists at this time.

China "armed and trained" the Khmer Rouge during the civil war and continued to aid them for years afterward.<ref>Bezlova, Antoaneta, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KB21Ad01.html China haunted by Khmer Rouge links], ''Asia Times'', 21 February 2009.</ref>
The Khmer Rouge launched ferocious raids into Vietnam in 1975–1978. When Vietnam responded with an invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge, China launched a brief, punitive [[Sino-Vietnamese War|invasion of Vietnam in 1979]].

====Soviet Union====
[[File:Leonid Brežněv (Bundesarchiv).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonid Brezhnev]] was the [[leader of the Soviet Union]] during the second half of the Vietnam War]]
Soviet ships in the South China Sea gave vital early warnings to [[Viet Cong]] forces in South Vietnam. The Soviet intelligence ships would pick up American [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers flying from [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and [[Guam]]. Their airspeed and direction would be noted and then relayed to [[COSVN]] headquarters. COSVN using airspeed and direction would calculate the bombing target and tell any assets to move "perpendicularly to the attack trajectory." These advance warning gave them time to move out of the way of the bombers, and, while the bombing runs caused extensive damage, because of the early warnings from 1968 to 1970 they did not kill a single military or civilian leader in the headquarters complexes.<ref name="Truong p. 168">{{harvnb|Truong|1985|p=168}}</ref>

The Soviet Union supplied North Vietnam with medical supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment. Soviet crews fired Soviet-made [[surface-to-air missile]]s at U.S. [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]], which were shot down over Thanh Hóa in 1965. Over a dozen Soviet citizens lost their lives in this conflict. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian officials acknowledged that the Soviet Union had stationed up to 3,000 troops in Vietnam during the war.<ref name="historicaltextarchive.com.Soviet">{{Cite news|ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=180|title = Soviet Involvement in the Vietnam War| agency = Associated Press |publisher = historicaltextarchive.com| accessdate =27 March 2010|last=AP}}</ref>

Some Russian sources give more specific numbers: Between 1953 and 1991, the hardware donated by the Soviet Union included 2,000 tanks, 1,700 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]], 7,000 artillery guns, over 5,000 anti-aircraft guns, 158 surface-to-air missile launchers, 120 helicopters. During the war, the Soviets sent North Vietnam annual arms shipments worth $450 million.<ref>Oleg Sarin and Lev Dvoretsky (1996),

====North Korea====
As a result of a decision of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers' Party]] in October 1966, in early 1967 [[North Korea]] sent a fighter squadron to North Vietnam to back up the North Vietnamese 921st and 923rd fighter squadrons defending Hanoi. They stayed through 1968, and 200 pilots were reported to have served.<ref>Asia Times, 18 August 2006, Richard M Bennett [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/HH18Dg02.html Missiles and madness].</ref>

In addition, at least two anti-aircraft artillery regiments were sent as well. North Korea also sent weapons, ammunition and two million sets of uniforms to their comrades in North Vietnam.<ref>Merle Pribbenow, 'The 'Ology War: technology and ideology in the defense of Hanoi, 1967' ''Journal of Military History'' 67:1 (2003) p. 183.</ref> [[Kim Il-sung]] is reported to have told his pilots to "fight in the war as if the Vietnamese sky were their own".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1427367.stm |date= 7 July 2001 |title=N Korea admits Vietnam war role |first= Caroline |last= Gluck |work=BBC News |accessdate=19 October 2006}}; also see {{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/696970.stm |date=31 March 2000 |title=North Korea fought in Vietnam War |work=BBC News |accessdate=19 October 2006}}; also see {{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1435540.stm| date= 12 July 2001 |title=North Korea honours Vietnam war dead|publisher=BBC News| accessdate=19 October 2006}}</ref>

====Cuba====
The contributions to North Vietnam by the communist [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]], under [[Fidel Castro]], is still a matter of debate. There are numerous allegations by former U.S. [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] that Cuban military personnel were present at North Vietnamese prison facilities during the war, and that they participated in torture activities, in what is known as the "Cuba Program".<ref>[http://www.aiipowmia.com/testimony/cubanews1.html AII POW-MIA Cuban Torture].

Australia and New Zealand, close allies of the United States and members of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) and the [[ANZUS]] military co-operation treaty, sent ground troops to Vietnam. Both nations had gained experience in counterinsurgency and jungle warfare during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and World War II. Their governments subscribed to the [[Domino theory]].

==United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO)==
{{main|United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races}}

The ethnic minority peoples of south Vietnam like the Christian [[Degar|Montagnards]] (Degar),Hindu and Muslim [[Cham people|Cham]] and the Buddhist [[Khmer Krom]] banded together in the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races]] (French : Front Uni de Lutte des Races Opprimées, acronym: FULRO) to fight against the Vietnamese for autonomy or independence. FULRO fought against both the anti-Communist South Vietnamese and the Communist Viet Cong, and then FURLO proceeded to fight against the united Communist [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] after the fall of South Vietnam. FULRO was supported by China, the United States, Cambodia, and some French citizens.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

During the war, the South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem began a program to settle millions of ethnic Vietnamese Kinh on Montagnard lands in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] region. This provoked a backlash from the Montagnards. The Cambodians under both the pro-China King Sihanouk and the pro-American Lon Nol supported their fellow co-ethnic Khmer Krom in south Vietnam, following an anti- ethnic Vietnamese policy.

FULRO was formed from the amalgation of the Cham organization "Champa Liberation Front" (''Front de Liberation du Champa'' FLC) led by the Cham Muslim officer [[Les Kosem]] who served in the Royal Cambodian Army, the Khmer Krom organization "Liberation Front of Kampuchea Krom" (''Front de Liberation du Kampuchea Krom'' FLKK) led by Chau Dara, a former monk, and the Montagnard organizations "Central Highlands Liberation Front" (''Front de Liberation des Hauts Plateaux'' FLHP) led by Y Bham Enuol and BAJARAKA.

The leaders of FULRO were executed by the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot when he took power in Cambodia but FULRO insurgents proceeded to fight against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and it was not until 1992 that they finally surrendered to the United Nations in Cambodia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1971 the later U.S. presidential candidate, [[John Kerry]], testified before the [[U.S. Senate]] and stated that over 150 U.S. veterans testified during the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]] and described war crimes committed in Southeast Asia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

According to political scientist [[R.J. Rummel]], U.S. troops murdered about 6,000 Vietnamese civilians during the war.<ref name="Rummel"/> In terms of atrocities by the South Vietnamese, from 1964 to 1975, Rummel estimated 1,500 persons died during the forced relocations of 1,200,000 civilians, another 5,000 prisoners died from ill-treatment and about 30,000 suspected communists and fighters were executed by ARVN forces. 6,000 civilians died in the more extensive shellings. This totals, from a range of between 42,000 and 118,000 deaths caused by South Vietnam, excluding NLF/North Vietnamese forces killed by the ARVN in combat.<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB6.1B.GIF Rummel 1997] Lines 540, 556, 563, 566, 569, 575</ref>

[[Nick Turse]], in his 2013 book, ''Kill Anything that Moves'', argues that a relentless drive toward higher body counts, a widespread use of free-fire zones, rules of engagement where civilians who ran from soldiers or helicopters could be viewed as Viet Cong, and a widespread disdain for Vietnamese civilians led to massive civilian casualties and endemic war crimes inflicted by U.S. troops.<ref name = "Turse 2013 251">{{Harvnb|Turse|2013|p=251}}.</ref> One example cited by Turse is [[Operation Speedy Express]], an operation by the 9th Infantry Division, which was described by [[John Paul Vann]] as, in effect, "many My Lais".<ref name = "Turse 2013 251"/> In more detail,

{{Quotation| Air force captain, Brian Wilson, who carried out bomb-damage assessments in free-fire zones throughout the delta, saw the results firsthand. "It was the epitome of immorality…One of the times I counted bodies after an air strike—which always ended with two napalm bombs which would just fry everything that was left—I counted sixty-two bodies. In my report I described them as so many women between fifteen and twenty-five and so many children—usually in their mothers' arms or very close to them—and so many old people." When he later read the official tally of dead, he found that it listed them as 130 VC killed.<ref name = "Turse 2013 212">{{Harvnb|Turse|2013|p=212}}.</ref> }}

====War crimes committed by South Korean forces====

South Korean forces were also culpable of war crimes as well. One of the massacres was the [[Tây Vinh Massacre]] where [[ROK Capital Division]] of the [[South Korean Army]] killed 1,200 unarmed citizens between 12 February 1966 and 17 March 1966 in Bình An village, today Tây Vinh village, [[Tây Sơn District]] of [[Bình Định Province]] in South Vietnam.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/h21/vietnam/eng-jujoo.html |title=한겨레 21 |publisher=Hani.co.kr |date=15 February 1966 |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> Another example was the [[Gò Dài massacre]] where ROK Capital Division of the South Korean Army killed 380 civilians on 26 February 1966 in Gò Dài hamlet, in Bình An commune, [[Tây Sơn District]] (today Tây Vinh District) of [[Bình Định Province]] in South Vietnam.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

[[Viet Cong]] insurgents reportedly sliced off the genitals of village chiefs and sewed them inside their bloody mouths, cut off the tongues of helpless victims, rammed bamboo lances through one ear and out the other, slashed open the wombs of pregnant women, machine gunned children, hacked men and women to pieces with machetes, and cut off the fingers of small children who dared to get an education.<ref name="Reader's Digest"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Off With Their Hands |journal=Newsweek |date=15 May 1967}}</ref> According to a U.S. Senate report, squads were assigned monthly assassination quotas.<ref>U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, ''[http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/239/2390710003B.pdf The Human Cost of Communism in Vietnam]'' (1972), p.49.</ref> Peer De Silva, former head of the Saigon department of the CIA, wrote that from as early as 1963, Viet Cong units were using disembowelment and other methods of mutilation for psychological warfare.<ref name=desilva>{{cite book |last=De Silva |first=Peer |title=Sub Rosa: The CIA and the Uses of Intelligence |page=249 |year=1978 |publisher=Time Books |place=New York |isbn=0-8129-0745-0}}</ref>

==Women in the Vietnam War==

===American nurses===
[[File:Da Nang, South Vietnam...United States Navy nurse Lieutenant Commander Joan Brouilette checks the condition of Pfc.... - NARA - 558531.jpg|thumb|Da Nang, South Vietnam, 1968]]
During the Vietnam War, American women served on active duty doing a variety of jobs. Early in 1963, the [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army Nurse Corps]] (ANC) launched Operation Nightingale, an intensive effort to recruit nurses to serve in Vietnam. Most nurses who volunteered to serve in Vietnam came from predominantly working or middle-class families with histories of military service. The majority of these women were white Catholics and Protestants.<ref>Norman, Elizabeth M. ''[http://books.google.com/?id=esg7mGs6nQMC Women at War: the Story of Fifty Military Nurses Who Served in Vietnam]''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1990. ISBN 978-0-8122-1317-1 p. 7.</ref> Because the need for medical aid was great, many nurses underwent a concentrated four-month training program before being deployed to Vietnam in the ANC.<ref>Vuic, Kara Dixon. ''[http://books.google.com/?id=E0nypXTQ_C4C Officer, Nurse, Woman: the Army Nurse Corps in the Vietnam War]''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2010. ISBN 978-0-8018-9391-9 p. 5.</ref> Due to the shortage of staff, nurses usually worked twelve-hour shifts, six days per week and often suffered from exhaustion. [[First Lieutenant]] Sharon Lane was the only female military nurse to be killed by enemy gunfire during the war, on 8 June 1969.<ref>Norman, p. 57.</ref>

[[File:Second Lieutenant Kathleen M. Sullivan treats a Vietnamese child during Operation MED CAP, a U.S. Air Force civic... - NARA - 542331.jpg|thumb|A nurse treats a Vietnamese child, 1967]]
At the start of the Vietnam War, it was commonly thought that American women had no place in the military. Their traditional place had been in the domestic sphere, but with the war came opportunity for the expansion of gender roles. In Vietnam, women held a variety of jobs which included operating complex data processing equipment and serving as stenographers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holm|1992|p=214}}.</ref> Although a small number of women were assigned to combat zones, they were never allowed directly in the field of battle. The women who served in the military were solely volunteers. They faced a plethora of challenges, one of which was the relatively small number of female soldiers. Living in a male-dominated environment created tensions between the sexes. While this high male to female ratio was often uncomfortable for women, many men reported that having women in the field with them boosted their morale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holm|1992|p=213}}.</ref> Although this was not the women's purpose, it was one positive result of the their service. By 1973, approximately 7,500 women had served in Vietnam in the Southeast Asian theater.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holm|1992|p=206}}.</ref> In that same year, the military lifted the prohibition on women entering the armed forces.

American women serving in Vietnam were subject to societal stereotypes. Many Americans either considered females serving in Vietnam masculine for living under the army discipline, or judged them to be women of questionable moral character who enlisted for the sole purpose of seducing men.<ref>Vuic, p. 8.</ref> To address this problem, the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as "proper, professional and well protected." (26) This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the ideas of second-wave feminism that occurred during the 1960s–1970s in the United States. Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment, very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported.<ref>Norman, p. 71.</ref>

===Vietnamese women===

Unlike the American women who went to Vietnam, North Vietnamese women were enlisted and fought in the combat zone as well as providing manual labor to keep the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] open and cook for the soldiers. Some served as "[[comfort women]]" for male communist fighters. They also worked in the rice fields in North Vietnam and Viet Cong-held farming areas in South Vietnam's Mekong Delta region to provide food for their families and the war effort. Women were enlisted in both the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong guerrilla insurgent force in South Vietnam. Some women also served for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong intelligence services.

In South Vietnam, many women voluntarily served in the [[ARVN]]'s Women's Armed Force Corps (WAFC) and various other Women's corps in the military. Some, like in the WAFC, fought in combat with other soldiers. Others served as nurses and doctors in the battlefield and in military hospitals, or served in South Vietnam or America's intelligence agencies. During [[Ngô Đình Diệm|Diệm]]'s presidency, [[Madame Nhu]] was the commander of the WAFC.<ref name=Shapiro>{{cite news|last=Shapiro|first=T. Rees|title=Mme.

The war saw more than one million rural people migrate or flee the fighting in the South Vietnamese countryside to the cities, especially Saigon. Among the internal refugees were many young women who became the ubiquitous "bargirls" of wartime South Vietnam "hawking her wares – be that cigarettes, liquor, or herself" to American and allied soldiers.<ref>Gustafsson, Mai Lan "'Freedom. Money. Fun. Love': The Warlore of Vietnamese Bargirls" ''Oral History Review'', 2011, Vol. 38, No. 2, p. 308; Hunt, Richard A.

==Black servicemen in Vietnam==
[[File:Haeberlewounded.jpg|thumb|190px|A wounded African American soldier being carried away, 1968]]
The experience of African American military personnel during the Vietnam War has received significant attention. For example, the website "African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War" compiles examples of such coverage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aavw.org/served/homepage_wetoo_integrated.html|title='Fully Integrated' |work=African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War (aavw.org)|accessdate=December 2013}}</ref> as does the print and broadcast work of journalist [[Wallace Terry]].

The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of Terry's book ''Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans'' (1984), includes the following quote: "I have an intuitive feeling that the Negro serviceman have a better understanding than whites of what the war is about." – [[William Westmoreland|General William C. Westmoreland]], U.S. Army, Saigon, 1967. That book's introduction includes observations about the impact of the war on the black community in general and on black servicemen specifically. Points he makes on the latter topic include: the higher proportion of combat casualties in Vietnam among African American servicemen than among American soldiers of other races, the shift toward and different attitudes of black military careerists versus black draftees, the discrimination encountered by black servicemen "on the battlefield in decorations, promotion and duty assignments" as well as their having to endure "the racial insults, cross-burnings and Confederate flags of their white comrades" – and the experiences faced by black soldiers stateside, during the war and after America's withdrawal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terry |first=Wallace |authorlink=Wallace Terry |year=1984|title=Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans |publisher=Random House. |isbn=978-0-394-53028-4|pages = Epigraph and pages xv–xvii}}</ref> Upon the war's completion, black casualties made up 12.5% of US combat deaths, approximately equal to percentage of draft-eligible black men, though still slightly higher than the 10% who served in the military.<ref name="Appy-Working-Class War">[http://books.google.com/books?id=sEygbABXmFUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Working-Class+War:+American+Combat+Soldiers+and+Vietnam&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V2fwUvSiD437kQf-5IGgDA&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=how%20many%20black%20soldiers%20served%20and%20died&f=false Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam: American Combat]</ref> The most in depth examination of who actually fought the Vietnam War was done in a 6 April 1986 Washington Post article entitled "The Myth of the Vietnam Vet." The article stated "The man who fought in Vietnam is typically depicted as a draftee, unwilling and probably black. In fact, two-thirds of those who served during the era were volunteers, 73 percent of those who died were volunteers and 12.5 percent of those who died were black (out of an age group that comprised 13.5 percent of the male population)."

Rottman, Viet Cong Fighter, Osprey Publishing (2007) p. 20-30 ISBN 978-1-84603-126-7</ref> The ubiquitous Soviet [[AK-47]] was often regarded as the best assault rifle of the war, due to its ability to continue to function even in adverse, muddy conditions. It was not uncommon to see U.S. [[special forces]] fighting with captured AK-47s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Other weapons used by the Viet Cong included the World War II-era [[PPSh-41]] submachine gun (both Soviet and Chinese versions), the [[SKS]] carbine, the [[DShK]] heavy machine gun and the [[RPG-2|RPG-2/B-40]] grenade launcher.

[[File:Nvatransportcorps.jpg|thumb|Bicycles carried up to 400 pounds of weight and were thus effective transport vehicles.]]
While the Viet Cong had both [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious tanks]] (such as the [[PT-76]]) and [[light tank]]s (such as the [[Type 62]]), they also used bicycles to transport munitions. The US' heavily armored, 90&nbsp;mm [[M48 Patton|M48A3 Patton tank]] saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with US Forces. They played an important role in infantry support.

The American [[M16 rifle|M16]], which replaced the [[M14 rifle|M14]], was considered more accurate and was lighter than the AK-47 but was prone to jamming. The gun frequently suffered from a jamming flaw known as "failure to extract", which means that a spent cartridge case remained lodged in the action after a round is fired.<ref name=Reliable>{{cite journal|author=C.H. Chivers|title= How Reliable is the M16 Rifle?|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=2 November 2009|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/how-reliable-is-the-m-16-rifle/}}</ref> According to a congressional report, the jamming was caused primarily by a change in gunpowder which was done without adequate testing and reflected a decision for which the safety of soldiers was a secondary consideration.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Maraniss|title=They Marched into Sunlight: War and Peace Vietnam and America October 1967|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qftwHKSnmpkC&pg=PA410|year=2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-6255-2|page=410}}</ref>

The [[M60 machine gun]] GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun) was the main machine gun of the US army at the time and many of them were put on helicopters, to provide [[suppressive fire]] when landing in hostile regions. The MAC-10 [[machine pistol]] was supplied to many special forces troops in the midpoint of the war. It also armed many CIA agents in the field.

Two aircraft which were prominent in the war were the [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 "Spectre"]] Gunship and the [[UH-1]] "Huey" gunship. The AC-130 was a heavily armed [[attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]] variant of the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] transport plane; it was used to provide [[close air support]], [[air interdiction]] and [[force protection]]. The AC-130H "Spectre" was armed with two 20&nbsp;mm [[M61 Vulcan]] cannons, one [[Bofors 40mm]] autocannon, and one 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer]]<!-- Yes, you read it correctly: a 105 mm howitzer, sticking right out of the left side of the plane!!! -->. The Huey is a [[military helicopter]] powered by a single, [[turboshaft]] engine, with a two-bladed main rotor and tail rotor. Approximately 7,000 UH-1 aircraft saw service in Vietnam.

The [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore M18A1]], an anti-personnel mine, was widely used during the war. Unlike a conventional land mine, the Claymore is command-detonated and directional, meaning it is fired by remote-control and shoots a pattern of metal balls into the [[kill zone]] like a [[shotgun]].

The aircraft ordnance used during the war included [[precision-guided munition]], [[cluster bomb]]s, and [[napalm]], a [[thickening]]/[[gelling agent|gelling]] agent generally mixed with petroleum or a similar fuel for use in an [[incendiary device]], initially against buildings and later primarily as an anti-personnel weapon that sticks to skin and can burn down to the bone.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Effect on the United States===

''Examining Issues Through Political Cartoons: The Vietnam War'' pp. 14–15.</ref> As General [[Maxwell D. Taylor|Maxwell Taylor]], one of the principal architects of the war, noted, "First, we didn't know ourselves. We thought that we were going into another [[Korean War]], but this was a different country. Secondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies… And we knew less about North Vietnam. Who was [[Ho Chi Minh]]? Nobody really knew. So, until we know the enemy and know our allies and know ourselves, we'd better keep out of this kind of dirty business. It's very dangerous."<ref name = "Karnow 1997 23">{{Harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=23}}.</ref><ref>Taylor paraphrases Sun Tzu, ''[[The Art of War]]'', trans. Samuel B. Griffith. Oxford, UK. Oxford University Press, 1963.</ref> President [[Ronald Reagan]] coined the term "[[Vietnam Syndrome]]" to describe the reluctance of the American public and politicians to support further international interventions after Vietnam.

Some have suggested that "the responsibility for the ultimate failure of this policy [America's withdrawal from Vietnam] lies not with the men who fought, but with those in Congress…"<ref>{{cite web | archiveurl = http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090331152606/http://www.vietnamwar.com/presidentnixonsrole.htm | archivedate = 31 March 2009 | url= http://www.vietnamwar.com/presidentnixonsrole.htm |title= President Richard Nixon's Role in the Vietnam War |publisher= Vietnam War | accessdate =17 October 2009}}</ref> Alternatively, the official history of the [[United States Army]] noted that "[[military tactics|tactics]] have often seemed to exist apart from larger issues, strategies, and objectives. Yet in Vietnam the Army experienced tactical success and strategic failure… The…Vietnam War…legacy may be the lesson that unique historical, political, cultural, and social factors always impinge on the military…Success rests not only on military progress but on correctly analyzing the nature of the particular conflict, understanding the enemy's strategy, and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of allies.

U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in a secret memo to president Gerald Ford that "in terms of military tactics, we cannot help draw the conclusion that our armed forces are not suited to this kind of war.

The inability to bring Hanoi to the bargaining table by bombing also illustrated another U.S. miscalculation.

===Effects of U.S. chemical defoliation===
[[File:Defoliation agent spraying.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. helicopter spraying chemical [[defoliant]]s in the [[Mekong Delta]], South Vietnam]]
One of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort in Southeast Asia was the widespread use of chemical [[defoliant]]s between 1961 and 1971. They were used to [[Wikt:defoliate|defoliate]] large parts of the countryside to prevent the Viet Cong from being able to hide their weapons and encampments under the foliage. These chemicals continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Palmer|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|2007}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Lynne Peeples|date=10 July 2013|title=Veterans Sick From Agent Orange-Poisoned Planes Still Seek Justice|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/agent-orange-vietnam-veterans_n_3572598.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>

Early in the American military effort, it was decided that since the enemy were hiding their activities under triple-canopy jungle, a useful first step might be to defoliate certain areas. This was especially true of growth surrounding bases (both large and small) in what became known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]]. Corporations like [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[Monsanto]] were given the task of developing herbicides for this purpose. American officials also pointed out that the British had previously used [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]] (virtually identical to America's use in Vietnam) on a large scale throughout the [[Malayan Emergency]] in the 1950s in order to destroy bushes, crops, and trees in effort to deny communist insurgents the concealment they needed to ambush passing convoys.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |author=Bruce Cumings |year=1998 |publisher=[[Earthscan]]}}</ref> Indeed, Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] told President [[John F. Kennedy]] on 24 November 1961, that "[t]he use of defoliant does not violate any rule of [[international law]] concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use of aircraft for destroying crops by chemical spraying."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v01/d275 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963 Volume I, Vietnam, 1961, Document 275 |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref>

The defoliants, which were distributed in drums marked with color-coded bands, included the "[[Rainbow Herbicides]]"—[[Agent Pink]], [[Agent Green]], [[Agent Purple]], [[Agent Blue]], [[Agent White]], and, most famously, [[Agent Orange]], which included [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] as a by-product of its manufacture. About 12 million gallons (45,000,000&nbsp;L) of Agent Orange were sprayed over Southeast Asia during the American involvement.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} A prime area of Ranch Hand operations was in the [[Mekong Delta]], where the U.S. Navy patrol boats were vulnerable to attack from the undergrowth at the water's edge.

In 1961 and 1962, the Kennedy administration authorized the use of chemicals to destroy rice crops. Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S. Air Force sprayed 20 million U.S. gallons (75,700,000&nbsp;L) of concentrated herbicides over 6 million acres (24,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of crops and trees, affecting an estimated 13% of South Vietnam's land. In 1965, 42% of all herbicide was sprayed over food crops. Another purpose of herbicide use was to drive civilian populations into RVN-controlled areas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kolko|1985|pp=144–5}}.</ref>

Vietnamese victims affected by Agent Orange attempted a class action lawsuit against Dow Chemical and other US chemical manufacturers, but [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|District Court]] Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] dismissed their case.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=380}}.<br/>In his 234-page judgment, Weinstein observed: "Despite the fact that Congress and the President were fully advised of a substantial belief that the herbicide spraying in Vietnam was a violation of international law, they acted on their view that it was not a violation at the time."</ref> They appealed, but the dismissal was cemented in February 2008 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Crook|2008}}.</ref> As of 2006, the Vietnamese government estimates that there are over 4,000,000 victims of [[dioxin]] poisoning in Vietnam, although the United States government denies any conclusive scientific links between Agent Orange and the Vietnamese victims of dioxin poisoning. In some areas of southern Vietnam, dioxin levels remain at over 100 times the accepted international standard.<ref>{{cite web|author=Anthony Faiola|date=13 November 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111201065.html|title=In Vietnam, Old Foes Take Aim at War's Toxic Legacy|publisher=[[The Washington Post|washingtonpost.com]]|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref>

The Vietnam War has been featured extensively in television, film, video games, and literature in the participant countries. In American popular culture, the "Crazy Vietnam Veteran", who was suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], became a common [[stock character]] after the war.

One of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was [[John Wayne]]'s pro-war film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968). Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)&nbsp;– based on his service in the [[U.S. Military]] during the Vietnam War, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), and ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989). Later films would include ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' (2007).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded [[The "Fish" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag|"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag" / The "Fish" Cheer]] in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
