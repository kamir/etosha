==Career==

===Early career===
Izzard began to toy with comedy at the [[University of Sheffield]], with student friend Rob Ballard.<ref name="thsndytmes_appleyard"/><ref name="latimes_taylor"/> After leaving his accountancy degree course, he and Ballard took their act to the streets,<ref name="thsndytmes_appleyard"/><ref name="latimes_taylor"/> often in [[Covent Garden]].<ref name="latimes_brownfield"/><ref name="indpndnt_burrell"/><ref name="thisislondon_dessau"/> After his split with Ballard, Izzard spent a great deal of the early 1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States. He then moved his act into the stand-up comedy venues of Britain. His first gig was at the Banana Cabaret in [[Balham]], London.<ref name="sydmornher_1"/><ref name="itunes_amstell"/>

In 1987, he made his first stage appearance at [[The Comedy Store, London|the Comedy Store]] in London.<ref name="indpndnt_sweeney"/>  He refined his material throughout the 1980s, and in the early 1990s he finally began earning some measure of recognition through his improvisation, in part at his own club "Raging Bull" in [[Soho]].<ref name="thisislondon_dessau"/>

===Theatrical, TV and film appearances===
In 1994, Izzard made his West End drama debut as the lead in the world premiere of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[The Cryptogram]]'' with [[Lindsay Duncan]], in the production at London's Comedy Theatre.

In 1995, he portrayed the title character in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]''.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre--another-piece-of-the-puzzle-paul-taylor-on-david-mamets-the-cryptogram-with-lindsay-duncan-and-the-comedian-eddie-izzard-1410874.html]]</ref>

In 1998 Izzard appeared briefly on stage with the Monty Python team in ''The American Film Institute's Tribute to Monty Python'' (also referred to as ''[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]]''). He walked on stage with the five surviving Pythons and he was summarily escorted off by [[Eric Idle]] and [[Michael Palin]] as he attempted to participate in a discussion about how the group got together.<ref>[http://www.britishclassiccomedy.co.uk/monty-python-live-at-aspen-1998]</ref>

Izzard portrayed comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] in the 1999 production of Julian Barry's 1971 play ''Lenny''. In 2001, he replaced [[Clive Owen]] in [[Peter Nichols]]' 1967 play ''[[A Day in the Death of Joe Egg]]'' at the [[Comedy Theatre]].

==Comic style==
[[File:Elliott Gould and Eddie Lzzard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elliott Gould]] and Eddie Izzard]]
Izzard uses a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps between topics. As he put it in a 2004 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', "It's the oral tradition. Human beings have been doing it for thousands of years".<ref name="guardian_bedell"/> His bent towards the surreal even went so far as to produce a sitcom called ''[[Cows (TV series)|Cows]]'' in 1997 for [[Channel 4]], a live action comedy with actors dressed in cowsuits.<ref name="auntimomo_1"/>

==Personal life==
During his ''Stripped'' tour, Izzard said he realised he was an [[atheist]]. "I was warming the material up in [[New York City|New York]], where one night, literally on stage, I realised I didn't believe in God at all. I just didn't think there was anyone upstairs."<ref name="Hollywood Commons"/> He keeps his romantic life private, saying one of the reasons is due to the wishes of his companions not wanting to become content for his show.<ref name="Hollywood Commons"/> Izzard dated [[Sarah Townsend]], the director of the documentary ''Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story'',<ref name="indpndnt_burrell"/> whom he first met while she was running a [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe]] venue at the Edinburgh Festival in 1989.<ref name="newsscotsman_hoggard"/>

He supports [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] and on 16 July 2012 he became an associate director at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/article/izzard-joins-palace-as-associate-director-239693.aspx|title=Izzard Becomes Associate Director|author=CrystalPalaceFC_user|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

Izzard is a supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and in September 2011 declared his ambition to stand for the party in the future as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]] or as [[Mayor of London]],<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15088430 Eddie Izzard: 'I will run for mayor, MEP or MP in 2020']. BBC, 28 September 2011.</ref> announcing an intention to stand for the [[London mayoral election]] in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/who-will-be-labours-next-mayor-of-london-8789685.html|title=Who will be Labour's next Mayor of London|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=19 September 2013|author=Marchant, Rob|work=The Independent}}</ref> When asked on comedy panel show ''[[The Last Leg]]'' why he thought he might be elected, Izzard replied "[[Boris Johnson]]".<ref>[http://www.3news.co.nz/Eddie-Izzard-will-run-for-London-Mayor-in-2020/tabid/418/articleID/314716/Default.aspx Eddie Izzard will run for London Mayor in 2020]. ''3 News NZ''. 26 September 2013.</ref>

Izzard is also a [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]], believing that Britain should have a democratically elected [[Head of State]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/being-a-transvestite-has-toughened-me-up-for-politics-says-izzard-9690042.html|title=Being a transvestite has toughened me up for politics, says Izzard|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> He has stated that he is a [[social democrat]], not a [[socialist]].<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/dec/02/comedy-celebrity-eddie-izzard</ref>

===Transvestism===
Izzard started to freely talk about his [[transvestism]] in venues like Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992.<ref name="guardian_05_2001"/><ref name="independent_lister"/> His stance is that cross-dressing is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Visco|first=Gerry|title=Eddie Izzard, Force of Nature|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/eddie-izzard|work=Interview Magazine|accessdate=22 May 2014|date=May 2014}}</ref> He remarks in his show ''[[Unrepeatable]]'', "Women wear what they want and so do I".

===Activism===
Izzard has engaged in campaigning work. He is especially well known as a pro-[[European Union]] campaigner supporting the further integration of the UK into the EU. In May 2005, he appeared on the BBC's political debate show ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', describing himself as a "British-European", comparing this with other cultural identities such as "African-American". As part of his integration campaigning, he was one of the first people to spend a euro in London. This pan-European approach has influenced his work: he regularly performs in French,<ref name="hitfix_fienberg"/><ref name="indpndnt_burrell"/> and occasionally in German,<ref name="thisislondon_dessau"/> in addition to English. 

In July 2003, Izzard received an honorary [[Doctorate of Letters]] from the [[University of East Anglia|University of East Anglia, Norwich]], for "pro-Europe campaigning", "his contribution to promoting modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and lifestyles" and for having "transcended national barriers" with his humour.<ref name="eastanglia_2007"/>

In 1998, Izzard was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party.<ref name="bbc_19980830"/> He appeared in a party political broadcast for the Labour Party in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].

On 20 July 2006, he received an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Sheffield]],<ref name="shef_honrdoct"/> where he spent one year on an Accounting and Financial Management course in the early 1980s. During his time at the university he established the now-defunct Alternative Productions Society in the Union of Students with the aim of promoting fringe-based arts. On 4 March 2010, he was elected as the Honorary President of the [[University of Sheffield]] [[University of Sheffield Union of Students|Students' Union]].<ref name="shef_elec2010"/>

On 7 July 2007, Izzard was one of the presenters from the [[Live Earth concert, London|London leg]] of [[Live Earth]].

All proceeds from the performance of 23 June 2008 were donated to Neighbourhood Housing Services of New Orleans.<ref name="nola_20080610"/>

In March 2014 Izzard began leading a campaign encouraging Scots not to vote for independence in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|September referendum]], saying that England would feel a "deep sense of loss" if Scotland were to leave the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eddie-izzard-campaigns-against-scottish-independence-the-uk-would-feel-a-deep-sense-of-loss-if-scotland-left-9199722.html|location=London, UK|work=The Independent|first=Jenn|last=Selby|title=Eddie Izzard campaigns against Scottish Independence|date=18 March 2014}}</ref>

Izzard confirmed his support for Labour in the 2015 General Election, attending a party rally with fellow comedian [[Ben Elton]], and actress [[Sally Lindsay]] in April 2015.<ref>{{cite news | last = Elton | first = Ben | author-link = Ben Elton | title = Comedian Ben Elton hits out at Myleene Klass over her mansion tax claims | url = http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/04/comedian-ben-elton-hits-out-at-myleene-klass-over-her-mansion-tax-claims | date = 4 April 2015 | accessdate = 23 April 2015 | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] }}</ref> In a post-rally interview Izzard confirmed his intention to stand for election as an MP or Mayor of London in 2020.

The blog ''Eddie Iz Running'' was a document of his [[road running]] [[marathon]], in which he ran 43 marathons in 51 days. He completed the run on 15 September 2009, after having run at least 27 miles each day, 6 days a week for 7 weeks straight, covering more than 1,100 miles.<ref name="comicrelief_1"/> Izzard received a special award at [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] in 2009 for his achievements.<ref name="bbc_20081213"/>
