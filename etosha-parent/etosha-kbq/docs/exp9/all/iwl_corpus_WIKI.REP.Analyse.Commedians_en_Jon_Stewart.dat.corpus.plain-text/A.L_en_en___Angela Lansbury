'''Dame Angela Brigid Lansbury''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (born October 16, 1925) is an English-American actress and singer <!-- holds dual citizenship --> who has appeared in theatre, television, and films. Her career has spanned seven decades, much of it based in the United States, and her work has attracted international attention.

Lansbury was born in central London to actress [[Moyna Macgill]] and politician [[Edgar Lansbury (politician)|Edgar Lansbury]]. In 1940, she moved to New York City in the United States, where she studied acting. Proceeding to Hollywood, Los Angeles in 1942, she signed to [[MGM]] and got her first film roles, in ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945), earning her two [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award]]. She appeared in eleven further MGM films, mostly in minor roles, and after her contract ended in 1952 she began supplementing her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Although her appearance in the film adaptation of ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962) was widely acclaimed, she finally gained stardom for her theatrical starring role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966). Relocating from California to [[County Cork]], Ireland in 1970, she continued with a variety of theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout that decade.

Moving to television in 1984, Lansbury achieved widespread fame as the fictional writer and sleuth [[Jessica Fletcher]] in the American murder mystery series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', which ran for twelve seasons until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running detective drama series in television history.  She assumed ownership of the series and was executive producer for the final four seasons. In addition to the television series, Lansbury's visage graces the covers of the long-running paperback series by the same name, which inspired the television show, that is written by [[Donald Bain]] and [[Jessica Fletcher]].

She also moved into voice work, thereby contributing to animated films like [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). Since then, she has toured prolifically in a variety of international productions, and continued to make occasional film appearances.

Lansbury has won an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]], five [[Tony Award]]s, six [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and an [[Olivier Awards|Olivier Award]]. She has also been nominated for numerous other industry awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] on three occasions, and various [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s on eighteen occasions. Further, she has been cited as both a gay icon and an American icon, with a cult fan following.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1925–42===

Lansbury was born in Hamilton Terrace, Regent's Park, London, United Kingdom on October 16, 1925.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=3|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=3}} Although her birthplace has often been cited as [[Poplar, London|Poplar, East London]],{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=3}} she has rejected this, asserting that while she had ancestral connections to Poplar, she was born in the [[Regent's Park]] area of Central London.{{sfn|Selby|2014|p=4}}<ref Name=Frontrow>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03srj0y/Front_Row_Angela_Lansbury_Richard_Deacon_Philip_Seymour_Hoffman/ Interview with Mark Lawson], 'Front Row', BBC Radio 4, February 3, 2014; "I want to make one thing clear: I was not born in Poplar, that's not true, I was born in Regent's Park, so I wasn't born in the East End, I wish I could say I had been. Certainly my antecedents were: my grandfather, my father." (mins 3–4)</ref> Her mother was [[Belfast]]-born Irish actress [[Moyna Macgill]] (born Charlotte Lillian McIldowie), who regularly appeared on stage in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and who had also starred in several films.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=3–4|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=5–10|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=8}} Her father was the wealthy English timber merchant and politician [[Edgar Lansbury (politician)|Edgar Lansbury]], a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and former mayor of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=4|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=3}} Her paternal grandfather was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] and anti-war activist [[George Lansbury]], a man she felt "awed" by, considering him "a giant in my youth".{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=4–5|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=15–20|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=9–10}} Angela had an older half sister, Isolde, who was the offspring of Moyna's previous marriage to [[Reginald Denham]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=5|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=3|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=7}} In January 1930, when Angela was four, her mother gave birth to twin boys, [[Bruce Lansbury|Bruce]] and [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar]], leading the Lansburys to move from their Poplar flat to a house at 7 Weymouth Avenue, [[Mill Hill]], [[North London]]; on weekends they would retreat to a farm in [[Berrick Salome]], Oxfordshire.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=4|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=11–15}}

When Lansbury was nine, her father died from [[stomach cancer]]; she retreated into playing characters as a coping mechanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=12|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=21}} In 2014, Lansbury described this event as "the defining moment of my life. Nothing before or since has affected me so deeply."{{sfn|Selby|2014|p=4}} Facing financial difficulty, her mother became engaged to a Scottish colonel, Leckie Forbes, and moved into his house in [[Hampstead]], with Angela receiving an education at [[South Hampstead High School]] from 1934 until 1939.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=11–12, 21|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=26–28}} She nevertheless considered herself largely self-educated, learning from books, theater and cinema.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=14|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=24}} She became a self-professed "complete movie maniac", visiting the cinema regularly and imagining herself as certain characters.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=13–14}} Keen on playing the piano, she briefly studied music at the Ritman School of Dancing, and then in 1940 began studying acting at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art|Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art]] in [[Kensington]], [[List of sub regions used in the London Plan|West London]], first appearing onstage as a lady-in-waiting in the school's production of [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=6|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=22|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=28–31}}

That year, Angela's grandfather died, and with the onset of [[The Blitz]], Macgill decided to take Angela, Bruce and Edgar to the United States; Isolde remained in Britain with her new husband, the actor [[Peter Ustinov]]. Macgill secured a job supervising sixty British children who were being evacuated to North America aboard the ''Duchess of Athol'', arriving in [[Montreal]], Canada, in mid-August.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=7|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=24–25|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=31–35}} From there, she proceeded by train to New York City, where she was financially sponsored by the [[Wall Street]] businessman Charles T. Smith, moving in with his family at their home by [[Lake Mahopac]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=25–26|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=35–36}} Angela gained a scholarship from the [[American Theatre Wing]] allowing her to study at the [[Feagin School of Dramatic Art|Feagin School of Drama and Radio]], where she appeared in performances of [[William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]''. She graduated in March 1942, by which time the family had moved to a flat at 55 Morton Street, [[Greenwich Village]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=8–9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=26|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=36–41}}

===''Gaslight'' and ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'': 1942–45===

McGill secured work in a Canadian touring production of ''[[Tonight at 8:30]]'', and was joined in Canada by Angela, who gained her first theatrical job as a nightclub act at the Samovar Club, Montreal. Having gained the job by claiming to be 19 when she was 16, her act consisted of her singing songs by [[Noël Coward]], and earned her $60 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=29|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=44}} She returned to New York City in August 1942, but her mother had moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, in order to resurrect her cinematic career; Lansbury and her brothers followed.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=29–30|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=44}} Moving into a bungalow in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]], both Angela and her mother obtained Christmas jobs at the [[Bullocks Wilshire]] department store in Los Angeles; Moyna was fired for incompetence, leaving the family to subsist on Angela's paycheck of $28 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=9|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=32–33|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=46–47}} Befriending a group of gay men, Angela became privy to the city's underground gay scene,{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=50}} and with her mother attended lectures by the spiritual guru [[Krishnamurti]], at one of these meeting [[Aldous Huxley]].{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=50}}

At a party hosted by her mother, Angela met John van Druten, who had recently co-authored a script for ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), a mystery-thriller based on [[Patrick Hamilton (writer)|Patrick Hamilton]]'s 1938 play, ''[[Gas Light]]''. Set in Victorian London, the film was being directed by [[George Cukor]] and starred [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Druten suggested that Lansbury would be perfect for the role of Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although because she was 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with [[MGM]], earning $500 a week and adopting "Angela Lansbury" as her stage name.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=11–12|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=36–41|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=53–57, 59–62}} Upon release, ''Gaslight'' received mixed critical reviews, although Lansbury's role was widely praised; the film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Lansbury.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=13|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=42|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=62}}

Her next film appearance was as Edwina Brown, a minor character in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944); the film proved to be a major commercial hit, with Lansbury developing a lifelong friendship with co-star [[Elizabeth Taylor]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=13|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=43|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=63}} Lansbury next starred in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945), a cinematic adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1890 [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|novel of the same name]], which was again set in Victorian London. Directed by [[Albert Lewin]], Lansbury was cast as Sybil Vane, a working-class [[music hall]] singer who falls in love with the protagonist, [[Dorian Gray]] ([[Hurd Hatfield]]). Although the film was not a financial success, Lansbury's performance once more drew praise, earning her a [[Golden Globe Award]], and she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, losing to [[Anne Revere]], her co-star in ''National Velvet''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=14–15|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=45–47|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=52–62, 66–69}}

===Later MGM films: 1945–51===

On September 27, 1945, Lansbury married [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]], an artist and decorator whose acting career had come to a standstill. Their marriage was troubled; Cromwell was gay, and had married Lansbury in the unsuccessful hope that it would [[Sexual orientation change efforts|turn him heterosexual]]. The marriage ended in less than a year when she filed for divorce on September 11, 1946, but they remained friends until his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=15|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=48–55|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=77–79, 81–83}} In December 1946, she was introduced to [[Peter Shaw (producer)|Peter Pullen Shaw]] at a party held by former co-star Hurd Hatfield in [[Ojai Valley]]. Shaw was an aspiring actor, also signed to MGM, and had recently left a relationship with [[Joan Crawford]]. He and Lansbury became a couple, living together before she proposed marriage.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=23–24|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=81–85|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=87–91}} They were intent on getting married back in Britain, but the [[Church of England]] refused to marry two divorcees. Instead, they wed at [[St Columba's Church, London|St. Columba's Church]], a place of worship under the jurisdiction of the [[Church of Scotland]], in Knightsbridge, London in August 1949, followed by a honeymoon in France.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=24–26|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=85–87|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=96–97}} Returning to the U.S., where they settled into Lansbury's home in Rustic Canyon, [[Malibu, California|Malibu]],{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=76|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=85}} in 1951 the couple each became [[Citizenship in the United States|naturalized U.S. citizens]], albeit retained their British citizenship through a process of [[dual nationality]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=90|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=101}}

[[File:Angela Lansbury in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|left|thumb|Lansbury in a scene from MGM's ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946), one of her earliest film appearances]]
Following on from the success of ''Gaslight'' and ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'', MGM cast Lansbury in eleven further films until her contract with the company ended in 1952. Keeping her among their B-list stars, it used her less than their similar-aged actresses; biographers Edelman and Kupferberg believed that the majority of these films were "mediocre", doing little to further her career.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=57–62, 64}} This view was echoed by Cukor, who believed Lansbury had been "consistently miscast" by MGM.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=57}} She was repeatedly made to portray older characters, typically villainesses, and as a result became increasingly dissatisfied with working for MGM, commenting that "I kept wanting to play the [[Jean Arthur]] roles, and [[Louis B. Mayer|Mr Mayer]] kept casting me as a series of venal bitches."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=65–66}} The company themselves were suffering from the post-1948 slump in cinema sales, as a result slashing film budgets and cutting their number of staff as a result.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=65–66}}

1946 saw Lansbury play her first American character as Em, a honky-tonk saloon singer in the Oscar-winning [[Wild West]] musical ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=18–19|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=59|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=71–75}} She appeared in ''[[The Hoodlum Saint]]'' (1946), ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1947), ''[[If Winter Comes]]'' (1947) – a film which she particularly despised – ''[[Tenth Avenue Angel]]'' (1948), ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1948), ''[[State of the Union]]'' (1948), often considered her strongest role of the period, and ''[[The Red Danube]]'' (1949). She was loaned by MGM first to [[United Artists]] for their film, ''[[The Private Affairs of Bel Ami]]'' (1947), and then to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949).{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=19–21, 27–33|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=69–71, 75|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=79–80, 84, 87, 91–94, 97–99}} She appeared as a maidservant in ''[[Kind Lady (1951 film)|Kind Lady]]'' (1951), as a French adventuress in ''[[Mutiny (film)|Mutiny]]'' (1952) and as a villainess in ''[[Remains to Be Seen]]'' (1953).{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=34–35, 37, 41|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=92–93}} Turning to radio, in 1948 Lansbury appeared in an audio adaptation of [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' for ''[[NBC University Theatre]]'', and the following year she starred in their adaptation of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=98}} Moving into television, she appeared in a 1950 episode of ''[[Robert Montgomery Presents]]'' adapted from [[A.J.

[[File:Angela Lansbury NYWTS.jpg|thumb|200px|Lansbury with her children in 1957]]

Unhappy with the roles she was being given by MGM, Lansbury instructed her manager, Harry Friedman of [[MCA Inc.]], to terminate her contract in 1952.{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=100}} She was pregnant with Shaw's child, and that year her son Anthony was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=37|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=90|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=101–102}} Soon after the birth she joined the East Coast touring productions of two former-Broadway plays: [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]]'s ''Remains to be Seen'' and [[Louis Verneuil]]'s ''Affairs of State.''{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=41|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=90|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=101–102}} Biographer Margaret Bonanno later stated that at this point, Lansbury's career had "hit an all-time low".{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=41}} In April 1953, her daughter Deirdre Angela Shaw was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=37|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=90|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3p=102}} Shaw himself had a son by a previous marriage, David, and gaining legal custody of the boy in 1953 he brought him to California to live with the family; now with three children to care for, Lansbury moved to a larger house in San Vincente Boulevard in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=89|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=104}} However, Lansbury did not feel entirely comfortable in the Hollywood social scene, later asserting that as a result of her British roots, "in Hollywood, I always felt like a stranger in a strange land."{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=122}} In 1959 the family relocated to Malibu, settling into a house on the Pacific Coast Highway that had been designed by [[Aaron Green]]; there, she and Peter escaped the Hollywood scene, and were able to send their children to [[state school]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1p=38|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=115–116}}

In April 1957 she debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Henry Miller Theatre]] in ''[[Hotel Paradiso]],'' a French [[burlesque]] set in [[Paris, France|Paris]], directed by [[Peter Glenville]]. The play only ran for 15 weeks, although she earned good reviews for her role as "Marcel Cat;" she later stated had she not appeared in the play, her "whole career would have fizzled out."{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=39, 45–48|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2p=100|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=105–110}} She followed this with an appearance in 1960s Broadway performance of ''[[A Taste of Honey]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]], directed by [[Tony Richardson]] and [[George Devine]]. Lansbury played Helen, the boorish, verbally abusive, otherwise absentee mother of Josephine (played by [[Joan Plowright]], only four years Lansbury's junior), remarking that she gained "a great deal of satisfaction" from the role.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=54–55|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=102–104|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=117–122}} During the show's run, Lansbury developed a friendship with her co-star [[Joan Plowright]], as well as with Plowright's lover [[Laurence Olivier]]; it was from Lansbury's rented apartment on East 97th Street that Plowright and Olivier eloped to be married.{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|pp=120–121}}

After a well-reviewed appearance in ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (film)|Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1959) – for which she had filmed in the Australian [[Outback]] – and a minor role in ''[[A Breath of Scandal]]'' (1960), she appeared in 1961's ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' as the mother of a character played by [[Elvis Presley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=51, 53, 56–57|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=107–108|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=114–115, 124–125}} Acknowledging that the film was of poor quality, she commented that she agreed to appear in it because "I was desperate".{{sfn|Bonanno|1987|p=57}} Her role as Mavis in ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]'' (1960) drew critical acclaim, as did her appearance in ''[[All Fall Down (film)|All Fall Down]]'' (1962) as a manipulative, destructive mother.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=52–53, 58–59|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1pp=112–116|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2pp=112–114, 125–127}} In 1962 she appeared in the [[Cold War]] thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' as Eleanor Iselin, cast for the role by [[John Frankenheimer]]. Although Lansbury played actor Laurence Harvey's mother in the film, she was in fact only ''three years'' older than him.{{sfnm|1a1=Bonanno|1y=1987|1pp=59–62|2a1=Edelman|2a2=Kupferberg|2y=1996|2pp=117–121|3a1=Gottfried|3y=1999|3pp=127–130}} She had agreed to appear in the film after reading the original novel, describing it as "one of the most exciting political books I ever read".{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=127}} Biographers Edelman and Kupferberg considered this role "her enduring cinematic triumph,"{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=116}} while Gottfried stated that it was "the strongest, the most memorable, and the best picture she ever made... she gives her finest film performance in it."{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=130}} Lansbury received her third Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination for the film, and was bothered by the fact that she lost.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelman|1a2=Kupferberg|1y=1996|1p=120|2a1=Gottfried|2y=1999|2p=130}}

She followed this with a performance as Sybil Logan in ''[[In the Cool of the Day]]'' (1963) – a film she renounced as awful – before appearing as wealthy Isabel Boyd in ''[[The World of Henry Orient]]'' (1964) and the widow Phyllis in ''[[Dear Heart]]'' (1964).{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=109–111}} Her first appearance in a theatrical musical was the short-lived ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964), written by [[Arthur Laurents]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]]. An experimental work, it opened at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] on Broadway, but was critically panned and closed after nine performances.

===''Mame'' and theatrical stardom: 1966–69===

In 1966, she took on the title role of Mame Dennis in the musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', [[Jerry Herman]]'s musical adaptation of the novel ''[[Auntie Mame]]''. The director's first choice for the role had been [[Rosalind Russell]], who had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role in the hope that it would mark a change in her career. When she was chosen for the role, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed it would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was forty years old, and this was her first major role.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=128–132}} Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over twenty costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury's role involved a number of songs and dance routines.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=133–134}} First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, ''Mame'' opened at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on Broadway in May 1966.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=134}} Reviews of Lansbury's performance were outstandingly positive.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=135}} In ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Stanley Kauffmann]] wrote: "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not a singer or dancer who also acts...

Lansbury followed the success of ''Mame'' with a performance as Countess Aurelia, the 75-year-old Parisian eccentric in ''Dear World'', a musical adaptation of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]''. The show opened at Broadway's [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] in February 1969, but Lansbury found it a "pretty depressing" experience. Reviews of her performance were positive, and she was awarded her second Tony Award on the basis of it. Reviews of the show more generally were critical, however, and it ended after 132 performances.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=148–151}}<ref name=tonyaward>[http://sanfrancisco.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardssearch.cfm "Tony Award, Lansbury"]. broadwayworld.com.

===Ireland and ''Gypsy'': 1970–78===

She turned down several cinematic roles, declining the lead in ''[[The Killing of Sister George]]'' and the role of Nurse Ratched in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=153}} Instead, she accepted the role of the Countess von Ornstein, an aging German aristocrat who falls in love with a younger man, in ''[[Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), and in the same year also appeared as the middle-aged English witch Miss Price in the Disney film ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''. The latter was her first lead in a screen musical, and led to her publicizing the film on television programs like ''The [[David Frost]] Show''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=155–159}}
1970 was a traumatic year for the Lansbury family, as Peter underwent a hip replacement, and in September, their Malibu home was destroyed in a brush fire.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=169}} They purchased a house in rural [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland]], and took Anthony there to recover from his drug addiction after he quit using cocaine and heroin in 1971.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=167}} He subsequently enrolled in the Webber-Douglas School, his mother's ''alma mater'', and became a professional actor, before moving into television directing.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=170}} Angela and her husband did not return to California, instead dividing their time between Cork and New York City, where they lived in an apartment opposite [[Lincoln Center]].{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=170}}

In 1972, Lansbury returned to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] to perform in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s theatrical production of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''All Over'' at the [[Aldwych Theatre]]. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play's reviews were mixed, Lansbury's acting was widely praised.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=170, 181–182}} This was followed by a revival of ''Mame'', which was then touring the United States,{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=182}} after which she returned to the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of [[Ethel Merman]], who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production, but eventually accepted it; when the show started in May 1973, she earned a standing ovation and rave reviews. Settling into a [[Belgravia]] flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=183–187}} Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 ''Gypsy'' went on a tour of the U.S., and in Chicago Lansbury was awarded the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975; a critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=187–190}} After several months' break, ''Gypsy'' then toured throughout the country again in the summer of 1975.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=190–192}}

Desiring to move from musicals, Lansbury decided that she wanted to appear in a production of one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. She obtained the role of Gertrude in the [[National Theatre Company]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', staged at the [[Old Vic]] theatre. Directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]], the production ran from December 1975 to May 1976, to mixed reviews; Lansbury later commented that she "hated" the role, believing it too restrained.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=191–193}} Her mood was worsened by the November 1975 death of her mother Moyna in California; Angela had her body cremated and the ashes scattered near their Irish home.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=170, 192}} Her next theatrical appearance was in two one-act plays by Edward Albee, ''Counting the Ways'' and ''Listening'', performed side by side at the Hartford Stage Company in [[Connecticut]]. Reviews of the production were mixed, although Lansbury was again singled out for praise.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=193–194}} This was followed by another revival tour of ''Gypsy''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=194}} In April 1978, Lansbury then appeared in 24 performances of ''[[The King and I]]'' revival as Mrs Anna, replacing [[Constance Towers]], who was on a short break; it was staged in Broadway's [[Uris Theatre]].{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=194–195}} Her first cinematic role in 7 years was as novelist and murder victim Salome Otterbourne in  ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978), an adaptation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Death on the Nile|novel of the same name]] (1937). She starred alongside former brother-in-law [[Peter Ustinov]] and [[Bette Davis]], who became a close friend. The role earned Lansbury the [[National Board of Review]] award for Best Supporting Actress of 1978.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=204–205}}

===''Sweeney Todd'' and continued cinematic work: 1979–84===

In March 1979, Lansbury first appeared as [[Mrs. Lovett|Nellie Lovett]] in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', a [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical directed by [[Harold Prince]]. Opening at Broadway's [[Uris Theatre]], she starred alongside [[Len Cariou]] as Sweeney Todd, the murderous barber in 19th century London. After being offered the role, she jumped on the opportunity due to the involvement of Sondheim in the project; she commented that she loved "the extraordinary wit and intelligence of his lyrics."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=196–199}} She remained in the role for 14 months before being replaced by [[Dorothy Loudon]]; it received mixed critical reviews, although earned Lansbury her fourth Tony Award and ''[[After Dark (magazine)|After Dark]]'' magazine's Ruby Award for Broadway Performer of the Year.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=201–202}} She returned to the role in October 1980 for a ten-month tour of six U.S. cities; the production was also filmed, and broadcast on the [[Entertainment Channel]].{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=203}} In 1982, she took on the role of an upper middle-class housewife who champions workers' rights in ''A Little Family Business'', a farce set in [[Baltimore]].

It was critically panned and induced protests of racism from the [[Japanese-Americans|Japanese-American]] community.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=210–211}} That year, she was inducted into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]],{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=2}} and the following year appeared in a ''Mame'' revival at Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]. Although Lansbury was praised, the show was a commercial flop, with Lansbury noting that "I realized that it's not a show of today.

Lansbury worked prolifically in cinema, and 1979 also saw Lansbury appear as Miss Froy in ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1979 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', a remake of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s famous [[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|1938 film]].{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=205}} The following year she appeared in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'', another film based on [[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side|an Agatha Christie novel]], this time as [[Miss Marple]], a sleuth in 1950s [[Kent]]. Lansbury hoped to get away from the depiction of the role made famous by [[Margaret Rutherford]], instead returning to Christie's description of the character; in this she created a precursor to her later role of Jessica Fletcher. She was signed to appear in two sequels as Miss Marple, but these were never made.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=207–210}} Lansbury's next film was the animated ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' (1982), for which she provided the voice of the witch Mommy Fortuna.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=205}} Returning to musicals, she starred as Ruth in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1983), a film based on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[The Pirates of Penzance|comic opera of the same name]], and while filming it in London sang on a recording of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=206}} This was followed by an appearance as the grandmother in Gothic fantasy film ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=206–207}} Lansbury had also begun work for television, appearing in a 1982 television film with Bette Davis titled ''[[Little Gloria...

===''Murder, She Wrote'': 1984–1996===
[[File:Angela Lansbury.jpg|thumb|150px|Angela Lansbury in September 1989]]
In 1983, Lansbury was offered two main television roles, one in a sitcom and the other in a detective series; although her agents advocated the former, Lansbury instead went with the latter.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=217}}  The series, ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', centred on the character of [[Jessica Fletcher]], a retired school teacher from Cabot Cove, [[Maine]], who becomes a successful detective novelist after her husband's death, also solving murders that she comes across in her travels; Lansbury described the character as "an American [[Miss Marple]]."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=217}} The series had been created by [[Peter S. Fischer]], [[Richard Levinson]], and [[William Link]], who had earlier had success with ''[[Columbo]]'', and the role of Jessica Fletcher had been first offered to [[Jean Stapleton]], who had declined it.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=217–218}} The pilot episode, "The Murder of Sherlock Holmes", premiered on [[CBS]] on September 30, 1984, with the rest of the first season airing on Sundays from 8 to 9&nbsp;pm. Although critical reviews were mixed, it proved highly popular, with the pilot having a Nielsen rating of 18.9, and the first season being top in its time slot.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=219–222}} Designed as inoffensive family viewing, despite its topic the show eschewed depicting violence or gore, following the "[[whodunit]]" format rather than those of most contemporary U.S. crime shows; Lansbury herself commented that "best of all, there's no violence. I hate violence."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=226–227}}

Lansbury was defensive over Jessica Fletcher, having an input on the costumes that she would wear and rejecting pressure from network executives to put her in a relationship, believing that she should remain a strong single female.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=230–234}} When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit her personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=230–234}} She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=234}} Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as "a television landmark" in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like ''[[The Golden Girls]]''.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=218}} Lansbury herself noted that "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle-aged audience",{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=222}} and although it was most popular among [[senior citizens]], it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=225–227}} It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' on [[NBC]].{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=224–225}} In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, ''[[The Law & Harry McGraw]]'', although it was short-lived.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=223}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|align=left|quote="I know why [''Murder, She Wrote'' was a success]. There was never any blood, never any violence.

As the show went on, Lansbury assumed a larger role behind the scenes.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=241}} In 1989, her own company, [[Corymore Productions]], began co-producing the show with Universal.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=244}} Nevertheless, she began to tire of the series, and in particular the long working hours, stating that the 1990–91 season would be the show's last.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|pp=241–242, 244–245}} She changed her mind after being appointed executive producer for the 1992–93 season, something she felt "made it far more interesting to me."{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=248}} For the seventh season, the show's setting relocated to New York City, where Jessica had taken a job teaching criminology at Manhattan University; the move was an attempt to attract younger viewers.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=245}} Having become a "Sunday-night institution" in the U.S., the show's ratings improved during the early 1990s, becoming a Top Five program.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=247}} However, CBS executives, hoping to gain a larger audience, moved it to Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm, opposite [[NBC]]'s new sitcom, ''[[Friends]]''. Lansbury was reportedly angry at the move, believing it ignored the show's core audience.{{sfn|Edelman|Kupferberg|1996|p=248}} The series ended in 1996.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/murder-she-wrote/ " 'Murder She Wrote'"]
