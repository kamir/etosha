'''Busboy Productions''' is a [[production company]] that was launched by [[Jon Stewart]] in the mid-1990s when he was known for hosting ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' on [[MTV]].

In addition to Stewart, executive Chris McShane is in charge of development and production.<ref name="Ad Week">[http://www.adweek.com/mw/news/cabletv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000800423 Comedy Inks Deal With Stewart's Busboy] [http://www.adweek.com/ Ad Week] (February 15, 2005) retrieved on August 10, 2006</ref>

==Name==
The name of the company is a reference to how Stewart worked as a [[busboy]] in a [[Mexican food|Mexican]] restaurant as a young man. The company's [[vanity card]] features the sound of a glass being knocked over followed by Jon Stewart whispering "Oops. Sorry."

==History==
Shortly after ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' was canceled, Stewart signed a production deal with [[Miramax]] to star in at least two films per year and develop his own projects. However, Stewart starred in only three films for Miramax and no projects were ever produced.

After Stewart's success as host and producer of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Busboy Productions was revived. In 2002, Stewart approached [[NBC]] to create a show in which [[Stephen Colbert]] would star. That show never got off the ground.<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,15936,00.html?rsslatest Jon Stewart: TV Mogul] [http://www.eonline.com/ E! online] (February 15, 2005) retrieved on August 10, 2006</ref>

In 2005, Busboy Productions reached an agreement with [[Comedy Central]] to finance the production company. Comedy Central has a [[first look deal|first-look agreement]] of any project. If Comedy Central passes on a project, Busboy is free to shop them to other networks.<ref name="Ad Week"/><ref>[http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/18/jon_stewarts_product.html Jon Stewart's production co. may develop shows for other networks] [[Boing Boing]] (February 18, 2005) retrieved on August 8, 2006</ref>

===''The Colbert Report''===
{{Main|The Colbert Report}}

Busboy's first television production was [[The Colbert Report]], produced by Stewart, [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Ben Karlin]], and subject to a distribution agreement between Busboy Productions and [[Comedy Central]], which made certain that "the Report" would run through 2007. The Colbert Report was produced in association with Stephen Colbert's [[Spartina Productions]].

Jon Stewart joked in an interview with [[E!]], when asked if he would appear on the Report, that he "doesn't do start-ups" and would wait until the show set into a deeper footing. He has since made several appearances.

Colbert's response was that "His shadow is dark enough. I don't want to ask the source of darkness for help. I'm not interested in that same liberal claptrap. That meow, meow, meow, ironic detachment.  We're going to deal with truth on my show."<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/Pf/0,1527,17706,00.html Comedy Central Keeps Colbert] [http://www.eonline.com/ E!] (Nov 2, 2005) retrieved on August 10, 2006</ref>

While ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' is Busboy Production's first successful television show, the notice "Copyright (c) 2004 by Busboy Productions, Inc. All Rights Reserved" appeared at the bottom of the "Shadow Government" poster included in ''[[The Daily Show]]'s'' ''[[America (The Book)]]''.

{{Main|Important Things with Demetri Martin}}
Busboy Productions also launched ''[[Important Things with Demetri Martin]]'', a comedy show starring [[Demetri Martin]], in which he "alternates between taped sketches and stand-up performances in front of a studio audience". Jon Stewart took an active role in "shepherding" the pilot. [[Reuters]] reports:

{{Cquote|Lauren Corrao, executive vp original programming and development at Comedy Central, noted that Martin's style of humor is nothing like the sketch shows the network has previously tried. The pilot puts Martin's sly, thoughtful manner to use by having all the segments riff on "the important things" about ... chairs. Future episodes will give the same treatment to everything from apples to "what happens after we die," she said.<ref>[http://www.pugetsoundradio.com/cgi-bin/forum/Blah.pl?m-1191426246/  Jon Stewart producing new Comedy Central show], Reuters, (03-Oct-2007) retrieved May 3, 2013</ref>}}
