'''''The Jon Stewart Show''''' was a late night [[talk show]] hosted by [[comedian]] [[Jon Stewart]]. The program premiered on [[MTV]] in 1993 as a thirty-minute daily program. At the end of its first season, MTV's then-corporate sibling [[Paramount Television]] retooled the program, extended it to sixty minutes, and used it as a replacement for the canceled ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show|Arsenio Hall Show]]'' for the 1994—95 television season. While the show garnered high ratings on MTV, it was not a success in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] and was canceled in 1995.

==Guests==
Celebrity guests who made appearances on the show included [[Howard Stern]], [[David Letterman]], [[Jonathan Brandis]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Sherry Stringfield]], [[Lorenzo Lamas]], [[Bronson Pinchot]], [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[William Shatner]]. The show was also popular for showcasing the type of musical guests that usually were not seen on other talk shows, such as [[King's X]], [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], [[Blind Melon]], [[Killing Joke]], [[Buffalo Tom]], [[Diamanda Galás]], [[Slayer]], [[Van Halen]], [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]], [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Naughty by Nature]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Redd Kross]], [[Dom Pachino]], [[Faith No More]], [[Rocket from the Crypt]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[The Breeders]], [[Belly (band)|Belly]], [[Letters to Cleo]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[The Afghan Whigs]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Guided by Voices]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], and [[Pop Will Eat Itself]], as well as fringe sub-culture guests such as Rev. [[Ivan Stang]] of the [[Church of the SubGenius]].

The show was produced by [[Madeleine Smithberg]], the creator of ''[[The Daily Show]]''.

One of the more memorable episodes featured a performance by [[Marilyn Manson]], who threw instruments around the stage, and ended with a [[piggyback ride]] offstage by Jon Stewart. During the show's final episode, the audience was offered [[margarita]]s and taxicab rides home. This final episode featured a lengthy interview with David Letterman, who rarely appears on talk shows other than his own. The eleven members of (then-upcoming) MTV sketch show ''[[The State (TV series)|The State]]'' appeared as the last guests on the final episode of the half-hour version of the show, and ''The State'' cast members received Stewart's permission to "trash" the set with various implements of destruction.

==Cancellation==
After the show's cancellation, Stewart appeared in some minor television and film roles. Then, in January 1999 Stewart began hosting ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]], which at the time was partially owned by [[MTV Networks]]. He replaced the original host [[Craig Kilborn]], who had moved to [[broadcast television]].
