== Early life ==
Winkler was born in the West Side of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]], the son of Ilse Anna Marie Winkler (née Hadra) and Harry Irving Winkler, a [[lumber]] company president. Winkler's [[Jew]]ish parents emigrated from [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] to the [[United States]] in 1939, "on the eve" of [[World War II]]. Winkler said that his parents came to the United States for a six-month business trip but that they knew they were never going back.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 /> His father smuggled the only assets the family had left, family jewels, in a box of chocolate that he carried under his arm.<ref name=WTFMaron-2015 />

Although they did not keep kosher, Winkler was raised in the traditions of [[Conservative Judaism]],<ref name=Scotsman-ReadingTour-2009>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/welcome-to-my-world-henry-winkler-1-1352707 |title=Welcome to my world: Henry Winkler |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=JewishChronicle-Pantomime-2014>{{cite web|last=Nathan|first=John|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-features/114603/happy-days-after-hard-knocks |title=Happy days after hard knocks |work= [[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=9 January 2014 |accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> but said that he was not religious as an adult. The family attended [[Congregation Habonim]], where his mother, a homemaker, ran the [[Judaica]] shop. His parents were founding members of the temple.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 /> Winkler has a sister, Beatrice.<ref name=WTFMaron-2015>{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 593 - Henry Winkler|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_593_-_henry_winkler|website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=Audio podcast interview|date=13 April 2015}}</ref>

Growing up, because of his undiagnosed dyslexia, Winkler said he was very anxious as a child. He said he was considered to be "slow, stupid, not living up to my potential." He said his father spoke 11 languages and could do math in his head and did not understand Winkler's problems at school, where Winkler would celebrate a C. Winkler has said that his relationship with his parents (now deceased) was strained, due at least partially to their attitude towards his undiagnosed dyslexia.<ref name=YaleCenterforDyslexia>{{cite web|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/Winkler.html |title=Henry Winkler, Actor, Producer, Author |work=The Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> He stated his father referred to him as "dumb dog" and often punished him for his difficulties in school.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

Winkler attended P.S. 87 on W. 78th Street and then graduated from [[McBurney School]] in 1963, both of which were located in Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]] neighborhood.<ref name=NYDailyNews-Author-2014 /> Winkler said he did not graduate with his class because of his learning disability and problems with a geometry class, which he finally passed after attending summer school.<ref name=Guardian-Zipzer-2014 />

In 1967, Winkler received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Emerson College]]. At Emerson, he was a member of the Alpha Pi Theta Fraternity. In 1970, Winkler earned a [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[Yale School of Drama]]. In 1978, Emerson awarded Winkler an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Humane Letters|Doctorate of Humane Letters]]. Winkler has also received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from [[Austin College]].

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
Winkler said he had wanted to be an actor from the time he was a young child.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

Winkler's first job on television was on a game show in New York, where he was an extra. He said he got $10 for the role.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

After working in theater and getting fired from a play in Washington, Winkler moved to New York City and supported himself by appearing in television commercials, one year doing over 30. He was able to support himself with the commercial work so he could do theater for free at [[Manhattan Theater Club]] and not have to get a money job.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

He also appeared in episodes of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.

==== ''Happy Days'' ====
[[File:Happy days motorcycle richie fonzie 1977.JPG|right|thumb|225px|Richie ([[Ron Howard]]) takes a turn on Fonzie's motorcycle]]
Although Winkler had already shot the film, ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]],'' he was a relative unknown. In 1973, a year before that film was released, producer Tom Miller was instrumental in Winkler getting cast for the role of Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, nicknamed "The Fonz" or "[[Fonzie]]", in ''[[Happy Days]]'', which first aired in January 1974.<ref name=People-HappyDaysFonz-1976>{{cite news|last1=Armstrong|first1=Lois|title=It's The Fonz! Ayyyy—the Fonz Is a Smash, but Henry Winkler Finds Some Nightmares in His Happy Daze|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20066500,00.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=24 May 1976}}</ref>

For ''Happy Days'', director/producer [[Garry Marshall]] originally had in mind a completely opposite physical presence. Marshall sought to cast a hunky, blonde, Italian model-type male in the role of Fonzie, intended as a stupid [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the real star, [[Ron Howard]]. However, when Winkler, a [[Yale School of Drama]] graduate, interpreted the role in auditions, Marshall immediately snapped him up. According to Winkler, "The Fonz was everybody I wasn't. He was everybody I wanted to be."<ref>[http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200802/20080226/slide_20080226_350_107.jhtml Remarks to Oprah Winfrey] on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]],'' original airdate February 26, 2008</ref>

Winkler's character, though remaining very much a rough-hewn outsider, gradually became the focus of the show as time passed (in particular after the departure of Ron Howard).<ref name=DVDTalk-HappyDays-S3-2007>{{cite news|title=Happy Days - The Third Season|work= [[DVD Talk]]|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31528/happy-days-the-third-season|accessdate=16 August 2010|date=27 November 2007}}</ref> Initially, ABC executives did not want to see the Fonz wearing leather, thinking the character would appear to be a criminal. The first 13 episodes show Winkler wearing two different kinds of [[windbreaker]] jackets, one of which was green. As Winkler said in a [[TV Land]] interview, "It's hard to look cool in a green windbreaker". Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket. In the end, a compromise was made. Winkler could only wear the leather jacket in scenes with his motorcycle, and from that point on, the Fonz was never without his motorcycle until season 2. ''Happy Days'' ended its run in 1984.

==== 1970s ====
During his decade on ''Happy Days'', Winkler also starred in a number of movies, including ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'' (1974), playing a troubled [[Vietnam-American War|Vietnam veteran]] in ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' (1977), ''[[The One and Only (1978 film)|The One and Only]]'' (1978), ''[[An American Christmas Carol]]'' (TV movie, 1979) and a morgue attendant in ''[[Night Shift (film)|Night Shift]]'' (1982), which was directed by ''Happy Days'' co-star [[Ron Howard]].

That year Winkler was also narrator and executive producer of ''[[Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids?]]'', a [[documentary film]] about Dorothy and Bob DeBolt, an American couple who have [[adoption|adopted]] 14 children, some of whom are severely disabled war orphans (in addition to raising Dorothy's five biological children and Bob's biological daughter). The film won an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Best Feature-length Documentary]] in 1978,<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/54399/Who-Are-the-DeBolts-And-Where-Did-They-Get-19-Kids-/details |title=NY Times: Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids? |accessdate=2008-11-15|work=NY Times}}</ref> as well as the [[Directors Guild of America Awards 1978|Directors Guild of America Award]] and the Humanitas Award for producer and director [[John Korty]] in 1979. A 50-minute version of the film shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in December, 1978, earned a 1979 [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement - Informational Program and an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Informational Program for Winkler, Korty, and producers Warren Lockhart and Dan McCann.

Winkler was also one of the hosts of the 1979 [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].

==== 1980s ====
After ''Happy Days'' ended, Winkler concentrated on producing and directing. Within months of the program's cancellation, he and [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] had collaborated to establish '''Winkler-Rich Productions;''' whenever Rich or Ann Daniels was uninvolved, his company was called '''Fair Dinkum Productions.''' He chose the name in a nod to Australia, where the term Fair Dinkum is a national slang.  He produced several television shows including ''[[MacGyver]],'' ''[[So Weird]],'' and ''[[Mr. Sunshine (1986 TV series)|Mr. Sunshine]],'' in all of which productions he was partnered with Rich; ''[[Sightings (TV series)|Sightings]],'' in which Daniels was involved; the 1985 made-for-television film ''[[Scandal Sheet (1985 film)|Scandal Sheet]],'' for which he was [[executive producer]]; and the game shows ''Wintuition'' and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (the latter from 2002–2004, occasionally serving as a sub-announcer). He also directed several movies including the [[Billy Crystal]] movie ''[[Memories of Me]],'' (1988) and ''[[Cop and a Half]]'' (1993) with [[Burt Reynolds]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==== 1990s ====
As the 1990s began, Winkler returned to acting. In 1991 he starred in the controversial made-for-television film ''[[Absolute Strangers]],'' as a husband forced to make a decision regarding his comatose wife and his unborn baby. In 1994, he returned to TV with the short-lived comedy series ''[[Monty (TV series)|Monty]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. Also in 1994, he co-starred with [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the holiday TV movie ''[[One Christmas]].'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} He played an uncredited role as a high school principal in the 1996 movie ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). [[Adam Sandler]] asked Winkler to play a college football coach, a supporting role in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998).

==== 2000s ====
He would later appear in three other Sandler films, ''[[Little Nicky]]'' (2000) where he plays himself and is covered in bees, ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' (2006, as the main character's father), and ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008), again playing himself. He also played small roles in movies such as ''[[Down to You]]'' (2000), ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'' (2003), and ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]'' (2007).  {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Winkler had a recurring role as incompetent lawyer [[Barry Zuckerkorn]] in the [[Fox Television]] comedy ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]].'' In one episode, his character hopped over a confined shark lying on a pier, a reference to his role in the origin of the phrase, from a two-part episode of ''Happy Days,'' "[[jumping the shark]]." After that episode, Winkler, in interviews, stated that he was the only person to have "jumped the shark" twice. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

When Winkler moved to [[CBS]] for one season to star in 2005–06's ''[[Out of Practice]],'' his role as the Bluth family lawyer on ''Arrested Development'' was taken over by ''Happy Days'' co-star [[Scott Baio]] in the fall of 2005, shortly before the acclaimed but Nielsen-challenged show ceased production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Winkler has guest-starred on television series such as ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' (as Miles Lascoe, a parolee just out of jail—he was in jail for armed robbery, twice), ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Practice]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (playing a member of a biker gang—in one scene, he calls Marge "Mrs. S", a reference to Fonzie calling ''Happy Days'' matriarch Marion Cunningham "Mrs. C"), ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Third Watch]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'' and ''[[Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil]]''.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The [[Weezer]] video for 1994's "[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]" edited period footage of Henry Winkler as the Fonz, as well as a double shot from behind to create the illusion that Fonzie and other characters were watching Weezer as they performed in Arnold's restaurant. He appeared on [[KTTV]]'s ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' and in one appearance, while substituting for [[Steve Edwards (talk show host)|Steve Edwards]], Winkler reunited with fellow ''Happy Days'' cast member [[Marion Ross]]. Winkler made a cameo appearance in the band [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]]'s video for "[[Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054077/say-anything-gets-sexy-with-fonzie-begins-new-cd |title=Say Anything Gets Sexy With Fonzie, Begins New CD |publisher=Billboard |date=2007-03-09 |accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|zaOxwINr5GA}}</ref>

A close friend of actor [[John Ritter]], the two led a Broadway ensemble cast in [[Neil Simon|Neil Simon's]] ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' in 2000. Winkler was reunited as a guest star on Ritter's sitcom ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules (for Dating my Teenage Daughter)]]'' in 2003 by Ritter's request. On September 11, Ritter became ill during filming, and unexpectedly died. A stunned, grief-stricken Winkler was interviewed by [[Mary Hart (TV personality)|Mary Hart]] of ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and various other entertainment news sources.
[[File:HenryWinklerAug08.jpg|thumb|right|187px|at the 2008 [[Fan Expo Canada]]]]
In 2008, he appeared in two Christmas movies, in the Hallmark Channel movie ''[[The Most Wonderful Time of the Year (film)|The Most Wonderful Time of the Year]]'' as a retired cop who plays matchmaker between his niece and a drifter he befriends, and in ''[[Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh]]'' as the judge who orders Drake and Josh to give a young girl "the best Christmas ever" or be sent to jail. In 2009, Winkler provided the voice of Willard Deutschebog, a suicidal German teacher, in the Fox comedy series, ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (U.S. TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]].''<ref name="sdsu">{{cite web|url=http://sitdownshutupwiki.fox.com/?t=anon|title=Sit Down, Shut Up|publisher=Fox|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref>

==== 2010s ====
In the summer/fall 2010 season, Winkler joined the cast of [[Adult Swim]]'s television adaptation of [[Rob Corddry]]'s web series ''[[Childrens Hospital]],'' playing a stereotypically feckless hospital administrator.

In late September 2010, Winkler provided the voice of Professor Nathaniel Zib in the Lego Hero Factory mini-series, ''Rise of the Rookies.''

In 2011, Winkler guest starred as [[Ambush Bug]] in the series finale of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]].''

In August 2012, Winkler announced on Twitter that he would be returning to the fourth season of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hwinkler4real/status/241542660526063616 |title=Twitter / hwinkler4real: I AM SUPPOSED TO BE MEMORIZING |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref>

Winkler appeared in the film ''[[Here Comes the Boom]],'' released October 12, 2012, as the music teacher at Wilkinson High School.

He stars in the TV adaption of his book series ''[[Hank Zipzer]]'' as the teacher, Mr. Rock. Mr. Rock was based on a music teacher Winkler had in high school at [[McBurney School|McBurney]]. Winkler said that the real Mr. Rock believed in him, was the only teacher there who he felt did.<ref name=JustOneMoreBook-AudioInterview-2008>{{cite web|last1=Blevis|first1=Mark|title=Interview with Henry Winkler|url=http://justonemorebook.com/2008/01/21/interview-with-henry-winkler/|website=Just One More Book!!|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=21 January 2008}}</ref>

In March 2014, Winkler was cast in a recurring role on USA Network's ''[[Royal Pains]]'', as Hank and Evan's ne'er-do-well father Eddy.

=== Theater ===
Winkler's audition for the [[Yale School of Drama]] was a [[Shakespeare]] monologue, which he promptly forgot, so he made up his own Shakespeare monologue. Out of a class of 25 actors, 11 finished. During summers, he and his classmates opened a summer stock theater called New Haven Free Theater, putting on various plays including ''[[Woyzeck]],'' and an improv night. The company put on a production of ''The American Pig'' at the [[Joseph Papp Public Theater]] for the [[New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater|New York Shakespeare Festival]]  in New York City. In June 1970, after graduating from Yale, Winkler was asked to be part of the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] company, which included [[James Naughton]] and [[Jill Eikenberry]].<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

During his time there, [[Cliff Robertson]], who had seen him in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], wanted him to come play a part in his movie, ''[[The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid]],'' but because there was no understudy, Winkler could not audition. He left Yale Rep after a year and a half.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

In 1971, Winkler got a job at the [[Arena Stage]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to work on the play, ''[[Moonchildren]],'' but was fired by director, [[Alan Schneider]].<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

In 1977, Winkler appeared in a TV special, "Henry Winkler Meets [[William Shakespeare]]," part of the ''[[CBS]] Festival of Lively Arts for Young People'' instructional series for children. With the assistance of [[Tom Aldredge]] as Shakespeare, Winkler, as himself, introduced an audience of children to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and explained to them how Shakespeare's plays were produced at the [[Globe Theatre]] in [[London]] in the 17th century. He also played [[Romeo]] in the scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in which [[Romeo]] slays [[Tybalt]] in a sword duel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/shakespeare/index.php/title/av38217 |title=British Universities Film & Video Council: "Henry Winkler Meets William Shakespeare" |publisher=Bufvc.ac.uk |date=1977-03-20 |accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes-Stratford-1977>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A04E0D8103BE334BC4053DFB466838C669EDE|last1=Klemesrud|first1=Judy|title=From Leather Jacket to Tights: The Fonz Makes It in Stratford|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 February 1977|page=26}}</ref>

==== Pantomime ====
Winkler appeared in his first [[pantomime]] at the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]], [[London]] in 2006, playing [[Captain Hook]] in ''[[Peter Pan]],'' replacing [[David Hasselhoff]] who pulled out when he was offered a TV role by [[Simon Cowell]]. He reprised the role in [[Woking]] for Christmas 2007. For the 2008/2009 season he played [[Captain Hook]] at the [[Milton Keynes Theatre]] and donned the hook once again for the 2009/2010 panto season at the [[Liverpool Empire Theatre|Liverpool Empire]].<ref name=NYTimes-Pantomime-2009>{{cite news|last1=Lyall|first1=Sarah|title=Topsy-Turvy Christmas Foolery|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/theater/22panto.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 December 2009}}</ref>

=== Author ===
In 1998, Winkler's agent at [[Creative Artists Agency|CAA]], Alan Berger, suggested Winkler write a children's book about dyslexia, but Winkler didn't think that he would be able to write because of his struggles with the learning disability. Berger was persistent, and a few years later, in 2003, he again suggested Winker write. Winkler said yes. Berger suggested he co-write with author [[Lin Oliver]].<ref name=WTFMaron-2015 /> Winkler has since written 19 books.<ref name=HReporter-RoyalPainsSecrets-2011 />

==== Hank Zipzer books ====
Since 2003, Winkler has collaborated with [[Lin Oliver]] on a series of children's books about a 4th grade boy, [[Hank Zipzer]], who is [[dyslexic]].

Henry was the 9th King of the Bacchus, Mardi Gras, Parade in New Orleans in 1977; the theme was "Happily Ever After".

Winkler said he was named after his Uncle Helmut, who did not make it out of German during World War II.<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 /> His middle name, Franklin, was in honor of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name=EmmyTVLegends-Interview-2006 />

He is an avid [[fly fisherman]], which he often does in [[Montana]]. On the rewards of this hobby, Winker said: " The repetition of it, the sound of the water, I find it to be totally draining. Anything that bothers you is completely washed from your body. I see fly-fishing as a washing machine for your brain. My technique is still ugly as sin. But somehow I get the fish."<ref name=HReporter-RoyalPainsSecrets-2011 />
