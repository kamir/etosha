He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking "Can I have fries with that?" The paper printed it and he got an "angry letter" from the local priest; it led to "sort of a little mini-controversy" in the town.<ref name=MusicToo>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/10/17/140946967/seth-macfarlane-tvs-family-guy-makes-music-too |title=Seth MacFarlane: TV's 'Family Guy' Makes Music, Too |date=October 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Career==

===Television career===

====Hanna-Barbera years====
MacFarlane was recruited during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President [[Fred Seibert]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/nicktoons/2006/06/09/seth-macfarlane/ |title=The Nicktoons Network Animation Festival-Seth MacFarlane |publisher=Frederator Studios |date=June 9, 2006}}</ref> He went to work at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of ''The Life of Larry'', rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent.<ref name="ignint"/> He worked as an animator and writer for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/429/429628p3.html |title=An Interview with Seth MacFarlane: The creator of Family Guy discusses his career |page=3 |publisher=IGN |date=July 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref> He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an "old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', and ''[[Johnny Bravo]]''.<ref name="stlouis"/><ref>{{Cite news |title=My TV hero: Daniel Roche on Seth MacFarlane |author=Hickman, Leo |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/29/my-tv-hero-seth-macfarlane |publisher=The Guardian |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on ''Johnny Bravo''. He found it easier to develop his own style at ''Johnny Bravo'' through the show's process of scriptwriting, which ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''Cow and Chicken'', and ''I Am Weasel'' did not use.<ref name="ignint"/> As a part of the ''Johnny Bravo'' crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as [[Adam West]] and [[Jack Sheldon]] of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his ''Family Guy'' series.

He also did freelance work for [[Walt Disney Television Animation]], writing for ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', and for [[Nelvana]], where he wrote for ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on ''Ace Ventura'').<ref name="ignint"/> MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled ''[[Zoomates]]'' for [[Frederator Studios]]' ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' on [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frederatorblogs.com/channel_frederator/2006/02/25/rumor-confirmed/ |title=Rumor Confirmed |date=February 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2008}}</ref> In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to ''The Life of Larry'' entitled ''[[Larry shorts|Larry & Steve]]'', which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What-A-Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]''. Executives at Fox saw both ''Larry'' shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series.<ref name="Bartlett">{{cite web |url = http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/|title = Seth MacFarlane – he's the "Family Guy"|accessdate = December 31, 2007|last = Bartlett|first = James|date = March 12, 2007|work = greatreporter.com|publisher = Presswire Limited}}</ref>

====''Family Guy''====
{{Main|Family Guy}}
Although MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor.<ref name="ignint"/> He first pitched ''Family Guy'' to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive for Hanna-Barbera, who was trying to get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million).<ref name="ignint"/><ref name="megadeal">{{cite news|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Family Guy'' creator seals megadeal|date=May 5, 2008|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url =http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0435504220080505|accessdate = May 31, 2008}}</ref> Recalling the experience in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', MacFarlane stated, "I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot".<ref>{{cite news|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|title= The Young Guy Of 'Family Guy'; A 30-Year-Old's Cartoon Hit Makes An Unexpected Comeback|date=July 7, 2007|publisher=The New York Times Company|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/arts/young-guy-family-guy-30-year-old-s-cartoon-hit-makes-unexpected-comeback.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|work =The New York Times|page =2|accessdate = January 6, 2008}}</ref>

After six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a "very, very simply, crudely animated film – with just enough to get the tone of the show across" to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and ordered the series immediately.<ref name="ignint"/> In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of ''Family Guy'' for a January 1999 debut.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mink|last=Eric|title= Fox Fine-'Toons Its Midseason Lineup|date=July 24, 1998|publisher=|url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/07/24/1998-07-24_fox_fine-_toons_its_midseaso.html|work =[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |page =|accessdate = May 27, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ''Family Guy'' was originally intended to be a series of shorts on ''[[MADtv]]'', much in the same way ''[[The Simpsons]]'' had begun on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's ''MADtv'' connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns.<ref name="ignint"/> At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.<ref name="usatoday"/>

''Family Guy'' first aired January 31, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services/5639961-1.html|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090717064830/http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services/5639961-1.html|archivedate=2009-07-17 |title=''Family Guy'' Returns to Production with an Initial Order of 22 New Episodes to Premiere in Early 2005 |date=March 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 31, 2008 |work=Business Wire}}</ref> MacFarlane's work in animating ''Family Guy'' has been influenced by [[Jackie Gleason]] and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[All in the Family]]''.<ref name="personal">{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=McLean|title=Seth MacFarlane: ''Family Guy'', ''American Dad!''|date=June 1, 2007|publisher=Reed Business|url =http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117966166.html?nav=eproducer07|archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/65bly3WCg|archivedate =February 21, 2012|work =Variety|accessdate = January 5, 2008}}</ref> In addition to writing three episodes, "[[Death Has a Shadow]]", "[[Family Guy Viewer Mail 1]]" and "[[North by North Quahog]]", MacFarlane voices ''Family Guy''{{'}}s main male characters – [[Peter Griffin]], [[Stewie Griffin]], [[Brian Griffin]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake Tucker, and additional characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and established fan loyalty, ''Family Guy'' developed into a US$1-billion franchise.<ref name="megadeal"/> On May 4, 2008, after approximately two and a half years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a US$100-million agreement with Fox to keep ''Family Guy'' and ''American Dad!'' until 2012. The agreement makes him the world's highest paid television writer.<ref>[http://www.buddytv.com/articles/family-guy/family-guy-creator-signs-lucra-19173.aspx ''Family Guy'' Creator Signs Lucrative Deal with Fox.] BuddyTV.

MacFarlane's success with ''Family Guy'' has opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer [[Walter Murphy]] created ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]''. The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track "Stewie's Sexy Party".<ref>Spence D.

''Family Guy'' has been cancelled twice, although strong fan support and DVD sales have caused Fox to reconsider.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jesse|last=McKinley|title=Canceled and Resurrected, on the Air and Onstage|date=May 2, 2005|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/arts/television/02fami.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|work =The New York Times|accessdate = May 31, 2008}}</ref> MacFarlane mentioned how these cancellations affected the lineup of writers each time Fox approved the show. "One of the positive aspects of ''Family Guy'' constantly being pulled off [the air] is that we were always having to restaff writers".<ref name="norton"/>

During the sixth season, episodes of ''Family Guy'' and ''American Dad!'' were delayed from regular broadcast due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] (which MacFarlane participated in to support the writers while Fox aired three ''Family Guy'' episodes without MacFarlane's permission). On February 12, 2008, the strike ended,<ref name="cnn1">{{cite news|title=Strike over, Hollywood writers head back to work|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/13/writers.strike/index.html|work=CNN.com|date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=May 6, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080413003541/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/13/writers.strike/index.html |archivedate = April 13, 2008}}</ref> and the series resumed airing regularly, beginning with "[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]".

====''American Dad!''====
{{Main|American Dad!}}
MacFarlane has a second long-running, successful [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom|animated series]] in ''American Dad!'' which has been in production since early 2005. To date, ''American Dad!'' is MacFarlane's only animated series never to have suffered an official cancellation, though it did undergo a network relocation from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] on October 20, 2014, following the show's [[American Dad! (season 11)|11th season]]. TBS announced on July 16, 2013, that they had picked up the series for a 15-episode [[American Dad! (season 12)|12th season]]. Reportedly, the purpose of the network relocation was originally to make room for new animated broadcasts on Fox's now defunct "[[Animation Domination]]" lineup. It was reported that the relocation of ''American Dad!'' allowed room for other shows, such as ''[[Mulaney]]'' and another animated series from Seth MacFarlane called ''[[Bordertown (2015 TV series)|Bordertown]]''. ''Bordertown'' is slated to begin its run in the 2015–16 television season.<ref>http://www.bubbleblabber.com/bordertown-being-pushed-til-fox-fall-2015/</ref>

While MacFarlane regularly does extensive [[voice acting]] work for ''American Dad!'', he has left much of the show's [[creative direction]] up to Weitzman and Barker. MacFarlane has credited this move with helping to give the series its own distinct voice and identity.<ref name="doorly1">{{cite web|author=Sean Doorly |url=http://www.doorly.com/writing/seth-macfarlane.htm |title=Seth MacFarlane Interview |publisher=Doorly.com |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> Though, as announced on November 4, 2013, Barker departed ''American Dad!'' after 10 seasons of serving as the show's producer/co-[[showrunner]], resulting from creative differences as production for season 11 on TBS commenced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/american-dad-executive-producerco-showrunner-mike-barker-exits/ |title='American Dad' Executive Producer/Co-Showrunner Mike Barker Exits |publisher=Deadline.com |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=May 11, 2013, 8:44 am EST |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/05/american-dad-shakeup_n_4218021.html |title='American Dad' Shakeup: Co-Creator Leaving Before TBS Move |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> ''American Dad!'' was first shown after [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], debuting with the episode "[[Pilot (American Dad!)|Pilot]]."

Because of atypical scheduling of the show's [[American Dad! (season 1)|first 7 episodes]], ''American Dad!'' has a controversial [[American Dad!#Season number discrepancies and episode misreports|season number discrepancy]] in which many are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between ''American Dad!'' creators and the show's official website—both from its original [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] website and now from TBS website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/americandad/recaps/season-9/episode-19 |title=FOX Broadcasting Company – American Dad TV Show – American Dad TV Series – American Dad Episode Guide |publisher=Fox.com |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref name="by Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012">{{cite web|author=Todd VanDerWerff |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/comedy-showrunners-week-american-dads-cocreators-o,85507/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: American Dad’s co-creators on the show’s weird evolution &#124; TV &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

What with Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear if any of these plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.

MacFarlane has described the initial seasons of ''American Dad!'' as being similar to ''[[All in the Family]]'', likening [[title role|title character]] [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]]'s originally [[bigotry|bigoted]] persona to [[Archie Bunker]].<ref name="norton">Norton James.[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20071229222114/http://www.flakmag.com/features/macfarlane.html "Seth MacFarlane's Third Act"].

His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed to being a huge ''American Dad!'' fan himself. He has taken note of the increasing fondness and excitement over the "[[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]]" character from fans via his Twitter.<ref name="by Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012"/>

The show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the insanely drastic, endangering, [[wikt: dog-eat-dog|dog-eat-dog]], rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family's [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]], he works as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show known for its [[story arc]] elements and other [[American Dad!#Plot techniques|distinguishing plot techniques]]); Stan's [[wikt: paradox|paradoxically]] moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, [[Francine Smith|Francine]]; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley]] and nerdy son [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve]]. Accompanied with the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which are [[non-human]] species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]], who's [[Roger (American Dad!)#Disguises and alter egos|full of disguises/alter ego]]s and has few if any limits on his behaviors. He was rescued by Stan from [[Area 51]]; [[Klaus Heissler|Klaus]], the man-in-a-fish-body pet. Klaus's unenviable situation came about from a brain of an East German [[Olympics|Olympic]] skier being shrunk and transplanted into a fish body; and [[Jeff Fischer (American Dad!)|Jeff Fischer]], Hayley's boyfriend turned "whipped" husband, known for his infatuation with Hayley's mom, Francine.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alexandria|last=Stanley|title=Dad Is a C.I.A.

====''The Cleveland Show''====
{{Main|The Cleveland Show}}

"They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help. ... [They teach you to] show your teeth. If you look at old photos of Sinatra while he's singing, there's a lot of very exposed teeth.

====Gay rights support====

A man with gray hair, looking straight forward, and wearing suit, sits behind him.|MacFarlane speaking at a ceremony for [[Bill Maher]] to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in September 2010]]
MacFarlane is passionate about his support for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]]. He said it is "infuriating and idiotic" that two gay partners "have to go through this fucking [[Dog and pony show|dog and pony act]] when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" He went on to say, "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time".<ref name=Advocate>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2008/01/25/bgf-seth-macfarlane|title=BGF: Seth MacFarlane|publisher=Advocate|author=Voss, Brandon|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}</ref> MacFarlane continued, "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?"<ref name=Advocate/>

MacFarlane, in recognition of "his active, passionate commitment to [[humanism|humanist]] values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues", was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=166:seth-macfarlane-harvard-humanist-of-the-year-2011&catid=6:latest-news&Itemid=38|work=Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard|title=Seth MacFarlane, Harvard Humanist of the Year 2011!|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}</ref>

Despite his supportive position on gay rights, MacFarlane was criticized for his portrayal of [[transsexualism]] in the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Quagmire's Dad]]". Gay novelist [[Brent Hartinger]] found the episode's inclusion of [[transphobia|transphobic]] remarks from Peter and [[Lois Griffin]] — as well as a scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be [[Glenn Quagmire]]'s father – to be "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, "Frankly, it's literally ''impossible'' for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I come to the conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot".<ref name="aeidiot">{{cite web | author = Hartinger, Brent|title = Is Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane a Complete Idiot? | publisher = AfterElton.com | date =May 10, 2010| url = http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2010/5/seth-macfarlane-complete-idiot| accessdate =May 10, 2010}}</ref> The [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" about the episode.<ref>{{cite web| author = Rosales, Jonathan| title = GLAAD Shares Community Concerns About Last Night's Family Guy| publisher = [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] | date =May 10, 2010| url = http://glaadblog.org/2010/05/10/glaad-shares-community-concerns-about-last-nights-family-guy/| accessdate =May 10, 2010}}</ref> MacFarlane said he was "surprised" by the negative reaction to "Quagmire's Dad", saying that "it seemed that [gay commentators] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, "Look, Brian happens to be a [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a [[vagina]] and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"<ref>Amy Wallace (2010-08).

===Lawsuits===
On October 3, 2007, [[Bourne Co.

Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of their music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, [[20th Century Fox Film Corporation|20th Century Fox Film Corp.]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting Co.]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Walter Murphy]]; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Bourne Co., vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc., Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc., The Cartoon Network, Inc., Seth MacFarlane, Walter Murphy |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court, Southern District of New York]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2010|url=http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/family%20guy%20complaint.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Bourne argued that "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in ''[[Campbell v.

In December 2007, ''Family Guy'' was again accused of copyright infringement when actor [[Art Metrano]] filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature "magic" act involving absurd "faux" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |title=Magician sues over cartoon Jesus |work=Chortle |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}</ref> MacFarlane, [[20th Century Fox]], [[Steve Callaghan]], and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Arthur Metrano, vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Seth MacFarlane, Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein |court=[[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] |accessdate=April 27, 2010|date=December 5, 2007|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1206_metrano_fox_wm.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—"purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work", and "amount and substantiality of the taking"—counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth—"economic impact"—had to await more fact-finding.
