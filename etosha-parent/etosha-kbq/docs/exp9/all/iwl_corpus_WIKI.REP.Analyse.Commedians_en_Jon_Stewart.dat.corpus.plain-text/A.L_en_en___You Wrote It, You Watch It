'''''You Wrote It, You Watch It''''' is a short-lived [[MTV]] [[sketch comedy]] series starring members of [[The State (TV series)|The State]] comedy troupe before they were given their own show by the network. It was hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], future host of [[The Daily Show]]. 

The comedians performed humorous sketch recreations of letters sent to the MTV offices by viewers, depicting outrageous stories and events from their daily lives, with introductions by Stewart.

An early example of [[crowdsourcing]], the show only lasted one season, premiering in [[1992 in television|1992]] and being canceled in [[1993 in television|1993]]. Jon Stewart would later quip, "You wrote it, you just didn't watch it!"
