'''Walter Leland Cronkite, Jr.''' (November 4, 1916&nbsp;– July 17, 2009) was an American [[Broadcast journalism|broadcast journalist]], best known as [[anchorman]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' for 19 years (1962–81). During the heyday of [[CBS News]] in the 1960s and 1970s, he was often cited as "the most trusted man in America" after being so named in an opinion poll.<ref name=OTM>{{cite interview|subject=[[Ben Zimmer]]|interviewer=[[Bob Garfield]]|title=Too Good to Check|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2009/07/31/07|format=audio/transcript|program=''[[On the Media]]''|callsign=[[NPR]]|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS at 75 Timeline&nbsp;— The 1950s|url=http://www.cbs.com/specials/cbs_75/timeline/1950.shtml|accessdate=April 26, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Jeff Scott|title=The elements of speechwriting and public speaking|publisher=Macmillan|year=1989|page=171|isbn=0-02-527791-X}}</ref> He reported many events from 1937 to 1981, including bombings in [[World War II]]; the [[Nuremberg trials]]; combat in the [[Vietnam War]];<ref name="Philly" /> [[Watergate]]; the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]]; and the assassinations of [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]], civil rights pioneer [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[The Beatles|Beatles]] musician [[Death of John Lennon|John Lennon]]. He was also known for his extensive coverage of the U.S. space program, from [[Project Mercury]] to the [[Apollo program|Moon landings]] to the [[Space Shuttle]]. He was the only non-NASA recipient of a Moon-rock award. Cronkite is well known for his departing catchphrase "And that's the way it is," followed by the date on which the appearance aired.

=== Early years at CBS ===
In 1950, Cronkite joined CBS News in its young and growing television division, again recruited by Murrow. Cronkite began working at WTOP-TV, the CBS affiliate in Washington, D.C.. He originally served as anchor of the network's 15-minute late-Sunday-evening newscast ''Up To the Minute'', which followed ''[[What's My Line?]]'' at 11:00&nbsp;pm ET from 1951 through 1962.

Although it was widely reported that the term "[[News presenter#News anchors|anchor]]" was coined to describe Cronkite's role at both the [[1952 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[1952 Republican National Convention|Republican]] National Conventions, marking the first nationally televised convention coverage, other news presenters bore the title before him.<ref name=OTM /> Cronkite anchored the network's coverage of the [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]] as well as later conventions. In 1964 he was temporarily replaced by the team of [[Robert Trout]] and [[Roger Mudd]]; this proved to be a mistake, and Cronkite returned to the anchor chair for future political conventions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

From 1953 to 1957, Cronkite hosted the CBS program ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]'', which reenacted historical events, using the format of a news report.<ref name="KTVN Channel 2" /> His famous last line for these programs was: "What sort of day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times ... and you were there." In 1971, the show was revived and redesigned to attract an audience of teenagers and young adults on Saturday mornings. He also hosted ''The Twentieth Century'', a documentary series about important historical events of the century comprised almost exclusively of [[newsreel]] footage and interviews. It became a long-running hit (it was renamed ''[[The 21st Century (TV series)|The 21st Century]]'' in 1967). Cronkite also hosted ''It's News to Me'', a game show based on news events.<ref name="NY times" />

Another of his network assignments was ''The Morning Show'', CBS' short-lived challenge to [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1954.<ref name="CBS Trusted" /> His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion [[puppet]] named Charlemane about the news.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cronkite with Charlemane the Lion on CBS' ''The Morning Show'' (photograph)|work=CBS News|date=June 23, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/06/23/in_depth_showbiz/photoessay559943_1_9_photo.shtml?tag=page Walter|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> He considered this discourse with a puppet as "one of the highlights" of the show. He added, "A puppet can render opinions on people and things that a human commentator would not feel free to utter.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], the show's [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], by [[grammar|grammatically]] correcting its advertising [[slogan]].

He was the lead broadcaster of the network's coverage of the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], the first-ever time such an event was televised in the United States. He replaced [[Jim McKay]], who had suffered a [[mental breakdown]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/sports/19sandomir.html?ref=sports|author=Sandomir, Richard|title=Amid Blizzard, Cronkite Helped Make Sports History|work=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref>

=== ''The CBS Evening News'' ===
On April 16, 1962, Cronkite succeeded [[Douglas Edwards]] as anchorman of the ''CBS Evening News'' (initially ''Walter Cronkite with the News''), a job in which he became an American icon.<ref name="kansas" /> The program expanded from 15 to 30 minutes on September 2, 1963, making Cronkite the anchor of American network television's first nightly half-hour news program.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

During the early part of his tenure anchoring the ''CBS Evening News'', Cronkite competed against [[NBC]]'s anchor team of [[Chet Huntley]] and [[David Brinkley]], who anchored the ''[[Huntley-Brinkley Report]]''. For most of the 1960s, the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'' had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. This began to change in the late 1960s, as [[RCA]] made a corporate decision not to fund [[NBC News]] at the levels CBS funded CBS News. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in its broadcast journalism. This reputation meshed nicely with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the ''CBS Evening News'' began to surpass ''The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' in viewership during the summer months.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In 1969, during the [[Apollo 11]] (with co-host and former astronaut [[Wally Schirra]]) and [[Apollo 13]] moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions.<ref name="Barron" /> In 1970, when Huntley retired, the ''CBS Evening News'' finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist [[John Chancellor]], Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981.<ref name="kansas" />

One of Cronkite's trademarks was ending the ''CBS Evening News'' with the phrase "...And that's the way it is," followed by the date.<ref name="KTVN Channel 2" /> Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary.<ref name="kansas" /> Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the [[Iran hostage crisis]], Cronkite added the length of the hostages' captivity to the show's closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981.<ref>''CBS News Transcripts, January 16, 1980''.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051403597.html|title=And That's the Way It Is – Or Is It?|last=Goodman|first=Ellen|date=June 17, 1980|work=Washington Post|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

===Kennedy assassination===
{{refimprove|date=March 2010}}
[[File:Cronkitejfkdeath.gif|thumb|right|Cronkite announcing the death of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963]]

Cronkite is vividly remembered for breaking the news of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|death of President John F. Kennedy]] on Friday, November 22, 1963. Cronkite had been standing at the [[United Press International]] wire machine in the CBS newsroom as the bulletin of the President's shooting broke and he clamored to get on the air to break the news. But no camera was available for Cronkite to use and the network had to improvise in order to report the story.<ref>{{cite book

While the news was breaking, CBS was ten minutes into its live broadcast of the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]] (ATWT)'', which had begun at the very minute of the shooting. A "CBS News Bulletin" bumper slide abruptly broke into the broadcast at 1:40&nbsp;pm EST. Over the slide, Cronkite began reading what would be the first of three audio-only bulletins that were filed in the next twenty minutes:<ref>{{cite book

{{cquote|Here is a bulletin from CBS News. In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.<ref name="Cronkite Broadcasts">{{cite web

While Cronkite was reading this bulletin, a second one arrived, mentioning the severity of Kennedy's wounds:

{{cquote|...President Kennedy shot today just as his motorcade left downtown Dallas. [[Jacqueline Kennedy|Mrs. Kennedy]] jumped up and grabbed Mr. Kennedy, she called "Oh no!," the motorcade sped on. United Press [International] says that the wounds for President Kennedy perhaps could be fatal. Repeating, a bulletin from CBS News: President Kennedy has been shot by a would-be assassin in Dallas, Texas. Stay tuned to CBS News for further details.<ref name="Cronkite Broadcasts" />}}

Just before the bulletin cut out, a CBS News staffer was heard saying "Connally too," apparently having just heard the news that Texas Governor [[John Connally]] had also been shot while riding in the Presidential limousine with his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]] and Mr. and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Mrs. Kennedy]].

CBS then rejoined the telecast of ''ATWT'' during a commercial break. Just as ''ATWT'' was set to return from break, CBS News broke in with the bumper slide a second time. This bulletin saw Cronkite report in greater detail about the assassination attempt on the President, while also breaking the news of Governor Connally's shooting.

{{cquote|...President Kennedy was shot as he drove from Dallas Airport to downtown Dallas; Governor Connally of Texas, in the car with him, was also shot. It is reported that three bullets rang out. A Secret Service man has been...was heard to shout from the car, "He's dead." Whether he referred to President Kennedy or not is not yet known. The President, cradled in the arms of his wife Mrs. Kennedy, was carried to an ambulance and the car rushed to [[Parkland Hospital]] outside Dallas, the President was taken to an emergency room in the hospital. Other White House officials were in doubt in the corridors of the hospital as to the condition of President Kennedy. Repeating this bulletin: President Kennedy shot while driving in an open car from the airport in Dallas, Texas, to downtown Dallas.<ref name="Cronkite Broadcasts" />}}

Cronkite then recapped the events as they had happened: that the President and Governor Connally had been shot and were in the emergency room at Parkland Hospital, and no one knew their condition as yet. CBS then decided to return to ''ATWT'', which was now midway through its second segment.

The cast had continued to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ''ATWT'' then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break would be the last anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. Once again, Cronkite filed an audio-only report. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy had been shot in the head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition.

At 2:00 EST, Cronkite told the viewers that CBS would be taking a station identification break so that affiliates could join the network. Within twenty seconds, all the CBS affiliates (with the exception of [[KDFW|KRLD]] in Dallas, which was covering the tragedy locally) joined the network's coverage. Cronkite appeared on-air in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. The broadcast cut into the Dallas Trade Mart meeting, which the President had been due to attend, with Eddie Barker, KRLD's news director, hearing from a fellow-reporter that Kennedy was in very critical condition. After a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that President Kennedy had died from his wounds.

After several minutes, Cronkite reported that the President had been given blood transfusions and two priests had been called into the room. He also played an audio report that someone had been arrested in the assassination attempt at the [[Texas School Book Depository]]. Barker repeated another unconfirmed statement that Kennedy was dead, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Barker then announced that the report was confirmed, but had to retract this.

CBS cut back to Cronkite reporting that one of the priests had administered last rites to the president, but not confirming Barker’s premature claim. In the next few minutes, several more bulletins of the president’s death came in, including one from CBS's own correspondent Dan Rather, with Cronkite having to announce each time that these were not officially confirmed. Yet having already received three such reports, his manner showed unmistakably that he tended to believe them.

At 2:38 pm EST, while filling in time with some observations about the security presence in Dallas, Cronkite was handed a new bulletin. After looking it over for a moment, he took off his glasses, and made the official announcement:

{{cquote|From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: (reading AP flash) "President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time." (glancing up at clock) 2&nbsp;o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.<ref name="Grzanich">{{cite web

|accessdate=August 2, 2012
}}</ref>}}

After making that announcement, Cronkite paused briefly, put his glasses back on, and swallowed hard to maintain his composure. With noticeable emotion in his voice he intoned the next sentence of the news report:<ref name="Grzanich" />
{{cquote|[[Lyndon B. Johnson|Vice President Johnson]]'' (clears throat) ''has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded; presumably he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the ''36th'' President of the United States.<ref name="Grzanich" />}}

With emotion still in his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again recapped the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining the significance of the pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in (which had occurred just as Cronkite received the bulletin confirming the President's death), that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, and that there was no report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then left the newsroom.

At about 3:30&nbsp;pm EST, Cronkite returned to the anchor position, this time in his jacket. The new details included the swearing-in ceremony of the new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, the arrest of the accused assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].  After having been relieved by his fellow reporters, he reappeared to anchor the CBS Evening News.  For the next three days, along with his colleagues, Cronkite continued to report segments of uninterrupted coverage of the assassination, including the announcement of Oswald's death on Sunday.  The next day, on the day of the funeral, Cronkite concluded the CBS Evening News with the following assessment about the events of the last four dark days:

{{cquote|It is said that the human mind has a greater capacity for remembering the pleasant than the unpleasant. But today was a day that will live in memory and in grief. Only history can write the importance of this day: Were these dark days the harbingers of even blacker ones to come, or like the black before the dawn shall they lead to some still as yet indiscernible sunrise of understanding among men, that violent words, no matter what their origin or motivation, can lead only to violent deeds? This is the larger question that will be answered, in part, in the manner that a shaken civilization seeks the answers to the immediate question: Who, and most importantly what, was Lee Harvey Oswald? The world’s doubts must be put to rest. Tonight there will be few Americans who will go to bed without carrying with them the sense that somehow they have failed. If in the search of our conscience we find a new dedication to the American concepts that brook no political, sectional, religious or racial divisions, then maybe it may yet be possible to say that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not die in vain. That’s the way it is, Monday, November 25, 1963. This is Walter Cronkite, good night.<ref name="Cronkite Broadcasts" />}}

Referring to his coverage of Kennedy's assassination, in a 2006 TV interview with [[Nick Clooney]], Cronkite recalled:
<blockquote>"I choked up, I really had a little trouble...my eyes got a little wet...[what Kennedy had represented] was just all lost to us. Fortunately, I grabbed hold before I was actually <nowiki>[crying]</nowiki>."<ref name="anchor">{{cite web

In a 2003 CBS special commemorating the 40th anniversary of the assassination, Cronkite recalled his reaction upon having the death confirmed to him, he said:

=== Vietnam War ===
[[File:Walter Cronkite In Vietnam2.jpg|thumb|120px|upright|Cronkite reported on location during the Vietnam War.]]
In mid-February 1968, on the urging of his executive producer [[Ernest Leiser]], Cronkite and Leiser journeyed to Vietnam to cover the aftermath of the [[Tet Offensive]]. They were invited to dine with General [[Creighton Abrams]], the current commander of all forces in Vietnam, whom Cronkite knew from World War II. According to Leiser, Abrams told Cronkite, "we cannot win this Goddamned war, and we ought to find a dignified way out."<ref name="Cronkite Tet">{{Cite news

Upon return, Cronkite and Leiser wrote separate editorial reports based on that trip. Cronkite, an excellent writer, preferred Leiser's text over his own.<ref name="Cronkite Tet" />
On February 27, 1968, Cronkite closed "Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?" with that editorial report:

{{quote|We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders, both in Vietnam and Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds. They may be right, that Hanoi's winter-spring offensive has been forced by the Communist realization that they could not win the longer war of attrition, and that the Communists hope that any success in the offensive will improve their position for eventual negotiations. It would improve their position, and it would also require our realization, that we should have had all along, that any negotiations must be that – negotiations, not the dictation of peace terms. For it seems now more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate. This summer's almost certain standoff will either end in real give-and-take negotiations or terrible escalation; and for every means we have to escalate, the enemy can match us, and that applies to invasion of the North, the use of nuclear weapons, or the mere commitment of one hundred, or two hundred, or three hundred thousand more American troops to the battle. And with each escalation, the world comes closer to the brink of cosmic disaster.

To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion. On the off chance that military and political analysts are right, in the next few months we must test the enemy's intentions, in case this is indeed his last big gasp before negotiations. But it is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who, What, When, Where, Why: Report from Vietnam by Walter Cronkite,|date=February 27, 1968|publisher=[[CBS Evening News]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn4w-ud-TyE|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}</ref>

Cronkite is also remembered for his coverage of the United States space program, and at times was visibly enthusiastic, rubbing his hands together on camera with a smile and uttering, "Whew...boy" on July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission put the first men on the [[Moon]]. Cronkite later criticized himself for being at a loss for journalistic words at that moment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

According to the 2006 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary on Cronkite, there was "nothing new" in his reports on the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] affair;<ref name="Philly" /> however, Cronkite brought together a wide range of reporting, and his credibility and status is credited by many with pushing the Watergate story to the forefront with the American public, ultimately resulting in the resignation of President [[Richard M.

</ref> At approximately 6:38&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], while a pre-recorded report on the Vietnam peace talks in Paris that were reported as having been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera from [[Tom Johnson (journalist)|Tom Johnson]], who was the spokesman for former President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and who at the time was also in charge of [[KTBC]], [[Austin, Texas]]' then-CBS affiliate which the former President owned. During the course of the conversation, the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.

{{cquote|I'm talking to Tom Johnson, the press secretary for Lyndon Johnson, who has reported that the thirty-sixth President of the United States died this afternoon in a...ambulance plane on the way to San Antonio, where he was taken after being stricken at his ranch- the LBJ Ranch, in Johnson City, Texas.

During the final ten minutes of that broadcast, Cronkite reported on the death, giving a retrospective on the life of nation's 36th president, and announced that CBS would air a special on Lyndon Johnson later that evening. This story was re-told on a 2007 CBS-TV special honoring Cronkite's 90th birthday. Tom Johnson later became president of [[CNN]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[NBC]]-TV's [[Garrick Utley]], anchoring ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' that evening, also interrupted his newscast in order to break the story, doing so about three minutes after Cronkite on CBS. The news was not reported on that night's ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC Evening News]]'', which was anchored by [[Howard K. Smith]] and [[Harry Reasoner]], because ABC at the time fed their newscast live at 6:00 pm Eastern instead of 6:30 to get a head start on CBS and NBC for those stations that aired ''ABC Evening News'' live (although not every affiliate did) <!--<ref>{{cite web

=== Reporting ===
As he had promised on his last show as anchor in 1981, Cronkite continued to broadcast occasionally as a special correspondent for [[CBS]], [[CNN]], and [[NPR]] into the 21st century; one such occasion was Cronkite anchoring the second space flight by [[John Glenn]] in 1998 as he had Glenn's first in 1962. In 1983, he reported on the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|British General Election]] for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] series ''[[World In Action]]'', interviewing, among many others, the victorious Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>{{cite web

In 1998, Cronkite hosted the 90-minute documentary, ''Silicon Valley: A 100 Year Renaissance'', produced by the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association. The film documented Silicon Valley's rise from the origin of [[Stanford University]] to the current high-technology powerhouse. The documentary was broadcast on PBS throughout the United States and in 26 countries. Prior to 2004, he could also be seen in the opening movie 'Back to Neverland' shown in the [[Walt Disney World]] attraction, ''[[The Magic of Disney Animation]]'', interviewing [[Robin Williams]] as if he is still on the [[CBS News]] channel, ending his on-camera time with his famous catchphrase. In the featurette, Cronkite describes the steps taken in the creation of an animated film, while Robin Williams becomes an animated character (and even becomes Walter Cronkite, impersonating his voice). He also was shown inviting Disney guests and tourists to the Disney Classics Theater.

On May 21, 1999, Walter Cronkite participated in a panel discussion on Integrity in the Media with [[Ben Bradlee]] and [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]] at the [[Connecticut Forum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Cronkite provided a particularly funny anecdote about taking a picture from a house in [[Houston, Texas]] where a newsworthy event occurred and being praised for getting a unique photograph, only to find out later that the city desk had provided him with the wrong address.<ref>{{cite web

He provided the pivotal voice of Captain Neweyes in the 1993 animated film ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story]]'', delivering his trademark line at the end. In 1995, he made an appearance on Broadway, providing the voice of the titular book in the 1995 revival of ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Cronkite was a finalist for NASA's Journalist in Space program, which mirrored the [[Teacher in Space Project]], an opportunity that was suspended after the [[Challenger disaster]] in 1986. He recorded voice-overs for the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', modifying the script he was given to make it more "Cronkitian." In 2002, Cronkite was the voice of [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the educational television cartoon ''[[Liberty's Kids]]'', which included a news segment ending with the same phrase he did back on the ''CBS Evening News''. His distinctive voice provided the narration for the television ads of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], his alma mater, with its 'We're Texas' ad campaign.<ref>{{cite web

Prior to his death, "Uncle Walter" hosted a number of TV specials and was featured in interviews about the times and events that occurred during his career as America's "most trusted" man.<ref name="Philly" /> In July 2006, the 90-minute documentary ''Walter Cronkite: Witness to History'' aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. The special was narrated by [[Katie Couric]], who assumed the ''CBS Evening News'' anchor chair in September 2006. Cronkite provided the voiceover introduction to Couric's ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', which began on September 5, 2006. Cronkite's voiceover was notably not used on introducing the broadcast reporting his funeral – no voiceover was used on this occasion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== TV and movie appearances ===
Cronkite made a cameo appearance on a 1974 episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', in which he met with [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]] in his office. [[Ted Baxter]], who at first tried to convince Cronkite that he (Baxter) was as good a newsman as [[Eric Sevareid]], pleaded with Cronkite to hire him for the network news, at least to give sport scores, and gave an example: "The [[Minnesota North Stars|North Stars]] 3, the [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]] Oh!" Cronkite turned to Grant and said, "I'm gonna get you for this!" Cronkite later said that he was disappointed that his scene was filmed in one take, since he had hoped to sit down and chat with the cast.

In the late 1980s and again in the 1990s, Cronkite appeared on the news-oriented situation comedy ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' as himself. Both episodes were written by the Emmy-award winning team of Tom Seeley and Norm Gunzenhauser. In 1991 he hosted on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] the TV documentary ''Dinosaur!'',<ref>{{YouTube|kxcx8s0OYnY|'Dinosaur!', with Walter Cronkite}}</ref> not related to the documentary [[Dinosaur!|of the same title]] hosted by [[Christopher Reeve]] on CBS six years earlier. In 1995, he narrated the [[World Liberty Concert]] held in the Netherlands.

Cronkite appeared briefly in the 2005 dramatic documentary ''[[The American Ruling Class]]'' written by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]], ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'', reporting on the [[Cuban missile crisis]] and provided the opening synopsis of the American Space Program leading to the events in [[Apollo 13]] for the [[Ron Howard]] [[Apollo 13 (film)|film of the same name]].

In 1998, he supported President [[Bill Clinton]] during Clinton's [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment trial]]. He was also a proponent of limited [[world government]] on the American federalist model, writing fund-raising letters for the World Federalist Association (now [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]). In accepting the 1999 Norman Cousins Global Governance Award at the ceremony at the United Nations, Cronkite said:

: ''"It seems to many of us that if we are to avoid the eventual catastrophic world conflict we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward a world government patterned after our own government with a legislature, executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its international laws and keep the peace. To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of faith in the new order. But the American colonies did it once and brought forth one of the most nearly perfect unions the world has ever seen."''<ref name=cousins /><ref name=speechvideo /><ref>{{cite book

Cronkite contrasted his support for accountable global government with the opposition to it by politically active Christian fundamentalists in the United States:

: ''"Even as with the American rejection of the League of Nations, our failure to live up to our obligations to the United Nations is led by a handful of willful senators who choose to pursue their narrow, selfish political objectives at the cost of our nation’s conscience. They pander to and are supported by the Christian Coalition and the rest of the religious right wing. Their leader, [[Pat Robertson]], has written that we should have a world government but only when the messiah arrives. Any attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the Devil! Well join me... I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan."''<ref name=cousins>{{cite web

In 2003, Cronkite, who owned property on [[Martha's Vineyard]], became involved in a long-running debate over his opposition to the construction of a [[wind farm]] in that area. In his column, he repeatedly condemned President [[George W. Bush]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Cronkite appeared in the 2004 [[Robert Greenwald]] film ''[[Outfoxed]]'', where he offered commentary on what he said were unethical and overtly political practices at the [[Fox News Channel]]. Cronkite remarked that when Fox News was founded by [[Rupert Murdoch]], ''"it was intended to be a conservative organization – beyond that; a [[Far right|far-right-wing]] organization"''. In January 2006, during a press conference to promote the PBS documentary about his career, Cronkite said that he felt the same way about America's presence in Iraq as he had about their presence in Vietnam in 1968 and that he felt America should recall its troops.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/01/15/entertainment/e154744S99.DTL&feed=rss.news|title=Cronkite: Time for U.S. to Leave Iraq|accessdate=April 26, 2006|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081002142916/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/01/15/entertainment/e154744S99.DTL&feed=rss.news |archivedate = October 2, 2008}}</ref>

Powers|Bill Powers]], president of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and it became part of the collection at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. Carleton said at this occasion, "We are deeply honored by Walter Cronkite’s decision to entrust this prestigious award to the Center for American History. The Center already serves as the proud steward of his professional and personal papers, which include his coverage of the space program for CBS News. It is especially fitting that the archive documenting Walter's distinguished career should also include one of the Moon rocks that the heroic astronauts of the Apollo program brought to Earth."<ref name="papers" /><ref>{{cite web
