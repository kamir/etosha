'''Morton Lyon''' "'''Mort'''" '''Sahl''' (born May 11, 1927) is a Canadian-born American [[comedian]] and [[actor]], widely considered the first modern stand-up comedian. He was the first comedian to dress casually and speak about current events in a matter-of-fact style.  He helped to get Lenny Bruce some gigs at the [[hungry i]], and occasionally wrote jokes for speeches delivered by President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name=freshair>{{cite interview |last=Sahl |first=Mort |interviewer=[[Terry Gross]] |title=Fresh Air |program=[[National Public Radio]] |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1567557 |date=23 December 2003 |quote=He wrote jokes for JFK and appeared on What's My Line? and The Ed Sullivan Show. In addition, he was the first comic to make a live recording, the first to do college concerts and, in 1960, the first to grace the cover of Time magazine. |accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=master/> Sahl got deeply involved in the post-Warren Commission investigation of Kennedy's death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sahl was born on May 11, 1927 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.<ref name=master/> His father, Harry Sahl, was a court reporter who met his wife when she responded to an advertisement he took out in a poetry magazine.<ref name=freshair/> The family moved to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] and Mort joined the [[ROTC]] unit at [[Belmont High School (Los Angeles, California)|Belmont High School]]. He was also on the staff of the school's newspaper, the ''Belmont Sentinel''. Actor [[Richard Crenna]] was one of his classmates.

After high school, in 1945, Sahl enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] and was stationed in [[Alaska]].<ref name=freshair/> In 1950, he graduated from the [[University of Southern California]] with majors in [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] and [[city management]].<ref name=master/> In a speech given at Claremont McKenna's Athenaeum in 2008, Sahl claimed to have attended West Point. He then began performing [[stand-up comedy]] at [[Enrico Banducci]]'s [[hungry i]] nightclub in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=master/>

===Career===
In 1976, Sahl wrote an autobiography called ''Heartland''. It is a bitter account of his rise in comedy, his obsession with the Kennedy assassination, his decline in show business, and his longtime friendship with [[Hugh Hefner]].  In 1979 he briefly hosted an afternoon talk show on [[WTEM|WRC Radio]], in [[Washington, D.C.]]

During the 1980s, Sahl made many jokes critical of his old friend, [[Ronald Reagan]] ("[[George Washington|Washington]] couldn't tell a lie, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] couldn't tell the truth, and Reagan can't tell the difference!"). Sahl and his wife were invited to the [[White House]] by [[Nancy Reagan]], where President Reagan [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] him at a White House tribute in front of many other top comedians. Sahl said to television interviewer [[Charlie Rose]] of the Reagans, "They are very, very forgiving."

In the late 1980s, his comedy featurette "In Spite Of The News" was heard on the Mutual Broadcasting System.

===Political activism===
Following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963, Sahl's interest in who was behind it was so great that he became a [[Sheriff|deputized member]] of New Orleans District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]]'s team to investigate the murder.<ref name=master/> As a result, Sahl's comedy began to reflect his politics and included readings and commentary on the [[Warren Commission]] Report. His earlier anti-Kennedy jokes and his onstage tirades against the Warren Commission alienated much of his audience. He was effectively [[blacklisting|blacklisted]] and his shows were cancelled. Sahl's income dropped from US$1 million to US$19,000 a year. (According to the Inflation Calculator of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $19,000 in 1964 was the equivalent of ${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|19000|1964|r=-3}}}} today.) However, the rising tide of [[counterculture]] fueled his comeback.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], Sahl was the most prominent supporter of unsuccessful candidate [[Alexander Haig]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Silverstein |authorlink=Ken Silverstein |title=Alexander Haig's Last Years |url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1999/09/alexander-haig-still-in-control |quote=It was not an auspicious debut: The most influential person to endorse him was political comedian Mort Sahl. |journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=September–October 1999 |issn=0362-8841}}</ref>

===Comedy style===
Sahl's humor has always been based on current events, especially politics.  He broke new ground in the late 1950s and early 1960s by looking to the day's [[newspaper]] headlines for many of his [[monologues]], rather than relying on one-liners.  His trademark is to appear on stage with a newspaper in hand, casually dressed in a [[V-neck sweater]].<ref name=master>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/mort-sahl/about-mort-sahl/694/ |title=About Mort Sahl |quote=In his trademark V-neck sweater, with the day's newspaper tucked under his arm, Mort Sahl has satirized—and entertained—presidents from Eisenhower to Clinton. |date=19 March 2006 |work=[[American Masters]]}}</ref>  In 1960 he was dubbed "[[Will Rogers]] with fangs" by Time magazine.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826502,00.html |title=Comedians: Will Rogers with Fangs |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 July 1960 |issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

When [[John F. Kennedy]], a personal friend, became President, Sahl began making jokes that were critical of Kennedy's policies. Television host [[Ed Sullivan]] refused to let Sahl tell any Kennedy jokes on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which meant Sahl was seldom seen on TV during the next few years.

===Personal life===
Sahl was married to [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmate]] [[China Lee]] from 1967 until their divorce in 1991.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.marinij.com/general-news/20100809/mort-sahl-improvising-a-new-life |title=Mort Sahl: Improvising a new life |first=Paul |last=Liberatore |newspaper=[[Marin Independent Journal]] |date=9 August 2010}}</ref>  They had one son, Mort Sahl Jr., who died March 27, 1996 at the age of 19.<ref>

==Recognition==
Sahl is ranked #40 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time.

Sahl, who is Jewish,<ref>{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Goldman |year=1990 |chapter=Laughtermakers |editor-last=Blacher Cohen |editor-first=Sarah |editor-link=Sarah Blacher Cohen |title=Jewish Wry: Essays on Jewish Humor |location=Detroit |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |page=80 |isbn=978-0814323663}}</ref> received the Fifth Annual [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]] Award in American Jewish Humor (2003) from the [[National Foundation for Jewish Culture]].

[[Woody Allen]] has said, "I adored Mort Sahl," and added he would not have become a comedian himself if not for Sahl's example, which proved a comedian could succeed with offhand intellectual material.  He compared Sahl's influence on comedy to the effect [[Charlie Parker]] had on jazz.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Woody |authorlink=Woody Allen |year=2004 |title=Woody Allen on Woody Allen |location=New York |publisher=[[Grove Press]] |pages=30-31 |isbn=978-0802142030}}</ref>  "I still find Mort Sahl funny," Allen said in 2008. "I was with him the other day, in California, and he's 81 and he's teaching at [[Claremont McKenna College|Claremont College]]. And he said they have a course out there that they offered him to teach, on the [[Holocaust]], and he didn't take it. He said, 'I wanted to see first how history judges the event.'"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |year=2008 |accessdate=11 March 2015 |url=http://nymag.com/anniversary/40th/50661/index2.html |title=In Conversation: Woody Allen |issn=0028-7369}}</ref> Allen introduced Sahl's 2002 stand-up appearance at [[Joe's Pub]] in [[New York City]] and attended a similar show several years later at "B.B. King's" in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Times Square]].
 
In 2011, the Library of Congress placed Mort Sahl's 1955 recording, ''At Sunset'', on the [[National Recording Registry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/essays/Mort%20Sahl%20At%20Sunset%20--%20laptop%20version5.pdf |title=Mort Sahl at Sunset (1955) |first=Daniel |last=Blazek |work=[[National Recording Registry]] |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |year=2011}}</ref>
