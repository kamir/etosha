{{Campaignbox Pacific War}}

In August 1945, during the final stage of the [[Second World War]], the United States '''dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki'''. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of [[nuclear weapon]]s for [[warfare]] in history.

As the [[World War II|Second World War]] entered its sixth and final year, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had begun to prepare for what was anticipated to be a very costly [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. This was preceded by an immensely destructive [[Air raids on Japan|firebombing campaign]] that obliterated many Japanese cities. The [[European theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] had concluded when [[Nazi Germany]] signed its [[German Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] on {{#dateformat:May 8, 1945}}, but with the Japanese refusal to accept the Allies' demands for unconditional surrender, the [[Pacific War]] dragged on. Together with the United Kingdom and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] on {{#dateformat:July 26, 1945}}; this was buttressed with the threat of "prompt and utter destruction".

By August 1945, the Allied [[Manhattan Project]] had successfully [[Trinity (nuclear test)|detonated an atomic device]] in the [[New Mexico]] desert and subsequently produced atomic weapons based on two alternate designs. The [[509th Composite Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] was equipped with a [[Silverplate]] [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] that could deliver them from [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. 

[[General Douglas MacArthur]] and other top military commanders favored continuing the conventional bombing of Japan already in effect and following up with a massive invasion, codenamed “Operation Downfall.” They advised [[President Truman]] that such an invasion would result in U.S. casualties of up to 1 million. In order to avoid such a high casualty rate, Truman decided–over the moral reservations of Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and a number of the [[Manhattan Project]] scientists–to use the atomic bomb in the hopes of bringing the war to a quick end. Proponents of the A-bomb–such as [[James F. Byrnes]], Truman’s secretary of state–believed that its devastating power would not only end the war, but also put the U.S. in a dominant position to determine the course of the postwar world.<ref>http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki</ref>

A uranium [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] atomic bomb ([[Little Boy]]) was dropped on [[Hiroshima]] on {{#dateformat:August 6, 1945}}, followed by a plutonium [[implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion-type]] bomb ([[Fat Man]]) on the city of [[Nagasaki]] on {{#dateformat:August 9}}. [[Little Boy]] exploded 2,000 feet above Hiroshima in a blast equal to 12-15,000 tons of TNT, destroying five square miles of the city. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000–80,000 in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]], and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.

On {{#dateformat:August 15}}, just days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)|declaration of war]], Japan announced [[Surrender of Japan|its surrender]] to the Allies. On {{#dateformat:September 2}}, it signed the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]], effectively ending World War II. The bombings' role in Japan's surrender and their ethical justification are [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|still debated]].

==Background==

===Pacific War===
{{main|Pacific War}}
[[File:1945-08-01JapWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|Situation of Pacific War by August 1, 1945. Japan still had control of all of [[Manchuria]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Indochina]], a large part of China, including most of the main Chinese cities, and much of the [[Dutch East Indies]]|alt=A map of East Asia and the Western Pacific during World War II]]
In 1945, the [[Pacific War]] between the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] entered its fourth year. The Japanese fought fiercely, ensuring that U.S. victory would come at an enormous cost. Of the 1.25&nbsp;million battle casualties incurred by the United States in [[World War II]], including both [[military personnel]] [[killed in action]] and [[wounded in action]], nearly one million occurred in the twelve-month period from June 1944 to June 1945. December 1944 saw American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German [[Ardennes Offensive]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2–3, 49–51}} In the Pacific the Allies [[Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)|returned to the Philippines]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=307}} [[Burma Campaign 1944–1945|recaptured Burma]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=532}} and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invaded Borneo]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=527}} Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], [[Aitape–Wewak campaign|New Guinea]] and the Philippines.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=48–49}} In April 1945, American forces [[Battle of Okinawa|landed on Okinawa]], where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2–3, 49–51}}

As the Allied advance moved inexorably towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 [[Gross register tonnage|gross tons]] in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S, produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the summer of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]] advised the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.{{sfn|Coox|1969|pp=2540–2544}}

===Preparations to invade Japan===
{{Main|Operation Downfall}}
Even before the [[Surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II|surrender of Nazi Germany]] on {{#dateformat:May 8, 1945}}, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=32–34}} The operation had two parts: Operations Olympic and Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=125–130}} Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the [[Kantō Plain]], near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of [[Honshu|Honshū]] by the U.S. [[First United States Army|First]], [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth]] and [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth]] Armies. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=169–171}}

[[File:"Jap...You're Next^ We'll Finish the Job" - NARA - 513563.jpg|thumb|left|upright|U.S. Army poster prepares the public for the invasion of Japan after ending war on Germany and Italy|alt=Uncle Sam holding a spanner, rolling up his sleeves]]
[[Geography of Japan|Japan's geography]] made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, [[Operation Ketsugō]], accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=45–48}} Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]] in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan,{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=21}} and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=70–72}} In all, there were 2.3&nbsp;million [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a [[Volunteer Fighting Corps|civilian militia]] of 28&nbsp;million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takijirō Ōnishi]], predicted up to 20&nbsp;million Japanese deaths.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=121–124}}

A study from {{#dateformat:June 15, 1945}}, by the Joint War Plans Committee,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Final Months of the War With Japan. Part III (note 24) |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-final-months-of-the-war-with-japan-signals-intelligence-u-s-invasion-planning-and-the-a-bomb-decision/csi9810001.html#rtoc7 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> who provided planning information to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], estimated that Olympic would result in between 130,000 and 220,000 U.S. casualties of which U.S. dead would be the range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on {{#dateformat:June 15, 1945}}, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General of the Army]] [[George Marshall]], and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]], signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=48}}

The Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through [[Ultra]] intelligence.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=202–225}} [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by [[Quincy Wright]] and [[William Shockley]]. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels [[James McCormack]] and [[Dean Rusk]], and examined casualty forecasts by [[Michael E. DeBakey]] and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4&nbsp;million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese casualties would have been around 5 to 10 million.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=340}}

Marshall began contemplating the use of a weapon which was "readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in American lives":{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=112}} [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]]. Quantities of [[phosgene]], [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], [[tear gas]] and [[cyanogen chloride]] were moved to [[Luzon]] from stockpiles in Australia and New Guinea in preparation for Operation Olympic, and MacArthur ensured that [[Chemical Warfare Service]] units were trained in their use.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=112}} Consideration was also given to using [[biological weapons]] against Japan.{{sfn|Schaffer|1985|pp=164–165}}

===Air raids on Japan===
{{Main|Air raids on Japan}}
[[File:Boeing B-29A-45-BN Superfortress 44-61784 6 BG 24 BS - Incendiary Journey.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of a four engined World War II-era aircraft being viewed from above while it is flying over a city. A large cloud of smoke is visible immediately below the aircraft.|A B-29 over Osaka on {{#dateformat:June 1, 1945}}]]
While the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] became ready for use in combat.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=4}} [[Operation Matterhorn]] involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around [[Chengdu]] in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=22–24}} This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=169–175}}

[[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Haywood S. Hansell]] determined that [[Guam]], [[Tinian]], and [[Saipan]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] would better serve as B-29 bases, but they were in Japanese hands.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=29–31}} Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war,{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=507–509}} and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|islands were captured]] between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed,{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=514–521}} and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=548–551}} These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=536–545}} The [[XXI Bomber Command]] began missions against Japan on {{#dateformat:November 18, 1944}}.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=558–560}}

The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called high-altitude [[precision bombing]], aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=566}} These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.{{sfn|Sandler|2001|pp=24–26}}{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=574–576}}

Hansell's successor, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Curtis LeMay]], assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=608–610}}
Under pressure from USAAF headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed tactics and decided that low-level [[Firebombing|incendiary raids]] against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to [[area bombardment]] with incendiaries.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=568–570}}

Like most [[strategic bombing during World War II]], the aim of the USAAF offensive against Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and [[demoralization (warfare)|undermine civilian morale]]. Civilians who took part in the [[war effort]] through such activities as building [[fortification]]s and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered [[combatants]] in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=83}}{{sfn|Werrell|1996|p=250}}

Over the next six months, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay firebombed 67 Japanese cities. The [[Bombing of Tokyo|firebombing of Tokyo]], codenamed ''Operation Meetinghouse'', on March 9–10 killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed {{convert|16|sqmi}} of the city and 267,000 buildings in a single night. It was the deadliest bombing raid of the war, at a cost of 20 B-29s shot down by flak and fighters.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=614–617}} By May, 75% of bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down Japan's "paper cities". By mid-June, Japan's six largest cities had been devastated.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=642–643}} The end of the fighting on Okinawa that month provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland, allowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated. Aircraft flying from Allied [[aircraft carrier]]s and the [[Ryukyu Islands]] also regularly struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall.{{sfn|Kerr|1991|p=207}} Firebombing switched to smaller cities, with populations ranging from 60,000 to 350,000. According to [[Yuki Tanaka]], the U.S. fire-bombed over a hundred Japanese towns and cities.<ref>Yuki Tanaka and Marilyn B. Young, "Bombing Civilians: A Twentieth Century History."(New York: New Press, 2009), 5,84-85, 117.</ref> These raids were also very devastating.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=653–658}}

The Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks and the country's [[civil defense]] preparations proved inadequate. Japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns had difficulty engaging bombers flying at high altitude.{{sfn|Coox|1994|pp=412–414}} From April 1945, the Japanese interceptors also had to face American fighter escorts based on [[Iwo Jima]] and Okinawa.{{sfn|Coox|1994|p=422}} That month, the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] stopped attempting to intercept the air raids in order to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=54}} By mid-1945 the Japanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country, in order to conserve supplies of fuel.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|pp=58–59}} By July 1945, the Japanese had stockpiled {{convert|1156000|USbbl}} of [[avgas]] for the invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=79–80}} While the Japanese military decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the Allied air raids.{{sfn|Coox|1994|p=429}}

Groves, Jr.]], of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], designed and built the first atomic bombs.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=89}}

The uranium atom was first [[Nuclear fission|split]] by German physicists [[Otto Hahn]] and his assistant [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938, making the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fearing that the [[German atomic bomb project]] would develop atomic weapons first, preliminary research in the U.S. began in late 1939.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=12}} Progress was slow until the arrival of the British [[MAUD Committee]] report in late 1941 showed that only 5-10 kilograms, and not 500 tons, of pure uranium was needed. [[Arthur H. Compton]] set up the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in Chicago, where, on {{#dateformat:December 2, 1942}} the first sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved. Groves appointed [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] to organize and head the project's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico.

Two types of bombs were eventually devised. The Hiroshima bomb, known as a [[Little Boy]], was a [[gun-type fission weapon]] that used [[uranium-235]], a rare [[isotope]] of uranium extracted in giant factories at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=522}} The other was a more powerful and efficient but more complicated [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] using [[plutonium-239]], a [[synthetic element]] created in [[nuclear reactor]]s at [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]]. A test implosion weapon, [[the gadget]], was detonated at [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity Site]], on {{#dateformat:July 16, 1945}}, near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=511–516}} The Nagasaki bomb, a [[Fat Man]], was a similar device.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=534–536}}

There was a [[Japanese nuclear weapon program]], but it lacked the human, mineral and financial resources of the Manhattan Project, and never made much progress towards developing an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Grunden|1998|pp=50–52}}

The 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom eventually deployed to Tinian.

These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] engines, Curtiss Electric [[Reverse thrust|reversible-pitch]] [[propeller]]s, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14–15}}

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on {{#dateformat:April 26, 1945}}, to its port of embarkation at [[Seattle]], Washington. On {{#dateformat:May 6}} the support elements sailed on the SS ''Cape Victory'' for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS ''Emile Berliner''. The ''Cape Victory'' made brief port calls at [[Honolulu]] and [[Eniwetok]] but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]] on Tinian, between {{#dateformat:May 15}} and {{#dateformat:May 22}}.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of 509th Composite Group – 313th Bombardment Wing – Twentieth Air Force – Activation to 15 August 1945 | year = 1945 | location = Tinian | publisher = Air Force Historical Research Agency | url = http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080128-037.pdf |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |pages=17–22}}</ref>

There were also two representatives from Washington, D.C., [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], the deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, and [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R. Purnell]] of the Military Policy Committee,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=100}} who were on hand to decide higher policy matters on the spot. Along with Captain [[William Sterling Parsons|William S.

===Choice of targets===

[[File:Handy to spaatz 1945.gif|thumb|upright|General [[Thomas Handy]]'s order to General [[Carl Spaatz]] authorizing the dropping of the atomic bombs]]
In April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, [[Colonel]] William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and [[David M. Dennison]] from the USAAF; and scientists [[John von Neumann]], [[Robert R. Wilson]] and [[William Penney, Baron Penney|William Penney]] from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on {{#dateformat:April 27}}; at Los Alamos on {{#dateformat:May 10}}, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on {{#dateformat:May 28}}, where it was briefed by Tibbets and [[Commander]] [[Frederick Ashworth]] from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, [[Richard C. Tolman]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=528–529}}

The Target Committee nominated five targets: [[Kokura]], the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; [[Hiroshima]], an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; [[Yokohama]], an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and [[Kyoto]], a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:
* The target was larger than {{convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and was an important target in a large urban area.
* The blast would create effective damage.
* The target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.<ref name="targetcommittee" />

These cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids and the Army Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the weapon could be made. Hiroshima was described as "an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good [[Incendiary device|incendiary]] target."<ref name="targetcommittee" />

The Target Committee stated that "It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1) obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released. Kyoto had the advantage of being an important center for military industry, as well an intellectual center and hence a population better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon. The [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Emperor's palace]] in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value."<ref name="targetcommittee">{{cite web| title=Atomic Bomb: Decision—Target Committee, May 10–11, 1945 | url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html | accessdate=August 6, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050808014201/http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html |archivedate=August 8, 2005 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[Edwin O. Reischauer]], a Japan expert for the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Intelligence Service]], was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of Kyoto.<ref name="targetcommittee"/> In his autobiography, Reischauer specifically refuted this claim:
{{quote|...&nbsp;the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is Henry&nbsp;L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier.{{sfn|Reischauer|1986|p=101}} <ref>{{cite journal |last =Kelly, Jason M.  |first = |authorlink = |title =Why Did Henry Stimson Spare Kyoto from the Bomb?: Confusion in Postwar Historiography |journal =Journal of American-East Asian Relations |volume =19 |issue = |pages =183-203 |publisher = |location = |date =2012 |language = |url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/18765610-01902004 |jstor = |issn = |doi = |accessdate = |ref= none}}</ref>}} On {{#dateformat:May 30}}, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=529}} Stimson then approached [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] about the matter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the target list.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=67–68}} Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July, but Stimson remained adamant.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}} On {{#dateformat:July 25}}, [[Nagasaki]] was put on the target list in place of Kyoto.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}}

Orders for the attack were issued to General [[Carl Spaatz]] on {{#dateformat:July 25}} under the signature of General [[Thomas T. Handy]], the acting Chief of Staff, since Marshall was at the [[Potsdam Conference]] with Truman.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=712–713}} That day, Truman noted in his diary that:{{quote|This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August&nbsp;10th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/documents/fulltext.php?fulltextid=15 |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |title=Pages from President Truman's diary, July 17, 18, and 25, 1945 |publisher=Harry S. Truman Library & Museum. }}</ref> }}

===Proposed demonstration===
In early May 1945, the [[Interim Committee]] was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to [[Nuclear technology|nuclear energy]].{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255–256}} During the meetings on {{#dateformat:May 31}} and {{#dateformat:June 1}}, scientist [[Ernest Lawrence]] had suggested giving the Japanese a non-combat demonstration.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=240}} [[Arthur Compton]] later recalled that:{{quote|It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=238–239}} }}
The possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the [[Franck Report]] issued by physicist [[James Franck]] on {{#dateformat:June 11}} and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on {{#dateformat:June 16}}, saying that "we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use." Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on {{#dateformat:June 21}} to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255–260}}

Like Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied [[prisoners of war]] might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would be available at the start of August, although more were in production, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.{{sfn|Newman|1995|p=86}}<ref name="Generals">{{cite web |title=The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date=August 13, 1945| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}</ref>

===Leaflets===
[[File:Firebombing leaflet.jpg|thumb|left|This type of leaflet was dropped on Japan, showing the names of 12 Japanese cities targeted for destruction by firebombing. The other side contained text saying "we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked&nbsp;..."|alt=B-29s dropping bombs. There are twelve circles with Japanese writing in them.]]
For several months, the U.S. had dropped more than 63&nbsp;million leaflets across Japan warning civilians of air raids. Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings, some were as much as 97% destroyed. LeMay thought that this would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the stigma of area bombing cities. Even with the warnings, [[Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan in World War II|Japanese opposition to the war]] remained ineffective. In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, but anyone who was caught in possession of one was arrested.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no3/article07.html |title=The Information War in the Pacific, 1945: Paths to Peace |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |first=Josette H. |last=Williams }}</ref>{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=656}} Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice "to appeal to their compatriots".{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=153}}

In preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, U.S. military leaders decided against a demonstration bomb, and against a special leaflet warning, in both cases because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation, and the wish to maximize [[Acute stress reaction|psychological shock]].{{sfn|McNelly|2000|p=138}} No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped.{{sfn|Lifton|1991|p=17}} Various sources give conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. [[Robert Jay Lifton]] writes that it was {{#dateformat:July 27}},{{sfn|Lifton|1991|p=17}} and Theodore H. McNelly that it was {{#dateformat:July 3}}.{{sfn|McNelly|2000|p=138}} The USAAF history notes eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on {{#dateformat:July 27}}, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on {{#dateformat:July 30}}.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=656}} Leaflet sorties were undertaken on {{#dateformat:August 1}} and {{#dateformat:August 4}}. It is very likely that Hiroshima was leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped.{{sfn|Lifton|1991|p=17}} One such leaflet lists twelve cities targeted for firebombing: [[Otaru]], [[Akita, Akita|Akita]], [[Hachinohe]], [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]], [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa]], [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]], [[Iwakuni]], [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]], [[Imabari]], [[Yawata]], [[Miyakonojo]], and [[Saga, Saga|Saga]].

===Potsdam Declaration===
Truman delayed the start of the summit by two weeks in the hope that the bomb could be tested before the start of negotiations with Stalin. The [[Trinity Test]] of {{#dateformat:July 16}} exceeded expectations. On {{#dateformat:July 26}}, Allied leaders issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]] outlining terms of surrender for Japan. It was presented as an [[ultimatum]] and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in "the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqué. On {{#dateformat:July 28}}, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Suzuki Kantarō]] declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (''yakinaoshi'') of the [[Cairo Declaration]] and that the government intended to ignore it (''[[mokusatsu]]'', "kill by silence").<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|1999|pp=233–234}}. The meaning of ''mokusatsu'' can fall anywhere in the range of "ignore" to "treat with contempt".</ref> The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.{{sfn|Bix|1996|p=290}} Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the imperial institution; that Japan not be occupied; that the Japanese armed forces be disbanded voluntarily; and that war criminals be prosecuted by Japanese courts.{{sfn|Asada|1996|p=39}}

Under the 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] with the United Kingdom, the United States had agreed that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945 the head of the [[British Joint Staff Mission]], [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|Henry Maitland Wilson]], agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be officially recorded as a decision of the [[Combined Policy Committee]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} At Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from [[Winston Churchill]] that Britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and [[Group Captain]] [[Leonard Cheshire]] were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=326, 356, 370}}

===Bombs===
The Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=262}} The uranium-235 projectile was completed on {{#dateformat:June 15}}, and the target on {{#dateformat:July 24}}.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=265}} The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left [[Hunters Point Naval Shipyard]], California, on {{#dateformat:July 16}} aboard the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}, arriving {{#dateformat:July 26}}.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=30}} The target inserts followed by air on {{#dateformat:July 30}}.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=265}}

The first [[plutonium core]], along with its [[polonium]]-[[beryllium]] [[urchin (detonator)|urchin initiator]], was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier [[Raemer Schreiber]] in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a [[neutron reflector|tamper]].{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=45}} The core departed from [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Army Air Field]] on a [[C-54]] transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's [[320th Troop Carrier Squadron]] on {{#dateformat:July 26}}, and arrived at North Field {{#dateformat:July 28}}. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on {{#dateformat:July 28}} by three B-29s, from the 393d Bombardment Squadron, plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on {{#dateformat:August 2}}.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=38–40}}

At the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both industrial and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]]'s [[Second General Army (Japan)|Second General Army]], which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan,{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=64–65, 163}} and was located in [[Hiroshima Castle]]. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1995|p=41}} Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the [[Fifty-Ninth Army (Japan)|59th Army]], the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Division]] and the [[224th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|224th Division]], a recently formed mobile unit.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=70, 163}} The city was defended by five batteries of {{convert|7|and|8|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, over 40,000 military personnel were stationed in the city.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=59}}

Hiroshima was a minor supply and logistics base for the Japanese military, but it also had large stockpiles of military supplies.<ref name="effects">{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/redocuments/1946/460619-bombing-survey1.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041011111052/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/redocuments/1946/460619-bombing-survey1.html |archivedate=October 11, 2004 |title=U.

On {{#dateformat:July 3}}, the Joint Chiefs of Staff placed it off limits to bombers, along with Kokura, Niigata and Kyoto.{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=263}}

The center of the city contained several [[reinforced concrete]] buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small wooden workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of wood with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around wood frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=38}}

The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a [[Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II|systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government]].

===The bombing===
Hiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on {{#dateformat:August 6}}, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 ''[[Enola Gay]]'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan. The ''Enola Gay'' (named after Tibbets' mother) was accompanied by two other B-29s. ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', commanded by Major [[Charles Sweeney]], carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, served as the photography aircraft.<ref name="509timeline">{{cite web | url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09C.htm| title=509th Timeline: Inception to Hiroshima| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>

During the night of August 5–6, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of numerous American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for [[Maebashi]], 261 en route to [[Nishinomiya]], 111 headed for [[Ube, Yamaguchi|Ube]] and 66 bound for Imabari. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. The all-clear was sounded in Hiroshima at 00:05.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=391–392}} About an hour before the bombing, the air raid alert was sounded again, as ''Straight Flush'' flew over the city. It broadcast a short message which was picked up by ''Enola Gay''. It read: "Cloud cover less than 3/10th at all altitudes. Advice: bomb primary."{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=414}} The all-clear was sounded over Hiroshima again at 07:09.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=415}}

At 08:09 Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier, Major [[Thomas Ferebee]].{{sfn|Allen|1969|p=2566}} The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy containing about {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of uranium-235 took 44.4 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at about {{convert|31000|ft|m|sp=us}} to a detonation height of about {{convert|1900|ft|m|sp=us}} above the city.{{sfn|Malik|1985|p=4}}{{sfn|Kerr et al|2005|pp=42–43}}<ref>{{harvnb|Malik|1985|}} describes how various values were recorded for the B-29's altitude at the moment of bomb release over Hiroshima. The strike report said 30,200&nbsp;ft, the official history said 31,600&nbsp;ft, Commander Parson's log entry was 32,700&nbsp;ft, and the navigator's log was 31,060&nbsp;ft—the latter possibly an error transposing two digits. A later calculation using the indicated atmospheric pressure arrived at the figure of 32,200&nbsp;ft. <br>Similarly, several values have been reported as the altitude of the Little Boy bomb at the moment of detonation. Published sources vary in the range of {{convert|1800|to|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the city.

===Events on the ground===
Some of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima had been very strongly constructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did not collapse even though they were fairly close to the blast center. Since the bomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways, which was largely responsible for the survival of the ''[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial|Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall]]'', now commonly known as the ''Genbaku'' (A-bomb) dome. This building was designed and built by the Czech architect [[Jan Letzel]], and was only {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} from ground zero. The ruin was named ''Hiroshima Peace Memorial'' and was made a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996 over the objections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the grounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss of life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective.<ref>{{cite web| title=Statements by China and the United States of America during the Inscription of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] | url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repco96x.htm#annex5 | accessdate=August 6, 2005 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050829222745/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repco96x.htm| archivedate=August 29, 2005 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Tokyo control operator of the [[NHK|Japan Broadcasting Corporation]] noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air.

All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office|Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]].<ref name="Official Report on the Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"/>

Military bases repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff.

After the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon. He stated, "We may be grateful to Providence" that [[German nuclear weapon project|the German atomic bomb project]] had failed, and that the United States and its allies had "spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won." Truman then warned Japan: "If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=100|title=Statement by the President Announcing the Use of the A-Bomb at Hiroshima |date=August 6, 1945 |publisher=[[Harry S.

The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: the preservation of the ''[[kokutai]]'' (Imperial institution and national [[polity]]), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], Korea, or [[Formosa]], and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.{{sfn|Bix|1996|p=512}}

On {{#dateformat:August 7}}, a day after Hiroshima was destroyed, Dr. [[Yoshio Nishina]] and other atomic physicists arrived at the city, and carefully examined the damage. They then went back to Tokyo and told the cabinet that Hiroshima was indeed destroyed by an atomic bomb. Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]], the Chief of the Naval General Staff, estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied, so they decided to endure the remaining attacks, acknowledging "there would be more destruction but the war would go on."{{sfn|Hoyt|2001|p=401}} American [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic codebreakers]] intercepted the cabinet's messages.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=283–284}}

The city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]], ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were [[Mitsubishi]] Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry.<ref name="Nagasaki"/> Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with [[AN/APQ-13]] radar.{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=263}}

Unlike the other target cities, Nagasaki had not been placed off limits to bombers by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's {{#dateformat:July 3}} directive,{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=263}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=309}} and was bombed on a small scale five times.

In contrast to Hiroshima, almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of wood or wood-frame buildings with wood walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of wood or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Robert|title=Nagasaki atomic bombing, 1945|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1945JAP2.html|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=353–354}}

Scheduled for {{#dateformat:August 11}} against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on {{#dateformat:August 10}}.{{sfn|Sherwin|2003|pp=233–23}} Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On {{#dateformat:August 8}}, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using ''[[Bockscar]]''<!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! --> as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the {{#dateformat:August 9}} mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=114}}

At 03:49 on the morning of {{#dateformat:August 9, 1945}}, ''Bockscar''<!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! -->, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.<ref name="SM16">{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07m1.htm| title=Timeline #3- the 509th; The Nagasaki Mission| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Agnew StrikeOrderNagasaki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Strike order for the Nagasaki bombing as posted {{#dateformat:August 8, 1945}}|alt=A page of typed instructions]]
During pre-flight inspection of ''Bockscar'', the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use {{convert|640|USgal}} of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have ''Bockscar'' continue the mission.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=204–205}}<ref name="The Story of Nagasaki">{{cite web |url=http://www.hiroshima-remembered.com/history/nagasaki/page3.html |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |title=The Story of Nagasaki}}</ref>

This time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as observers on the third plane, ''[[Big Stink (B-29)|Big Stink]]'', flown by the group's operations officer, Major James I. Hopkins, Jr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, ''Big Stink'' failed to make the rendezvous.<ref name="SM16" /> According to Cheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including {{convert|9000|ft}} higher than he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over [[Yakushima]] as previously agreed with Sweeney and Captain [[Frederick C. Bock]], who was piloting the support B-29 ''The Great Artiste''. Instead, Hopkins was flying {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} dogleg patterns.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|p=212}} Though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes, Sweeney continued to wait for ''Big Stink'', at the urging of Ashworth, the plane's weaponeer, who was in command of the mission.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=720}}

[[File:Atomic cloud over Nagasaki from Koyagi-jima.jpeg|thumb|Atomic cloud over Nagasaki]]
After exceeding the original departure time limit by a half hour, ''Bockscar'', accompanied by ''The Great Artiste'', proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby [[Yahata, Fukuoka|Yahata]] the previous day over Kokura. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned [[coal tar]], to produce black smoke.<ref>{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20140726p2a00m0na014000c.html| title=Steel mill worker reveals blocking view of U.S. aircraft on day of Nagasaki atomic bombing| publisher=Mainichi Weekly| accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant [[Jacob Beser]], who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=179, 213–215}}

After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low because of the failed fuel pump, they headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki.<ref name="SM16" /> Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that ''Bockscar'' had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would be forced to divert to [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.<ref name="Spitzer">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/COLLECTIONS/CG-ASPI/01/Pages/CGP-ASPI-025.htm| title=Spitzer Personal Diary Page 25 (CGP-ASPI-025)| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>

At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the "all clear" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53, the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.{{sfn|Chun|2008|p=70}}

A few minutes later at 11:00, ''The Great Artiste'' dropped instruments attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor [[Ryokichi Sagane]], a physicist at the [[University of Tokyo]] who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=295}} In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], met with Sagane and signed the document.<ref name="Stories from Riken">{{cite web| url=http://www.riken.jp/r-world/info/release/riken88/text/image/pdf/no09e.pdf| title=Stories from Riken | accessdate=April 30, 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>

At 11:01, a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed ''Bockscar'''s bombardier, Captain [[Kermit Beahan]], to visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core of about {{convert|6.4|kg|abbr=on}} of [[plutonium]], was dropped over the city's industrial valley at {{coord|32.77372|129.86325|display=inline}}. It exploded 47 seconds later at {{convert|1650|±|33|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, above a tennis court{{sfn|Kerr et al|2005|pp=43, 46}} halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works (Torpedo Works) in the north. This was nearly {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the [[Urakami|Urakami Valley]] and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills.{{sfn|Wainstock|1996|p=92}} The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to {{convert|21|±|2|ktonTNT|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Kerr et al|2005|pp=42–43}} The explosion generated heat estimated at {{convert|3900|C}} and winds that were estimated at {{convert|1005|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5234.htm |title=''The Atomic Bomb'' |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref>

''Big Stink'' spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away, and flew over to observe.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=346}} Because of the delays in the mission and the inoperative fuel transfer pump, ''Bockscar'' did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency landing field at Iwo Jima, so Sweeney and Bock flew to [[Okinawa]]. Arriving there, Sweeney circled for 20 minutes trying to contact the control tower for landing clearance, finally concluding that his radio was faulty. Critically low on fuel, ''Bockscar'' barely made it to the runway on Okinawa's [[Yontan Airfield]]. With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney and Albury brought ''Bockscar'' in at {{convert|150|mph}} instead of the normal {{convert|120|mph}}, firing distress flares to alert the field of the uncleared landing. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as ''Bockscar'' began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. The B-29's reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, ''Bockscar'' made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off the runway. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the plane came to a stop. The flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total remained.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=222–226}}

Following the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the plane. The first eyewitness account by war correspondent [[William L. Laurence]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'', who accompanied the mission aboard the aircraft piloted by Bock, reported that Sweeney was leading the mission in ''The Great Artiste''. He also noted its "Victor" number as 77, which was that of ''Bockscar'', writing that several personnel commented that 77 was also the jersey number of the football player [[Red Grange]].<ref name="Eyewitness">{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/Nagasaki.shtml |last=Laurence |first=William L.|authorlink=William Laurence |title=Eyewitness Account of Atomic Bomb Over Nagasaki |publisher=National Science Digital Library |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref> Laurence had interviewed Sweeney and his crew, and was aware that they referred to their airplane as ''The Great Artiste''. Except for ''Enola Gay'', none of the 393d's B-29s had yet had names painted on the noses, a fact which Laurence himself noted in his account. Unaware of the switch in aircraft, Laurence assumed Victor 77 was ''The Great Artiste'',{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=222}} which was in fact, Victor 89.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=184}}

==Plans for more atomic attacks on Japan==
[[File:Nagasaki temple destroyed.jpg|thumb|right|A Japanese report on the bombing characterized Nagasaki as "like a graveyard with not a tombstone standing"|alt=A pile of rubble surmounted by a statue of Buddha]]
Groves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on {{#dateformat:August 19}}, with three more in September and a further three in October.<ref name="Generals"/> On {{#dateformat:August 10}}, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that "the next bomb&nbsp;... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August." On the same day, Marshall endorsed the memo with the comment, "It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President."<ref name="Generals"/> Truman had secretly requested this on August 10. This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs "as made ready".<ref name="Eclipsed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki">{{cite journal |title=Eclipsed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki: Early Thinking about Tactical Nuclear Weapons |first=Barton J. |last=Bernstein |journal=[[International Security]] |issn=0162-2889 |volume=15 |issue=4 |date=Spring 1991 |pp=149–173 |jstor=2539014 }}</ref>

There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall. "The problem now [{{#dateformat:August 13}}] is whether or not, assuming the Japanese do not capitulate, to continue dropping them every time one is made and shipped out there or whether to hold them&nbsp;... and then pour them all on in a reasonably short time. Not all in one day, but over a short period. And that also takes into consideration the target that we are after. In other words, should we not concentrate on targets that will be of the greatest assistance to an invasion rather than industry, morale, psychology, and the like? Nearer the tactical use rather than other use."<ref name="Generals"/>

==Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation==
{{Main|Surrender of Japan|Occupation of Japan}}
Until {{#dateformat:August 9}}, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender. On that day Hirohito ordered [[Kōichi Kido]] to "quickly control the situation&nbsp;... because the Soviet Union has declared war against us." He then held an Imperial conference during which he authorized minister [[Shigenori Tōgō]] to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration "does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler."{{sfn|Kido|Yoshitake|1966|p=1223}}

On {{#dateformat:August 12}}, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka|Prince Asaka]], then asked whether the war would be continued if the ''kokutai'' could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied "Of course."{{sfn|Fujiwara|1991|p=129}} As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on {{#dateformat:August 14}} his [[Gyokuon-hōsō|capitulation announcement]] which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a short [[Kyūjō Incident|rebellion]] by militarists opposed to the surrender.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=316–319}}

In his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings:
{{quote|Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

Such being the case, how are We to save the millions of Our subjects, or to atone Ourselves before the hallowed spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors? This is the reason why We have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the Joint Declaration of the Powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/yosha/yr/empires/Imperial_rescript_1945-08-14.html |title=Imperial Rescript ending war – What Hirohito really said in his acceptance speech |others=translated by William Wetherall |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |publisher=Yosha Research  }}</ref> }}

In his "Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors" delivered on {{#dateformat:August 17}}, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion and his decision to surrender, omitting any mention of the bombs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwandocuments.org/surrender07.htm |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |publisher=Taiwan Document Project |title=Emperor Hirohito's Surrender Rescript to Japanese Troops}}</ref> Hirohito met with General MacArthur on {{#dateformat:September 27}}, saying to him that "[t]he peace party did not prevail until the bombing of Hiroshima created a situation which could be dramatized." Furthermore, the "Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors" speech he told MacArthur about was just personal, not political, and never stated that the Soviet intervention in Manchuria was the main reason for surrender. In fact, a day after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Hirohito ordered his advisers, primarily [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Hisatsune Sakomizu]], Kawada Mizuho, and [[Masahiro Yasuoka]], to write up a surrender speech. In Hirohito's speech, days before announcing it on radio on {{#dateformat:August 15}}, he gave three major reasons for surrender: Tokyo's defenses would not be complete before the American invasion of Japan, [[Ise Shrine]] would be lost to the Americans, and atomic weapons deployed by the Americans would lead to the death of the entire Japanese race. Despite the Soviet intervention, Hirohito did not mention the Soviets as the main factor for surrender.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=234–240}}

Motion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On {{#dateformat:October 24, 1945}}, a [[Military Police Corps (United States)|U.S. military policeman]] stopped a Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were then confiscated by the American authorities. These reels were in turn requested by the Japanese government, declassified, and saved from oblivion.

In the spring of 1948, the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] (ABCC) was established in accordance with a presidential directive from Truman to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] – [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/10/5426.full |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |title=The Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Retrospect |first=Frank W. |last=Putnam |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref> One of the early studies conducted by the ABCC was on the outcome of pregnancies occurring in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in a [[Controlling for a variable|control]] city, [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], located {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Hiroshima, in order to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rerf.or.jp/index_e.html |title=The Radiation Effects Research Foundation Website |publisher=Rerf.or.jp |accessdate=March 25, 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090308004959/http://rerf.or.jp/index_e.html| archivedate=March 8, 2009 | deadurl=no}}</ref> Dr. [[James V.

There is a bridge in the distance, and a ruined domed building in the middle distance. People walk along the footpath that runs parallel to the river]]

The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. J. Samuel Walker wrote in an April 2005 overview of recent historiography on the issue, "the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue." He wrote that "The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States."{{sfn|Walker|2005|p=334}}

Supporters of the bombings generally assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing casualties on both sides during Operation Downfall. One figure of speech, "One hundred million [subjects of the Japanese Empire] will die for the Emperor and Nation,"{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|pp=23–24}} served as a unifying slogan, although that phrase was intended as a figure of speech along the lines of the "[[ten thousand years]]" phrase.{{sfn|Brooks|Stanley|2007|pp=41–44}} In Truman's 1955 ''Memoirs'', "he states that the atomic bomb probably saved half a million U.S. lives— anticipated casualties in an Allied invasion of Japan planned for November. Stimson subsequently talked of saving one million U.S. casualties, and Churchill of saving one million American and half that number of British lives."{{sfn|Selden|Selden|1990|pp=xxx–xxxi}} Scholars have pointed out various alternatives that could have ended the war without an invasion, but these alternatives could have resulted in the deaths of many more Japanese.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=97–114}} Supporters also point to an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on {{#dateformat:August 1, 1944}}, ordering the execution of Allied prisoners of war when the POW camp was in the combat zone.<ref>[[s:Kill All Prisoners Order]] (Introduced into the Tokyo War Crimes Trials in January 1947 as Document No. 2701 (Certified as Exhibit "O" in Doc. No. 2687)) — {{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/usprisoners_japancomp.htm |title=U.S. Prisoners of War and Civilian American Citizens Captured and Interned by Japan in World War II: The Issue of Compensation by Japan|series=Congressional Research Service Report for Congress |first=Gary K. |last=Reynolds |date=December 17, 2002}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}} One of the few existing original copy of this general order was found by [[Jack Edwards (Hong Kong)|Jack Edwards]] after the war, in the ruins of the [[Kinkaseki]] prisoner of war camp.{{harvnb|Edwards|Walter|1991|p=260}}</ref>

Those who oppose the bombings cite a number of reasons for their view, among them: a belief that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral, that the bombings counted as war crimes, that they were militarily unnecessary, that they constituted state terrorism,{{sfn|Stohl|1979|p=[http://books.google.com/?id=R60c_2nCcnYC&pg=PA279 279]}} and that they involved racism against and the dehumanization of the Japanese people. Another popular view among critics of the bombings, originating with [[Gar Alperovitz]] in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, is the idea of atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=James J. |year=2008 |title=Review of ''Hiroshima in History: The Myths of Revisionism'' and ''The End of the Pacific War'' |journal=Journal of Japanese Studies |issn=0095-6848 |volume=34 |issue=2, |pp=521–529 |jstor=27756604 }}</ref> The bombings were part of an already fierce conventional bombing campaign. This, together with the sea blockade and the collapse of Germany (with its implications regarding redeployment), could also have led to a Japanese surrender. At the time United States dropped its atomic bomb on Nagasaki on {{#dateformat:August 9, 1945}}, the Soviet Union launched [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|a surprise attack]] with 1.6&nbsp;million troops against the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. "The Soviet entry into the war", argued Japanese historian [[Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]], "played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow's mediation".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/08/14/historians-soviet-offensive-key-japans-wwii-surrender-eclipsed-bombs/ |accessdate=September 18, 2013 |newspaper=[[Fox news]] |title=Historians: Soviet offensive, key to Japan's WWII surrender, was eclipsed by A-bombs }}</ref>
