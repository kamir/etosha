'''David James''' "'''Dave'''" '''Gorman'''<ref name="DGGA1">''[[Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure]]''</ref> (born 2 March 1971)<ref name=DGGA1/> is an English comedian, author, and television presenter. He has performed comedy shows on stage in which he tells stories of his extreme adventures and presents the evidence to the audience in order to prove to them that they are true. He was a stand-up comedian before he became famous for ''[[Are You Dave Gorman?]]''.

Gorman took a break from stand-up to undertake a sponsored hitchhike around the pacific rim countries. He began and ended this journey in [[Ucluelet]], [[Canada]]. He returned to stand-up in 2009 with a show called ''Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up'' whose unique feature was that he bicycled 1,563 miles from the southernmost point of Britain to the easternmost to the westernmost and then to the northernmost, with a gig following each night.

==Early life==
Gorman was born in [[Stafford]], [[Staffordshire]],<ref name=DGGA1/> the son of Derek Gorman and Fay Collins, who are now divorced. He attended [[Walton High School (Stafford)|Walton High School]]. He studied mathematics at the [[University of Manchester]] but never graduated, dropping out after a year of study.<ref name="university">{{cite web

==Career==

===Early work===
Before his solo successes, he was in demand as a writer, having co-written three series of ''[[The Mrs Merton Show]]'', as well as writing for many other television series in the UK, including ''[[The Fast Show]]''. In 2003, he was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in [[British comedy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/dec/07/comedy.thebestofbritishcomedy1|title=The A-Z of laughter (part one)|publisher=[[The Observer]]|date=7 December 2003|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> As a producer, Gorman contributed to two series featuring [[Jenny Eclair]]; as a writer he contributed to ''[[The Mrs Merton Show]]''. He has also written for comedians [[Harry Hill]] and [[Steve Coogan]].

Gorman's first one-man "documentary style" show was entitled ''Reasons to be Cheerful''. Billed as "a ninety minute show based on a four minute pop song", it was based on the song "[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3]]" by [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]]. The show examined the song's lyrics in detail, with a view to establishing whether or not each of the items listed in the song was really a reason to be cheerful. The visual aspect of the show was provided by each "reason" being illustrated by one of a collection of second-hand slides that he had accumulated for the show. The show was first performed at the [[1998 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and toured theatres afterwards.

His second full length show, ''Dave Gorman's Better World'', was first performed in Edinburgh in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davegorman.com/projects_better_world.html|title=Dave Gorman: Better World|work=davegorman.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> For the show he wrote anonymous letters to thousands of local newspapers and asked the public to suggest ways in which one man could make the world a better place. He then attempted to carry out their suggestions in order to determine their efficacy.

===''Are You Dave Gorman?''===
{{Main|Are You Dave Gorman?}}

Gorman shot to fame following a drunken bet with his flatmate [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]]. The bet was thus: Gorman claimed that he shared the name "Dave Gorman" with the assistant manager of [[East Fife F.C.]] and that there must be "loads" of others around.<ref name=TDS1>{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/xipl79/dave-gorman|title=Dave Gorman - The Daily Show|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=11 December 2001|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> Danny disagreed with him, so the two travelled to [[Methil]] (about 450 miles from London), with a [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] camera, to meet the assistant manager, whose name was indeed Dave Gorman. The bet soon evolved into a monster: on the way to meet Dave Gormans numbers 4 and 5, Danny decided Gorman must meet one for every card in the deck (including the Jokers). His quest to meet this target was described, highlights including five people changing their names by [[deed poll]] (two of whom were women), and a trip to New York that resulted in failure when he discovered the man he had gone to meet was not Dave Gorman, but B. David Gorman and therefore was ineligible. The American journey also included a meeting with an actor who had played a character called David Gorman, the validity of which is hotly contested in the book.

===''Dave Gorman's Important Astrology Experiment''===
His second television series, broadcast on [[BBC Two]], was entitled ''Dave Gorman's Important Astrology Experiment'' and was based upon the idea of a controlled [[Experiment|scientific experiment]], although naturally not a serious one. The series had six episodes.

The premise was that it would test whether or not [[astrology]] really worked. Over the course of 40 days, he would try to follow any instructions given to people with his [[Astrological sign|star sign]] in a selection of [[horoscope]]s, while his "control experiment" (his twin brother, Nick) ignored them. Each would record the events of each day, and how they fared in each of three areas of life: love, health and wealth. On each episode of the show, Gorman would show footage of the amusing situations he got into by trying to follow his horoscope, and then asked a panel of "experts", agony aunt [[Denise Robertson (presenter)|Denise Robertson]] (love), [[GMTV]]'s [[Hilary Jones (doctor)|Dr. Hilary Jones]] (health) and financial expert [[Alvin Hall]] (money), in the studio to assess how he had fared in the three areas. Following an audience vote, Gorman would display on a "happiness graph" the difference between how he and his twin brother had fared that week, and whether it showed that astrology had produced a positive effect, a negative effect, or no significant effect at all.

The results of the "experiment" showed that his overall happiness, love, and wealth steadily began to recede over time (especially wealth as he was forced to travel excessively). Throughout the experiment, he had numerous adventures, including travelling to [[New York]] to meet a long lost friend and then leaving a few hours later because he was ordered to spend as much time at home as possible, sharing pizza in a park while dressed in a rubber suit, and reading an illegally acquired [[pornographic magazine]] at Sunday lunch in front of his mother.

The most notable stunt he had to perform was standing in [[Covent Garden]] on one leg with his foot in a bucket of water, a tangerine in one hand and some breakfast cereal in the other (in a bowl that cost £85 from [[Harrods]]), singing the national anthem backwards and balancing three books on his head. This was taken entirely literally from a very odd horoscope by [[Jonathan Cainer]], which Gorman deemed so implausible that he did in fact present the copy of the newspaper which published it in the studio, while noting his suspicion that perhaps the author of the horoscope found out about his experiment and was pulling a prank on him.

Gorman showed that his wealth was rapidly declining, as were happiness and love, until, on the last day, he invested the last of his money to travel to [[Dubai]] to watch a golf tournament (the ''[[Dubai Desert Classic]]'') and bet on [[Ian Woosnam]], a golfer that shared his birthday (and would therefore share his luck). He emptied his account to travel there and, using his [[lucky number]] of the day from each of the 40 days of his experiment to determine how much he should bet, went ahead with the plan. However, he then found out that not only was gambling illegal in the country, but also that his lucky number indicated he should bet 2,903 [[United Arab Emirates dirham|Dirhams]], which at the time was £549. Ultimately, he borrowed the money from his mother and asked her to bet the sum on Ian Woosnam to win the match of the day, as he had been instructed by his horoscope.

With his happiness at an all time low, love scraping the bottom, and his finances in an extremely negative position, the experts, his mother, Danny, the crowd and Gorman himself could only hope the bet would pay off – which it ultimately did at odds long enough to place him not only back at level wealth, but supplying him with twice as much cash as he had started off with. Therefore, he "proved" that astrology works and has made him happier than the control.

===''Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure''===
In 2003, Gorman toured Britain with a show entitled ''Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure'', and published a book of the same name. It is another true story. At 31 Gorman decided to give up his stupid ways, grow a beard and write a novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/13/dave-gorman-googlewhack-adventure-comedy-gold|title=Comedy gold – Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure|author=Bruce Dessau|work=the Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> As a result he believes people took him more seriously and a new novel was commissioned. While trying to write a novel for his publisher, [[Random House]], Gorman became obsessed with [[Googlewhack]]s when someone notified him that his site had one (Francophile Namesakes), and caused him to travel across the world finding people who had authored them (one of whom turned out to be one of the Dave Gormans he had met in his first adventure). He eventually spent his publisher's advance on the quest, without writing any of the promised novel, and had to create the ''Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure'' show to pay them back.

This show was premiered at the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and then went on to sell out for a two-week run at the [[Sydney Opera House]]'s Studio Theatre. It also sold out at the George Square Theatre as part of the [[2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] before embarking on a major UK tour of 75 shows in the space of three months. It won Gorman the award for Best One Person Show at the [[HBO]] [[U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]] in [[Aspen, Colorado]], an award he had previously won for the show ''Are You Dave Gorman?'' He ended up writing a book about his Googlewhack Adventure which went on to be the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' number one best seller. During his Googlewhack adventure, Gorman had a [[nervous breakdown]], which he discusses frankly in the show.

In 2004, a DVD of the ''Googlewhack Adventure'' was released which was filmed at [[Swansea Grand Theatre]]. In 2005, Gorman toured the U.S. and performed his ''Googlewhack'' show in several cities. While in Los Angeles, he appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', elaborating on his travels and his quest. This tour, in which he stayed at chain motels and experienced corporate America, led him to undertake a road-trip across the U.S. in which he avoided such hotels and corporate petrol stations in favour of family-owned businesses. The road trip was documented as the book and film ''America Unchained''.

===''Genius''===

====Radio series====

{{Main|Genius (Radio series)}}

He hosts a [[BBC Radio 4]] show called ''[[Genius (Radio series)|Genius]]'', in which members of the public submit suggestions to make a better world. Gorman and a guest then assess the idea in order to determine whether it qualifies as "genius". One series of five episodes was broadcast between 27 October and 24 November 2005, with a CD of the first series released on 27 November 2006. The second series was broadcast between 7 September and 12 October 2006, with a CD released in 7 January 2008 and a third series between 1 October and 5 November 2007. He has made many references to disliking [[Darren Day]] in various episodes of the show.

====TV series====

===''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''===

On 24 April 2006, Gorman made his first appearance as a reporter (he had previously appeared as a guest on 11 December 2001 promoting ''[[Are You Dave Gorman?]]''),<ref name=TDS1/> in which he was credited as the show's senior new correspondent.<ref name=TDS2>{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/r11rm8/gorman---royal-treatment|title=Gorman - Royal Treatment|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=24 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> On 27 April, he debuted as the host of the show's satirical statistical analysis piece called "Poll Smoking with Dave Gorman".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/vv9h7b/poll-smoking---president-s-approval-rating|title=Poll Smoking - President's Approval Rating|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=27 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> He was the first ''Daily Show'' correspondent to have been born in England, and the third ''Daily Show'' correspondent to have been born outside of the United States.

===''Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive''===
Gorman also regularly appeared on the [[BBC Three]] show, ''[[Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive]]'', a comedy show about the making of a celebrity panel show hosted by [[Rob Brydon]]. Gorman is one of the show's team captains. In 2006 he became an occasional contributor on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''. He also hosts his own radio series, ''Genius'', and his documentary feature, ''America Unchained'', was shown on [[More4]] in February 2008. The book of the series was published in April 2008.<ref>ISBN 978-0-09-189933-2</ref>

===''America Unchained''===

Between 22 October and 5 December 2006, Gorman undertook a coast-to-coast road trip through 17 states from the west coast to east coast of the [[United States]]. A book about the trip, entitled ''America Unchained: A Freewheeling Roadtrip in Search of Non-Corporate USA'', was released on 3 April 2008. The rationale for the trip was to discover whether it is possible to travel across the USA without ever patronising any corporate or chain-style businesses ("[[The Man]]"). Gorman ate, slept, and filled his car in restaurants, hotels, and petrol stations which were all independently owned.

America Unchained also is the name of an annual campaign spearheaded by the [[American Independent Business Alliance]] since 2004 to promote the economic, cultural, and democratic importance of independent locally-owned businesses. A documentary film of the adventure was also made and was aired on the British TV channel [[More4]] on 5 February 2008 and released on DVD on 11 February. In 2007, it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at the [[Austin Film Festival]].

Gorman's journey started in [[Coronado, California]] and ended in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and he was continually challenged to find independently owned gas stations, as well as repairing the car itself – which broke down surprisingly little, considering the age and mileage (124,000 at start).

===Absolute Radio===

Gorman was a regular guest on ''[[The Geoff Show]]'', having been on a guest on the show three times (and also entering a phone-in competition whilst undertaking the ''Important Astrology Experiment''), while he also had weekly interviews on ''[[Geoff Lloyd's Hometime Show]]'' to discuss his bikeathon during his ''Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up Tour''. He filled in for weekend presenter [[Frank Skinner]] for thre weeks during the summer of 2009. The station subsequently announced that he would have a full-time show; his first show aired on 11 October, with Gorman joined by [[Danielle Ward]] and [[Martin White (comedian)|Martin White]].<ref>http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.5144.2</ref> White left the show in April 2012, to be replaced by [[Michael Legge (comedian)|Michael Legge]]. The show ended on 18 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stephenson |first=John-Paul |url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/11/opinion-a-tribute-to-the-dave-gorman-show/ |title=A tribute to The Dave Gorman Show |work=Giggle Beats |date=18 November 2012 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

===Stand-up===

Gorman has performed numerous times as a stand up earlier in his career but more recently, on 30 August 2009 he began a 32-date tour called Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up. The tour saw him covering the extremes of the British mainland as he cycled from Britain's southernmost point to its northernmost tip, taking in the most easterly and westerly points along the way and performing each night of the journey.

In 2010, Gorman performed a 37-date tour as an extension of his 2009 ''Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up Tour''. About this show he says: "I won't be cycling to these. Same show, fewer blisters." On 12 July 2010, he performed the show again – twice in one evening – at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] in London, which was recorded for a future DVD release. Prior to the recording, Gorman performed the act again as ''The Warm Up Show'' at four small venues in the UK in order to freshen his memory.

===Other appearances===
Gorman appeared on two episodes of ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', including the famous episode aired in the week where news of host [[Angus Deayton]]'s scandal involving prostitutes and use of illegal drugs broke. He also appeared in one episode of sport comedy quiz ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]''. Gorman also appeared on episode nine on the [[QI (A series)|A Series]] of ''[[QI]]'' with [[Jo Brand]] and [[Jeremy Hardy]], in which he won. He appeared again in 2011 in the [[QI (I series)|I Series]], winning again. Gorman was a regular alongside [[Geoff Lloyd]] on [[Virgin Radio (UK)|Virgin Radio]]'s ''[[The Geoff Show]]'', also appearing on the same presenter's ''[[Geoff Lloyd's Hometime Show|Hometime Show]]'', following the station's rebranding as [[Absolute Radio]], before Gorman joined the station as a presenter himself.

When [[Lee Mack]] appeared on a ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' celebrity special on 3 January 2012, Gorman was the phone-a-friend to whom Mack turned, successfully identifying ''[[Carte Blanche (novel)|Carte Blanche]]'' as a [[James Bond]] novel.

In September 2013, he returned to television with a new show ''Modern Life is Goodish'' launched on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a469935/dave-gorman-lands-new-dave-tv-show-modern-life-is-goodish.html#~oBHW7b3HQlRZ9Z|title=Dave Gorman lands new Dave TV show 'Modern Life Is Goodish'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> In January 2014, the show was renewed for two more series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a469935/dave-gorman-lands-new-dave-tv-show-modern-life-is-goodish.html#~oBHIo5iSa7saCe|title=Dave Gorman's Modern Life Is Goodish gets two more series from Dave|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=27 January 2014|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>

[[Staffordshire University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2006. He is a fan of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool FC]].<ref>An October 2010 episode of ''[[Soccer AM]]''</ref>

During a drunken binge in [[Austin, Texas]] in 2003, Gorman had a cartoonish rendition of his driver's licence tattooed on his arm, complete with the incorrect formatting of his birth date due to differences in how the United States and United Kingdom write out dates of birth.<ref name=DGGA1/> He states that he regrets this decision "100%".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tntdownunder.com/entertainment/interviews/interview-with-dave-gorman|title=Interview with Dave Gorman|work=TNT Magazine|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>

In his stand-up show ''Dave Gorman's Powerpoint Presentation'' at the 2011 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], Gorman stated that he is an "[[Atheism|atheist]] from a [[Christianity|Christian]] background".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/Living/Stage/article/16414/edinburgh-fringe-dave-gorman-s-powerpoint-presentation.html|title=Error messages - The Courier - At the heart of Tayside and Fife|work=thecourier.co.uk|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> However, he is frequently incorrectly assumed to be [[Jewish]]; for example, the Jewish magazine ''JLifestyle'' includes him in a list of "literary Jews".<ref>[http://www.jlifestyle.co.uk/issue3/ 25 Literary Jews] JLifestyle, Issue 3, April/May 2008.</ref>
