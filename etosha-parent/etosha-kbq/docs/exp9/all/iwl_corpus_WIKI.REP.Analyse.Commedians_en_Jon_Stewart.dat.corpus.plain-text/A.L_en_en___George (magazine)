'''''George''''' was a glossy monthly magazine centered on the theme of politics-as-lifestyle co-founded by [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] (1960–1999) and [[Michael J. Berman]] with publisher [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]] in [[New York|New York City]] in September 1995. Its tagline was "Not Just Politics as Usual". It was published from 1995 to 2001.

==Overview==
For the debut issue, creative director Matt Berman conceived a cover which received a great deal of attention for its image of [[Cindy Crawford]] dressed as [[George Washington]] photographed by [[Herb Ritts]].

''George'' departed from the format of traditional political publications, whose audience primarily comprised people in or around the political world. The general template for ''George'' was similar to magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'' or ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. The consistent underlying theme was to marry the themes of celebrity and media with the subject of politics in such a way that the general public would find political news and discourse about politics more interesting to read.

==Reception==
When it first appeared, ''George'' attracted great interest, and for a brief period had the largest circulation of any political magazine in the nation, partly due to the celebrity status of Kennedy, but it soon began losing money. Kennedy later complained that the magazine was not taken seriously in the publishing world.

Critics called ''George'' "the political magazine for people who don't understand politics", assailing it for "stripping any and all discussion of political issues from its coverage of politics". In a feature in its final issue, ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine asserted that the magazine's premise was flawed; there was no real convergence of politics and celebrity lifestyles.

==Decline==
After Kennedy was [[John F.

On October 11, 2005, [[Harvard University]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]] held a panel discussion titled "Not Just Politics as Usual", which commemorated the tenth anniversary of the magazine's launch. The panel was moderated by [[Tom Brokaw]] and featured appearances by other journalists.
