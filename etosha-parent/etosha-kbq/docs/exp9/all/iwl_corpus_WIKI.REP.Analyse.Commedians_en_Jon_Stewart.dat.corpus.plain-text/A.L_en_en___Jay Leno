'''James Douglas Muir "Jay" Leno''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|n|oʊ}}; born April 28, 1950) is an American comedian, actor, writer, producer, voice actor and television host. Leno was the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' from 1992 to 2009.

After ''The Jay Leno Show'' was canceled in January 2010 amid a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|host controversy]], Leno returned to host ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' on March 1, 2010.<ref name="thewrap">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/new-nbc-breaking-story-13241 |title=Exclusive: Conan, NBC Officially Splitsville (Updated) |first=Josef |last=Adalian |date=January 21, 2010 |work=The Wrap |accessdate=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> Leno hosted his last episode of ''The Tonight Show'' on February 6, 2014.

Retrieved June 28, 2013.</ref> During the 1970s, Leno appeared in minor roles in several television series and films, first in the 1976 episode "J.J. in Trouble" of ''[[Good Times]]'' and the same year in the pilot of ''[[Holmes & Yo-Yo]]''. After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', he played more prominent parts in 1978 in ''[[American Hot Wax]]'' and ''[[Silver Bears]]''. Other films and television series from that period include ''Almost Heaven'' (1978), "Going Nowhere" (1979) from ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'' (1979), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), "The Wild One" (1981) from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', and both "Feminine Mistake" (1979) and "Do the Carmine" (1983) from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''. Leno's only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video ''[[Collision Course (1989 film)|Collision Course]]'', opposite [[Pat Morita]]. He also appeared numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.

===''The Tonight Show''===
[[File:Jay Leno (1993) by Alan Light.jpg|thumb|upright|right|200px|Leno in 1993, in the year after becoming host of ''The Tonight Show'']]
Starting in 1987, Leno was a regular substitute host for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host<ref>{{cite news|title=Carson cuts appearances|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQMIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SzYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5008,192179&dq=tonight+jay-leno+shandling|agency=Associated Press|work=Rome News-Tribune|location=Rome, Ga.|page=14|date=June 2, 1987|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref> amid controversy with [[David Letterman]], who had been hosting ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' since 1982 (aired after ''The Tonight Show''), and whom many—including Carson himself—had expected to be Carson's successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into [[The Late Shift (book)|a book]] and [[The Late Shift (film)|a movie]]. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on ''The Tonight Show''.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with [[NBC]] which would keep him as host of ''The Tonight Show'' until 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC signs Jay Leno to contract extension|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-30-leno-contract-extended_x.htm |agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref> Later in 2004, [[Conan O'Brien]] signed a contract with NBC under which O'Brien would become the host of ''The Tonight Show'' in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Conan O'Brien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?pagewanted=print&position= |work=The New York Times|date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref>

During the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]], Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for ''The Tonight Show''. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/lenowga-whats-the-real-story-nbc-claims-jay-asked-for-received-wga-permission-to-write-monologue-at-monday-meeting-with-verrone-et-al/|title=LENO/WGA: WHAT'S THE REAL STORY?

In 1998, Leno competed in a tag-team match at the WCW's [[Road Wild#1998|Road Wild]] pay-per-view. Since 2001, he has voiced [[The Crimson Chin]], a recurring superhero in the [[Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[The Fairly OddParents]].''

Leno said in 2008, that he was saving all of his income from ''The Tonight Show'' and living solely off his income from stand-up comedy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-16-leno-cover_N.htm|title=Jay Leno Gears up for Life After 'Tonight'|last=della Cava|first=Marco|date=July 17, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 25, 2009}}</ref>

On April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself into a hospital with an undisclosed illness.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/23/leno.hospitalized/index.html | title = Jay Leno hospitalized; 'Tonight Show' tapings canceled | first = Jack | last = Hannah | work = [[CNN.com]] | date = April 23, 2009 | publisher = [[Cable News Network]] | accessdate = August 14, 2009 }}</ref> He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27.

====Michael Jackson trial====
During the [[People v. Jackson|2005 trial of Michael Jackson]] over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, that no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but that the calls seemed unusual and scripted.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html|title=Comedians Jay Leno and Chris Tucker testify for Michael Jackson|publisher=[[Court TV]]|date=May 24, 2005|author=Sweetingham, Lisa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195750/http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html |archivedate= March 15, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:JayLeno.jpg|thumb|right|Leno in 2006.]]
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to continue telling jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of ''The Tonight Show''{{'}}s opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Brad Garrett]], and [[Dennis Miller]] among others.<ref>{{cite episode|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/08/sbt.01.html|title=Nemcova Speaks Out on Surviving Tsunami; Michael Jackson`s Trial Continues; Interview With Kevin Costner |series=[[Showbiz Tonight]]|publisher=CNN|airdate=March 8, 2005|first=Karyn|last=Bryant}}</ref>

===Succession by Conan O'Brien and ''The Jay Leno Show''===
{{Main|The Jay Leno Show}}
Because Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the [[Nielsen ratings]], the pending expiration of Leno's contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network after his commitment to NBC expired.<ref>{{cite news|first=Frazier|last=Moore|title=NBC's Jay Leno-Conan O'Brien swap prompts rumors|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678|agency=Associated Press|work=Newsday|date=May 14, 2008|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> Leno left ''The Tonight Show'' on Friday May 29, 2009,<ref>{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Date Is Set for Leno's 'Tonight' Finale|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22late.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/T/Television|work=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/arts/television/30leno.html?em|title=Jay Leno Takes Final Bow on 'Tonight Show' |date=May 30, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 30, 2009 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}</ref> and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.

On December 8, 2008, it was reported that Leno would remain on NBC and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. Central Time) five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/business/media/09leno.html?em|title = Where Is Leno Going?

Jay Leno's new show, titled ''The Jay Leno Show'', debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the [[Television Critics Association]] summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, the occasional musical guest, and keep the popular "Headlines" segments, which would air near the end of the show. First guests included [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (via satellite), and a short sit-down with [[Kanye West]] discussing his controversy at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], which had occurred the night before.<ref>[http://www.tvshark.com/read/?art=arc3888 Jay Leno Reveals What To Expect From His New Primetime Show]</ref>

===Timeslot conflict and return to ''The Tonight Show''===
{{wikinews|US TV host Conan O'Brien rejects NBC's offer to switch his show's time slot}}
{{main|2010 Tonight Show conflict}}
In their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10pm weeknight time slot to 11:35pm, due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/future-for-nbcs-the-jay-leno-show-is-up-in-the-air.html "Future For NBC's Tonight Show Up In The Air"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 2010.</ref><ref name="access">[http://www.accesshollywood.com/jay-leno-heading-back-to-late-night-conan-obrien-weighing-options_article_27490 "Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O’Brien Weighing Options"].</ref> Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would be preempted by the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] between February 15 and 26. This would move ''The Tonight Show'' to 12:05am, a post-midnight timeslot for the first time in its history. O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show back to 12:05&nbsp;a.m. without penalty (a clause put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).<ref>[[Nikki Finke|Finke, Nikki]] (January 7, 2010).

On January 10, NBC confirmed that they would move Jay Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and intended to move him to late night as soon as possible.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20100112215828 |url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/01/nbc-press-tour-executive-session-live-blog.html |title=NBC confirms move of "Leno Show"}}</ref><ref name="nyt">[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/update-nbc-plans-leno-at-1130-conan-at-12/ "Update: NBC Plans Leno at 11:30, Conan at 12"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 7, 2010.</ref> [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that O'Brien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him two choices: an hour-long 12:05am time slot, or the option to leave the network.<ref name="tmz">[http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/08/conan-obrien-jay-leno-nbc-tonight-show/ "NBC to Conan O'Brien – The Choice Is Yours"], [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], January 8, 2010.</ref> On January 12, O'Brien issued a press release that stated he would not continue with ''Tonight'' if it moved to a 12:05am time slot,<ref name="msnbc11210">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34827830/ns/entertainment-television Conan Won't Do "The Tonight Show" Following Leno], ''MSNBC.com'', January 12, 2010.</ref> saying, "I believe that delaying ''The Tonight Show'' into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. ''The Tonight Show'' at 12:05 simply isn't ''The Tonight Show.''"

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien. It was decided that O'Brien would leave ''The Tonight Show''. The deal was made that O'Brien would receive a $33 million payout and that his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure. O'Brien's final episode aired on Friday, January 22, 2010.<ref>Robert Seidman

''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''</ref> Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno's autobiography ''Leading with My Chin'', told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "The thing Leno should do is walk, period.

He'll be viewed as the bad guy."<ref name="latimes11510-2">[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story?page=2 "Taking on America's 'nice guy{{'"}}]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. p. 2.</ref>

In addition to criticism about his handling of the timeslot conflict, Leno has also been criticized for the perceived change in the content of his monologues from his previous stand-up material. Actor and comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] was among the celebrities who openly voiced disappointment with Leno, saying, "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks'; it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation... willfully has shut the switch off."<ref name="huffpost">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/11/patton-oswalt-weighs-in-o_n_419015.html "Patton Oswalt: Jay Leno Is Like Nixon, I Don't Like Him"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.</ref>

===Support for Leno===
[[NBC Sports]] chairman and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Dick Ebersol]] spoke out against all who had mocked Leno, calling them "chicken-hearted and gutless".<ref name="latimes11510">[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story "Taking on America's 'nice guy{{'"}}].

Jeff Gaspin, then chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, also defended Leno, saying, "This has definitely crossed the line. Jay Leno is the consummate professional and one of the hardest-working people in television. It's a shame that he's being pulled into this."<ref name="latimes11510-2" />

Fellow comedians [[Paul Reiser]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]] (a frequent contributor to ''The Tonight Show'') also voiced support for Leno.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-reiser/a-teachable-leno-moment_b_418197.html "Paul Reiser: A Teachable Moment"].

Leno owns approximately 286 vehicles (169 automobiles and 117 motorcycles).<ref>[http://www.jaylenosgarage.com/the-cars/ The Cars], jaylenosgarage.com</ref> He also has a website called "[[Jay Leno's Garage]]," which contains video clips and photos of his automobiles in detail, as well as other vehicles of interest to him.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.jaylenosgarage.com|title = Jay Leno's Garage|work = Official Website}}</ref> Leno's Garage Manager is Bernard Juchli.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://totalcarmagazine.com/features/2013/04/06/ja_leno_garage_pt1/|title = Which way to Jay Leno’s Garage?}}</ref>  Among his collection are two [[Doble steam car]]s, a sedan and a roadster that were owned by [[Howard Hughes]], and one of nine remaining 1963 [[Chrysler Turbine Car]]s.

He has a regular column in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' which showcases his car collection and gives advice about various automotive topics, including restoration and unique models, such as his jet-powered motorcycle and solar-powered hybrid. Leno also writes occasional "Motormouth" articles for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/article1746609.ece|title=Jay Leno's million dollar garage|publisher=The Times|date=May 9, 2007 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Moran}}</ref> reviewing high-end sports cars and giving his humorous take on automotive matters.

Leno opened his garage to [[Team Bondi]], the company that developed the critically acclaimed video-game ''[[L.A. Noire]]'', which is set in Los Angeles in the late 1940s. Leno's collection contained almost 100 cars from this period, and allowed the team to recreate their images as accurately as possible.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.giantbomb.com/la-noire/3030-21500/|title = L.
