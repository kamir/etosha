'''Robert Smigel''' (born February 7, 1960) is an American actor, humorist, comedian and writer known for his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' "[[TV Funhouse]]" cartoon shorts and as the [[puppeteer]] and voice behind [[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]].

==Early life==
Smigel was born in New York City. His father is Dr. [[Irwin Smigel]], DDS, "The Father of Cosmetic Dentistry",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Smigel.com |title=New York Cosmetic Dentistry with Dr. Irwin Smigel |publisher=Smigel.com |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> and the founder and president of the [[American Society for Dental Aesthetics]]. His mother is Lucia Smigel, president and CEO of Supersmile.<ref>https://www.supersmile.com/content/print/lucia-smigel-featured-in-march-magazine</ref> He is Jewish and frequently went to Jewish summer camp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/robert-smigel,14249/ |title=Interview:Rober Smigal |publisher=AVclub.com |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> He attended [[Cornell University]], studying pre-dental<ref>http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/robert-smigel-556-v17n10</ref> and graduated from [[New York University]] in 1983 with a degree in communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940109/robert_smigels_dog_days |title=Rolling Stone Magazine: Robert Smigel's Dog Days |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue10/10_culture_snl.html</ref>

Smigel began developing his comedic talent at [[The Players Workshop]] in Chicago, where he studied improvisation with [[Josephine Forsberg]]. Fellow students included [[Bob Odenkirk]]. Smigel was also a member of the Chicago comedy troupe "All You Can Eat" in the early 1980s.

==Career==
Smigel first established himself as a writer on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' by joining the writing staff when [[Lorne Michaels]] returned as executive producer for the 1985–1986 season. Smigel was hired after then-''SNL'' producers [[Al Franken]] and Tom Davis saw Smigel in a Chicago sketch show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23075 |title=Robert Smigel &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=August 4, 2004 |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> After the 1985–1986 season proved to be a disappointment with critics, in the ratings, and with [[Brandon Tartikoff]] (who was planning to have ''SNL'' canceled by the last episode of season 11 due to its sliding ratings),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/85/85r.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Anjelica Huston & Billy Martin: 05/24/86 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=May 24, 1986 |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> Michaels fired most of the cast and writers, retained the cast and writers who were standouts during the otherwise dismal season (Smigel being one of them), and hired new ones for the 1986–1987 season. This is when Smigel began to write more memorable sketches, including one where host [[William Shatner]] urged worshipful attendees at a ''[[Star Trek]]'' convention to "get a life." Smigel rarely appeared on screen; although, he was credited as a feature player in the early 1990s and has played a recurring character in the ''[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]'' sketches.

While on a writers' strike from ''Saturday Night Live'' following the 1987–88 season, Smigel wrote for an [[improvisational comedy]] revue in Chicago with fellow ''SNL'' writers [[Bob Odenkirk]] and [[Conan O'Brien]] called ''[[Happy Happy Good Show]]''.

Smigel co-wrote ''[[Lookwell]]'' with [[Conan O'Brien]] for NBC. The pilot never went to series, but it has become a cult hit and has screened live at "The Other Network", a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced by [[Un-Cabaret]], featuring live and taped intros by Smigel. Smigel later became the first head writer at ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', where he created numerous successful comedy bits, including one where Smigel performed only the lips of public figures which were superimposed on photos of the actual people. (This technique was pioneered on the ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'' cartoon series as a cost-saving measure, and was known as [[Syncro-Vox]].)

In 1996, Smigel wrote and performed on the short-lived ''[[The Dana Carvey Show|Dana Carvey Show]]'', a primetime [[sketch comedy]] program on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Despite its premature end, the show provided Smigel the opportunity to debut his first cartoon, ''[[The Ambiguously Gay Duo]]''. Upon the show's cancellation, Smigel continued developing more cartoon ideas the following summer and would begin airing them on ''Saturday Night Live'' under the ''[[TV Funhouse]]'' banner. Smigel would later claim, "My whole career came out of the impulse to do cartoons on ''The Dana Carvey Show''."<ref>Heisler, Steve [http://www.avclub.com/articles/dana-carvey-and-robert-smigel,29184/ Interview – Dana Carvey and Robert Smigel] [[AV Club]] (June 15, 2009).

Smigel's most famous creation, however, would be the foul-mouthed puppet [[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]], who mercilessly mocks celebrities and others in the style of a [[Borscht Belt]] comedian. This character debuted on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in February 1997 and would continue to make appearances on the show, as well as others, for many years to come.

Smigel continued to establish himself on ''Saturday Night Live'' by producing infamous, provocative, short animated segments under the title ''[[TV Funhouse]]'', which usually [[satire|satirizes]] public figures and popular culture. It spawned a TV show on [[Comedy Central]] featuring a mix of puppets, animation, and short sketches, although only eight episodes were aired (during the winter of 2000–2001). Smigel occasionally appears in films (usually alongside ''SNL'' veterans such as [[Adam Sandler]]). According to interviews, Smigel helped punch up the scripts for ''[[Little Nicky]]'' and the ''[[Wedding Singer]]''. Smigel acted alongside fellow ''SNL'' writer [[Bob Odenkirk]] in ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' as a nerd backstage at an [[Aerosmith]] concert. His contributions were uncredited.

No ''TV Funhouse'' segments were produced for the 2009–10 season of ''SNL'', and his future with the show is unknown.

Currently Smigel is working on an animated sitcom for Fox called ''Animals''. Fox has not made any official statement regarding the show. Additionally, Smigel played a gay mailman in the Adam Sandler film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' and Yari the Mechanic in the "Mister Softee"<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640888/</ref> episode of "[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]".

In 2000, he voiced a sage bulldog in "[[Little Nicky]]". Smigel, along with Adam Sandler and [[Judd Apatow]], wrote the script for the film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' in which Smigel played Yosi, an Israeli electronics salesman. Smigel is also one of the executive producers of the film which is a first for him despite his frequent collaborations with Sandler. Presently living in New York, he is the co-writer and executive producer of the new films ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' and ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]''.

Smigel has a wife, Michelle, and has a child with [[autism]]. They serve on the board of [[New York Collaborates for Autism]] (NYCA), a non-profit organization founded in 2003 to address the needs of individuals and families who are living with autism.<ref>http://www.nyc4a.org/boardofdirectors</ref>
