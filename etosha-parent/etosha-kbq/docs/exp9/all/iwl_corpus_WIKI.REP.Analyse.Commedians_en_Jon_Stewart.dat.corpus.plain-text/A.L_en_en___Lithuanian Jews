'''Lithuanian Jews''' or '''Litvaks''' are [[Jews]] with roots in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]: (present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Latvia]] and the northeastern [[Suwałki]] region of [[Poland]]).  The term is sometimes used to cover all [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who follow a "Lithuanian" ([[Ashkenazi]]c and non-[[Hasidic]]) style of life and learning, whatever their ethnic background.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[European Jewish Congress]]|title=The Jewish Community of Lithuania|url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/communities/lithuania.html|accessdate=2014-11-06}}</ref>  The area where Lithuanian Jews lived is often referred to as "Lita."<ref>{{cite web|last=Shapiro|first=Nathan|title=The Migration of Lithuanian Jews to the United States, 1880 – 1918, and the Decisions Involved in the Process, Exemplified by Five Individual Migration Stories|url=http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/colleges/hclas/geog/geog_shapirothesis2013.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2013}}</ref>

Lithuania was historically home to a large and influential Jewish community that was almost entirely eliminated during [[the Holocaust]] (see [[The Holocaust in Lithuania]]). Before [[World War II]], there were over 110 [[synagogue]]s and 10 [[yeshiva]]s in [[Vilnius]] (called Vilna by Jews) alone.<ref>[http://litvakai.mch.mii.lt/jerusalem/Default.htm Vilnius, Jerusalem of Lithuania]</ref> Before World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population was some 160,000, about 7% of the total population.<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005444 Lithuania]</ref> Vilnius (then Wilno in the [[Second Polish Republic]]) had a Jewish community of nearly 100,000, about 45% of the city's total population.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Vilnius.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour - Vilnius]</ref> About 4,000 Jews were counted in Lithuania during the 2005 census.<ref>[http://www.stat.gov.lt/en/pages/view/?id=1731&PHPSESSID=311ec85274c89154e6f4befbc159a0e8 Lithuanian population by ethnicity]</ref>

Quoting the research done by [[H. G. Adler]] into Poland during World War II called ''Theresienstadt 1941–1945'', there were '80,000 Jews conscripted into Poland's independent army prior to the German invasion who identified themselves as Lithuanian Jews'. Using different sources Holocaust researchers claim there were between 60,000–65,000 Jewish soldiers in Poland's independent army who identified themselves as Lithuanian Jews.<ref>http://www.holocaustsurvivors.org/data.show.php?di=record&da=encyclopedia&ke=27</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Yiddish]] adjective ''Litvish'' means "Lithuanian": the noun for a Lithuanian Jew is ''Litvak''. The term "Litvak" itself originates from "Litwak", a [[Polish language|Polish]] term denoting "a man from Lithuania", which however went out of use before the 19th century, only to be revived around 1880 in the narrower meaning of "a Lithuanian Jew".

Of the main [[Yiddish dialects]] in Europe, the [[Litvisher Yiddish|Litvishe Yiddish]] ([[Lithuanian Yiddish]]) dialect was spoken by [[Jews]] in Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and in the [[Suwałki region]] of northeastern Poland.

However, following the dispute between the Hasidim and the [[Misnagdim]], in which the Lithuanian academies were the heartland of opposition to Hasidism, "Lithuanian" came to have the connotation of Misnagdic (non-Hasidic) Judaism generally, and to be used for all Jews who follow the traditions of the great Lithuanian yeshivot whether or not their ancestors actually came from Lithuania.  In modern Israel ''Lita'im'' (Lithuanians) is often used for all [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews who are not [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] (and not [[Hardal]]im or [[Sephardic Haredim]]). Other expressions used for this purpose are ''[[Yeshivish]]e'' and ''[[Misnagdim]]''. Both the words ''Litvishe'' and ''Lita'im'' are somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from greater [[Lithuania]] and lots of Lithuanian Jews who are not Haredim. The term ''Misnagdim'' ("opponents") on the other hand is somewhat outdated, because the opposition between the two groups has lost much of its relevance. ''Yeshivishe'' is also problematic because Hasidim now make use of [[yeshiva|yeshivot]] as much as the Litvishe Jews.

==Ethnicity, religious customs and heritage==
The characteristically "Lithuanian" approach to [[Judaism]] was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual [[Talmud]] study. Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. Though outnumbered and named "misnagdim" (opposers) by the Hasidim, the Lithuanian traditionalists believed that their standard Rabbinic Judaism predated Hasidism and was Judaism in its original and authentic form. Differences between the groups grew to the extent that in popular perception "Lithuanian" and "[[Misnagdim|misnagged]]" became virtually interchangeable terms. However, a sizable minority of Lithuanian Jews belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including [[Chabad]], [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)]], [[Karlin (Hasidic dynasty)|Karlin]] ([[Pinsk]]) and [[Koidanov]]. With the spread of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], many Lithuanian Jews became devotees of the ''[[Haskala]]'' (Jewish Enlightenment) movement in [[Eastern Europe]] pressing for better integration into European society, and today many leading academics, scientists and philosophers are of Lithuanian Jewish descent.

The most famous Lithuanian institution of Jewish learning was [[Volozhin yeshiva]], which was the model for most later yeshivas.  Twentieth century "Lithuanian" yeshivas include [[Ponevezh yeshiva|Ponevezh]], [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Kelm Talmud Torah|Kelm]], and [[Hebron Yeshiva|Slabodka]], which bear the names of their Lithuanian forbears.  American "offspring" of the Lithuanian yeshiva movement include [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen]] ("Chofetz Chaim") and [[Beth Medrash Govoha]] ("Lakewood") as well as numerous other yeshivas founded by students of Lakewood's founder, Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]].

In theoretical Talmud study, the leading Lithuanian authorities were [[Chaim Soloveitchik]] and the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisker]] school; rival approaches were those of the Mir and Telshe yeshivas.  In practical [[halakha]] the Lithuanians traditionally followed the [[Aruch HaShulchan]], though today the "Lithuanian" yeshivas prefer the [[Mishnah Berurah]], which is regarded as both more analytic and more accessible.

In the 19th century, the Orthodox Ashkenazi residents of the Holy Land were broadly speaking divided into [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] and [[Perushim]], who were Lithuanian Jews influenced by the [[Vilna Gaon]]. For this reason, in modern day Israeli [[Haredi]] parlance the terms ''Litvak'' (noun) or ''Litvisher'' (adjective), or in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Litaim'', are often used loosely to include any non-[[Hasidic]] [[Ashkenazi]] Haredi individual or institution. Another reason for this broadening of the term is the fact that many of the leading Israeli Haredi [[yeshivas]] (outside the Hasidic camp) are successor bodies to the famous yeshivot of Lithuania, though their present-day members may or may not be descended from Lithuanian Jewry. In reality, both the ethnic makeup and the religious traditions of the [[misnagdim|misnagged]] communities are much more diverse.

==History==
{{main|History of the Jews in Lithuania}}
Jews began living in Lithuania as early as the 8th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In 1388 they were granted a charter by [[Vytautas]], under which they formed a class of freemen subject in all criminal cases directly to the jurisdiction of the grand duke and his official representatives, and in petty suits to the jurisdiction of local officials on an equal footing with the lesser nobles (''[[Lithuanian nobility|szlachta]]''), [[boyars]], and other free citizens. As a result, the community prospered.

In 1495 they were expelled by [[Alexander Jagiellon]], but allowed to return in 1503. The Lithuanian statute of 1566 placed a number of restrictions on the Jews, and imposed [[sumptuary laws]], including the requirement that they wear [[yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], including yellow caps for men and yellow kerchiefs for women.

The [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] destroyed the existing Lithuanian Jewish institutions. Still, the Jewish population of Lithuania grew from an estimated 120,000 in 1569 to approximately 250,000 in 1792. After the 1793 [[Second Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Lithuanian Jews became subjects of the [[Russian Empire]].

==Lithuanian Jews in the Second World War==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2014}} The Jewish Lithuanian population before [[World War II]] numbered around 160,000, or about 7% of the total population.<ref name="USHMM">"[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005444 Lithuania]" (updated June 20, 2014).

Retrieved 2015-04-14.</ref> by 1941 the Jewish population of Lithuania had swelled to approximately 250,000, or 10% of the total population.<ref name="USHMM"/> 

During the German invasion of June 1941, 206,800 Jews were murdered by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborators.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Notable execution locations were in the [[Paneriai]] woods (see [[Ponary massacre]]) and the [[Ninth Fort]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Culture==
Litvaks have an identifiable mode of pronouncing Hebrew and Yiddish; this is often used to determine the boundaries of '''Lita''' (area of settlement of Litvaks). Its most characteristic feature is the pronunciation of the vowel [[niqqud|holam]] as {{IPA|[ej]}} (as against Sephardic {{IPA|[oː]}}, Germanic {{IPA|[au]}} and Polish {{IPA|[oj]}}).

In the popular perception,{{by whom|date=November 2013}} Litvaks were considered to be more intellectual and stoic than their rivals, the [[Galician Jews|Galitzianers]], who thought of them as cold fish. They, in turn, disdained Galitzianers as irrational and uneducated. Ira Steingroot's "Yiddish Knowledge Cards" devote a card to this "Ashkenazi version of the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|Hatfields and McCoys]]."<ref>[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13727/edition_id/265/format/html/displaystory.html "Yiddish Knowledge Cards"]</ref>  This difference is of course connected with the Hasidic/misnagged debate, Hasidism being considered the more emotional and spontaneous form of religious expression.

The two groups differed not only in their attitudes and their pronunciation, but also in their [[Jewish cuisine|cuisine]]. The Galitzianers were known for rich, heavily sweetened dishes in contrast to the plainer, more savory Litvisher versions, with the boundary known as the "[[Gefilte Fish]] Line."<ref>[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12012/format/html/displaystory.html This is no fish tale: Gefilte tastes tell story of ancestry]</ref>

==Genetics==
The Lithuanian Jewish population may exhibit a genetic [[founder effect]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1216062|title=A Population-Genetic Test of Founder Effects and Implications for Ashkenazi Jewish Diseases|publisher=[[American Society of Human Genetics]] via [[PubMed]]|pmid=15208782|doi=10.1086/423146|volume=75|issue=2|date=August 2004|journal=Am. J. Hum.

==Jews in Lithuania today==
Interest among descendants of Lithuanian Jews has spurred tourism and a renewal in research and preservation of the community's historic resources and possessions. Increasing numbers of Lithuanian Jews are interested in learning and practising the use of Yiddish.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6303057.stm Lithuanian Jews revive Yiddish]</ref>

The beginning of the 21st century was marked by conflicts between members of Chabad-Lubavitch and secular leaders. In 2005, Chief Rabbi Sholom Ber Krinsky was physically removed from the Synagogue by two men hired by the community's secular leader Mr. Alperovich, who then declared a new [[Chief Rabbi]].<ref>[http://vilnius.usembassy.gov/Text/Docs/HumanR/IRF2005.htm International Religious Freedom Report]</ref> For more detail, see [[Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies#Lithuania|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies: Lithuania]].

Among notable contemporary Lithuanian Jews are the brothers [[Emanuelis Zingeris]] (a member of the Lithuanian [[Seimas]]) and [[Markas Zingeris]] (writer), Anatolijus Šenderovas (world-renowned composer, Laureate of the Lithuanian National Award and European Composer's Prize winner), [[Arturas Bumsteinas]] (composer, sound artist), [[Arkadijus Vinokuras]] (actor, publicist), Gercas Žakas (football referee), [[Gidonas Šapiro]]-Bilas (pop-singer from [[ŽAS]]), [[Dovydas Bluvšteinas]] (music producer), [[Leonidas Donskis]] (philosopher, essayist), [[Icchokas Meras]] (writer), Benjaminas Gorbulskis,  [[Chaim Baruch Utinsky]] ([[poet]])), Grigorijus Kanovičius (writer), Rafailas Karpis ([[opera]] singer ([[tenor]])), [[David Geringas]] (world-renowned [[cellist]] and [[conducting|conductor]]), Liora Grodnikaitė ([[opera]] singer ([[mezzo-soprano]])), Arkadijus Gotesmanas )Jazz percussionist), [[Ilja Bereznickas]] ([[animator]], [[illustrator]], [[scriptwriter]] and [[caricaturist]]),Adomas Jacovskis, Marius Jacovskis, Aleksandra Jacovskytė (painters),Adasa Skliutauskaitė (painter), etc.

45.6% of Lithuanian Jews had tertiary education in 2001, while the percentage of Lithuanians with tertiary education was 22.6%.<ref>[http://www.stat.gov.lt/uploads/42_Lietuvos_gyventojai.pdf Statistics]</ref>{{deadlink|date=July 2014}}
