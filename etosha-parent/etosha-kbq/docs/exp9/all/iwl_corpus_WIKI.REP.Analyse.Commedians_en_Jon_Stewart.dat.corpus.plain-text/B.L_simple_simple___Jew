A '''Jew''' is a person who is of Jewish [[Wikt:heritage|heritage]] or who has converted to the [[Jewish religion]]. Jews typically consider themselves as a people, and not only as adherents of a religion, therefore a Jew is not only one that practices the religion of [[Judaism]], but it is also one who is of Jewish heritage. According to traditional Jewish law, the [[Halakha]], someone is Jewish if their mother was a Jew or if they have converted to Judaism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dosick |first=Wayne |title=Living Judaism |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-062179-6 |page=56-57}}</ref>  Judaism has been described as a religion, a race, a culture, a nation, and an extended family.<ref name=Jewfaq1>{{cite web|title=Judaism 101: What is Judaism?|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm|website=JewFAQ.org|publisher=Judaism 101|accessdate=18 December 2014|language=Standard English|quote=• Judaism has been described as a religion, a race, a culture, and a nation • All of these descriptions have some validity • The Jewish people are best described as an extended family}}</ref>

[[Israel]] is the only Jewish country, but there are Jewish minorities in many places in the world. Most of them live in large cities in the [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]].  Both [[Israel]] and the [[U.S.]] have over five million Jews.<ref name="JPPI2007">{{cite study |title=Annual Assessment |url=http://www.jpppi.org.il/JPPPI/SendFile.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&GID=489 |year=2007 |publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]]) |page=15 |format=PDF}}, based on {{cite book |title=American Jewish Year Book |publisher=[[American Jewish Committee]] |url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php?GroupingId=10142 |volume=106 |year=2006}}</ref> In the [[Soviet Union]] there were more than two million Jews, but many of them moved to Israel, the U.S. and other Western countries since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 
Jews have been victims of various [[persecution]]s. One of the most well known happened during the [[Second World War]], when almost six million Jews were killed by the [[Nazis]]. It is known as [[the Holocaust]].

== Jewish ethnic groups ==
There are Jewish [[ethnic group]]s. The two biggest are called [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] (originally from Central and Eastern Europe) and Sephardic (originally from the lands around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], particularly Spain and Portugal). In Israel, those from Arab and Muslim countries are called Mizrahi Jews. There are also African Jews (Beta Israel), Indian Jews (Bene Israel) and some Chinese Jews (Kai-feng Jews).  Many of these groups have moved from one place to another.  For example, many Ashkenazi Jews live in the United States, and many Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews live in France.<ref name=EJ572>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schmelz |first=Usiel Oscar |coauthors=Sergio DellaPergola |editor=Fred Skolnik |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |title=Demography |edition=2d ed. |year=2007 |publisher=Thomson Gale |volume=5 |location=Farmington Hills, Mich. |isbn=0-02-865928-2 |pages=571–572 }}</ref>

Jews speak the languages of the countries where they live. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the  language of Judaism because it is the language in which the Bible was written. It is still used for prayers. In Israel, Ivrit, which is the name for the new Hebrew language, is the common language. There are also old Jewish languages such as [[Yiddish]] and [[Ladino language|Ladino]] which are still spoken and written by some Jews.
