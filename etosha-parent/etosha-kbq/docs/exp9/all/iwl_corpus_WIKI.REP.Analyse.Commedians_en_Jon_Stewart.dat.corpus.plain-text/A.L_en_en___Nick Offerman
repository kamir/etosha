==Career==
[[File:Nick Offerman Sundance 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Offerman at the 2014 Sundance Awards Ceremony]]
Offerman lived in Chicago in the mid-1990s, where he participated with theatre companies such as [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf]], [[Goodman Theatre|Goodman]], and Wisdom Bridge. At Steppenwolf, he also worked as a [[fight choreographer]] and [[carpenter (theatre)|master carpenter]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Erik |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/showrunner-michael-schur-on-building-parks-and-rec,81611/2/ |title=Showrunner Michael Schur on building Parks And Recreation’s fourth season (Part 4 of 5) &#124; TV &#124; The Walkthrough |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref> During this time, Offerman became acquainted with [[Amy Poehler]], who was heavily involved with the Chicago [[improvisational theatre|improv comedy]] scene.<ref name="MRyan">{{Cite news |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |title=Nick Offerman serves up solid comedy on "Parks and Recreation" |date=2009-09-23 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/09/parks-and-recreation-nick-offerman.html |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

In 2003, he married ''[[Will & Grace]]'' actress [[Megan Mullally]] and has also appeared on her [[talk show]], ''[[The Megan Mullally Show]]''. At the same time, he began appearing on television: as a plumber on ''Will & Grace'' during its fourth season's [[Thanksgiving]] episode, on ''[[The King of Queens]]'' as a hobo, in three episodes of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', and in an episode of ''[[The West Wing]]''. Prior to ''Parks and Recreation'', his most prominent role was as factory worker and [[Benny Lopez|Benny-Lopez]]-love-interest Randy McGee on ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''. He appeared twice on ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', in 2003's "The Festival of Living Art" and 2005's "Always a Godmother, Never a God". Offerman played would-be assassin of [[Wild Bill Hickok]], Tom Mason, in an early episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' and in the third-season episode of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', "Mr. Monk and the Election" as a helper for the campaign of Natalie Teeger.  In 2007, Offerman co-starred in the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[American Body Shop]]''.

In 2009, ''Office'' producers [[Michael Schur]] and [[Greg Daniels]] offered Offerman a regular supporting role in their [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'': that of [[Ron Swanson]], the deadpan, government-hating head of a city parks department and boss of [[Amy Poehler]]'s character [[Leslie Knope]].<ref name="MRyan" /> ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine declared Offerman "''Parks and Recreation<nowiki>'</nowiki>''s secret weapon", and said he regularly stole scenes and "has a gift for understated physical comedy".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Weiner |first=Jonah |title=You Really Should Be Watching ''Parks and Recreation'' |date=2009-12-02 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2237077/ |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref> The role weaves antagonism and political philosophy with humanity, while the intense [[libertarian]] philosophy the character lives out is often played off against the equally intense liberalism and 'do-gooder' mentality of Poehler's character.  Offerman said that supporting parts such as that of ''Parks and Recreation'' are his ideal roles, and that he draws particular inspiration from Reverend [[Jim Ignatowski]], the character played by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in the sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''.<ref name="MRyan" />

Offerman has also been featured in the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'' with [[Rob Corddry]] and [[Rob Huebel]]. He is the voice of Axe Cop in the animated series of the [[Axe Cop (TV series)|same name]] that premiered on July 27, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screencrush.com/fox-axe-cop-cast-premiere-date/ |title=FOX RELEASES ‘AXE COP’ VOICE CAST, SETS SATURDAY ANIMATION DOMINATION HD PREMIERE |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |date=January 8, 2013 |website=ScreenCrush |publisher= |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref> In the same year, Offerman portrayed [[Johnny Cool]] in the "Boston" episode of [[Derek Waters]]' ''[[Drunk History]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].

Additionally, he starred and produced an independent film, ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (2012 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'' (2012), shot in Austin, Texas. He appeared in the 2013 comedy ''[[We're the Millers]]'', which starred [[Jason Sudeikis]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]], and voiced Metalbeard in ''[[The Lego Movie]]''. Offerman conceived of and starred in punk band [[FIDLAR]]'s 2013 video for their song "Cocaine".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/how-punk-band-fidlar-recruited-592622|title=How Punk Band FIDLAR Recruited 'Parks and Rec' Star Nick Offerman for NSFW Video (Q&A)|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref> Offerman also played an alcoholic college guidance counselor in ''[[Believe Me (film)|Believe Me]]'' (2014).
