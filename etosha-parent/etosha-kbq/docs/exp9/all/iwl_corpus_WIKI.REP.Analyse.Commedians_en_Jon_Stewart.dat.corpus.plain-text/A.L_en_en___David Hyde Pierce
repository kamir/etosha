'''David Hyde Pierce''' (born April 3, 1959)<ref name=rootsweb /> is an American actor and comedian. Pierce is known for playing the psychiatrist [[Niles Crane|Dr. Niles Crane]] on the hit [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', for which he won four [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Awards]] during the show's run.

==Early life==
Pierce was born '''David Pierce''' in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. His father, George Hyde Pierce, was an aspiring actor, and his mother, Laura Marie (née Hughes), was an insurance agent.<ref name=rootsweb>{{cite web|title=David Hyde Pierce profile|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/pierce.htm|publisher=Rootsweb|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> He added his middle name "Hyde" to avoid confusion with another actor named David Pierce.<ref>"I did not come out of the womb with the name 'Hyde'. It was my middle name  from my dad's side of the family. His mom's maiden name. So when our film union said there was already a David Pierce, I added the name 'Hyde'", interview with [[Cindy Adams]], ''New York Post'', June 29, 2011</ref>

As a child, Pierce frequently played organ at the local [[Bethesda Episcopal Church (Saratoga Springs)|Bethesda Episcopal Church]].<ref>Barbara S Wilson, Arlene Flancher, and Susan T. Erdey, ''The Episcopal Handbook'' (Moorhouse [Church] Publishing 2008), pp. 106-7, ISBN 978-0-8192-2329-6.</ref>

While attending Yale, Pierce performed in and directed student productions, appearing in the Yale [[Gilbert & Sullivan]] Society's production of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''. He also directed the Gilbert & Sullivan Society's operetta ''[[Princess Ida]]''.<ref>Rizzo, Frank.

Among other roles Pierce played at Yale were in  ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]''.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

==Career==
After his graduation, Pierce moved to [[New York City]], where during the 1980s and early 1990s he was employed in various jobs, such as selling ties at [[Bloomingdale's]] and working as a security guard, while pursuing an acting career and studying at [[Michael Howard Studios]]. During this period he played Laertes in a popular off-Broadway production of ''[[Hamlet]],'' and made his Broadway debut in 1982 in [[Christopher Durang]]'s ''[[Beyond Therapy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=79363 |title=Profile at IBDb |publisher=Ibdb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref>

Pierce's first big television break came in the early 1990s with [[Norman Lear]]'s political comedy, ''[[The Powers That Be (TV series)|The Powers That Be]],'' in which Pierce played Theodore, a Congressman.<ref name="showperson">{{cite web|title=Showperson; the DHP Website|url=http://davidhydepierce.org/biography.html| accessdate=2008-06-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080602003242/http://davidhydepierce.org/biography.html|archivedate=2008-06-02}}</ref> Despite positive reviews from critics, the show was canceled after a brief run.

In part due to his close physical resemblance to [[Kelsey Grammer]],<ref name="allinthefamily"/> the producers of the ''[[Cheers]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Frasier]]'' created the role of [[Niles Crane]] ([[Frasier Crane]]'s younger brother) for him.<ref name="showperson"/> Although prior to ''Frasier'' going into production, Pierce had petitioned the [[Screen Actors Guild]] to change his [[billing (filmmaking)|billing]] to David Pierce, the name he had used on the stage, the use of his middle name in the show's credits helped reinforce the actor's and the character's "snooty" image.<ref name="allinthefamily">{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=All In Their Family|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/01/entertainment/ca-24256|date=1998-03-01|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> For his work on ''Frasier'', Pierce was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] a record eleven consecutive years, winning in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2004.

Pierce also appeared alongside [[Jodie Foster]] in ''[[Little Man Tate]]'', with [[Anthony Hopkins]] in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', and with [[Ewan McGregor]] in ''[[Down With Love]]''.<ref name="showperson"/> He provided the voice for Doctor Doppler in [[Disney]]'s 42nd animated feature, ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', Slim, a [[Phasmatodea|stick insect]] in [[Pixar]]'s ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and [[Abe Sapien]] in [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''. In 2001, he starred in the cult 1980s summer camp comedy ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' as the befuddled astrophysicist, Prof. Henry Newman. In his role in ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', Pierce played the brother of Meg Ryan's character, a professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The movie was released just three months before the start of ''Frasier''.<ref name="showperson"/>

In 2005, Pierce joined [[Tim Curry]] and others in the stage production of ''[[Spamalot]]''.<ref name="showperson"/> In August and September 2006, he starred as ''Lieutenant Frank Cioffi'' in ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]'', a new Kander and Ebb musical staged at the Ahmanson Theatre in [[Los Angeles]]. In March 2007, ''Curtains'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]<ref name="showperson"/> and on June 10, 2007 Pierce won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]] at the 61st [[Tony Award]]s for his performance.<ref name="showperson"/> In his acceptance speech, Pierce said the first words he spoke on a Broadway stage were, "I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=David Hyde Pierce Acceptance Speech Tony Award|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4yXtF8Tb8|work=YouTube|year=2007|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>

On November 19, 2007, Pierce was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] Degree from [[Niagara University]] in [[Lewiston, New York]].  In 1999 he was awarded an Honorary Degree from [[Skidmore College]], located in his native Saratoga Springs. In 2010, Pierce appeared in a revival of [[David Hirson]]'s play ''[[La Bête]]'' directed by [[Matthew Warchus]].  The production debuted on London's West End before moving to New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rylance, Lumley and Hyde Pierce bring La Bête to West End|url=http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/news/latest/view/item109640/Rylance%252C-Lumley-and-Hyde-Pierce-bring-La-B%25EAte-to-West-End-|work=London, UK|year=2010|accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> Also in 2010, Pierce had his first starring film role as Warwick Wilson in the dark comedy/psychological thriller ''[[The Perfect Host]]''.

===Voice acting===
[[File:David Hyde Pierce at the 1995 Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Pierce at the Governor's Ball dinner after the Emmy Awards in September 1995]]
Pierce is known for his distinctive voice and, like his ''[[Frasier]]'' co-star, Kelsey Grammer, is often called upon to provide voice work. His notable roles include the narrator of the movie ''[[The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human]]'' in 1999, [[Phasmatodea|walking stick insect]] Slim in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', Doctor Delbert Doppler in Disney's film ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', and the amphibian [[Abe Sapien]] in ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''.<ref name="showperson"/> Pierce refused credit for his ''Hellboy'' role because he felt it was the performance of [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], and not his own voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life.<ref>{{cite interview|subject=Doug Jones|interviewer=Staci Layne|url=http://www.horror.com/php/article-1596-1.html|format=transcript|program=''Horror.com''|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''.

In a deliberate [[in-joke]], he voiced [[Cecil bob|Cecil]], the brother of [[Kelsey Grammer]]-voiced [[Sideshow Bob]], in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Brother from Another Series]]", in which the two characters parallel the Frasier-Niles relationship. At one point in the episode, Cecil mistakes Bart for [[Maris Crane|Maris]], the unseen wife of Niles on ''Frasier''. He returned as Cecil in the Season 19 episode "[[Funeral for a Fiend]]" where ''[[Frasier]]'' co-star [[John Mahoney]] (who starred as [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] and [[Niles Crane|Niles']] father in the show) voices Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr., the father of Cecil and Sideshow Bob. 

Pierce provided the voice of Mr. Daedalus in the 1998 Disney show ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]''. In 2006, he co-starred in the animated pilot for ''[[The Amazing Screw-On Head]]'' as the Screw-On Head's nemesis Emperor Zombie; however, the series was not picked up. His commercial voiceover work included ads for the [[Tassimo]] coffee system, Seattle's Metro Transit, and home furnishings retailer [[IKEA]] Canada.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9lyydAbWiY|title=IKEA Pax: Our Pre-Wedding Photographer Lives in Advertising|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2011-06-08|accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref>

Pierce also narrated a 2-CD tour guide "[[Napa Uncorked]]" in 2002. <ref>CDroam</ref>

After years of media speculation about his sexuality, Pierce [[coming out|came out]] in 2007 and later confirmed through his publicist that he and television writer, director and producer [[Brian Hargrove]] were a couple.<ref>{{cite news|author=The Associated Press|title='Frasier' brother finds home on stage|work=CNN|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629112910/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/05/30/theater.davidhydepierce.ap/index.html|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/05/30/theater.davidhydepierce.ap/index.html|archivedate=2007-06-29|date=May 30, 2007|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= David Hyde Pierce joins list of out gay actors|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2007/5/davidhydepierce|work=AfterElton|date=May 30, 2007|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> When accepting his Tony Award for ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]'', Pierce thanked "my partner, Brian, because it's 24 years of listening to your damn notes—that's why I'm up here tonight."<ref>{{cite news|title=Rants & Raves|work=The Advocate|pages=26, issue 989|date=July 17, 2007}}</ref> They married in California on October 24, 2008, just days before [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] was adopted as law, banning [[same-sex marriage]]s in the state.<ref>Show Person: the David Hyde Pierce website</ref> On May 28, 2009, while a guest on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', he publicly announced his marriage to Hargrove and expressed his anger about the approval of Proposition 8.<ref>AP staff report, "David Hyde Pierce says he married longtime partner," May 29, 2009.
