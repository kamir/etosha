'''Robert William "Rob" Corddry''' (born February 4, 1971) is an American actor and comedian. He is known for his work as a [[correspondent]] on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' (2002–2006) and for his starring role in the comedy film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'' (2010). He is also the creator and star of the [[Adult Swim]] comedy series ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'' and won his first and second [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]s in September 2012 and September 2013.

==Early life==
Corddry was born and raised in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]]. He is the son of Robin (née Sullivan) and Steven Corddry, who was a [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] official.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/05/01/a_bald_liar/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Paul | last=Rogers | title=A Bald Liar | date=May 1, 2005}}</ref><ref>[http://www.umassmag.com/Fall_2005/Class_Clown_940.html UMass Magazine Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He is the older brother of actor [[Nate Corddry]]. Corddry and his brother are both [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scouts]] from Troop 19, located in Weymouth.<ref name="cordddryeagle">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/25/entertainment/la-et-performance25-2010mar25|title=The Performance: Rob Corddry|last=Ordoña|first=Michael|date=March 25, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref><ref name="corddreagle2">{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/rob_cordry_actor.php|title=Rob Corddry, Hot Tub Time Machine|last=Del Signore|first=John|date=March 25, 2010|publisher=Gothamist|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref>

After graduating from Weymouth North High School (1989), Corddry went to the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1989–93). According to an interview in the UMass Amherst [[alumnus|alumni]] magazine, Corddry initially planned to major in journalism; but he stuck with it for just two days. English became his official major; but, by his second year, he focused much of his attention on Drama classes and plays including ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]'', ''[[And Then There Were None|Ten Little Indians]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Reckless (play)|Reckless]]''. While at UMass, Corddry pledged the Theta Chapter of [[Theta Chi]] fraternity.

In January 1994, Corddry moved to New York City. His early paying jobs included working as a security guard at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]<ref>{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Rob Corddry | series = [[Anytime with Bob Kushell]] | airdate = 2009-02-12 | season = 1 | number = 9}}</ref> and handing out menus for a [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] restaurant. He eventually landed acting jobs, including a year-long tour with the [[National Shakespeare Conservatory|National Shakespeare Company]]. He trained in [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York City, performing regularly as a member of the [[sketch comedy]] group "The Naked Babies" (with [[John Ross Bowie]], [[Brian Huskey]], and [[Seth Morris]]); and he spent two years with the sketch comedy group [[Third Rail Comedy]]. Corddry's first notable television appearances were on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' (1998–2000).

==''The Daily Show''==
In Spring 2002, he was asked to audition for ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and was accepted. His pieces for ''The Daily Show'' frequently included references to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which he considers to be his hometown. On October 4, 2005, his younger brother [[Nate Corddry]] made his first appearance as a ''Daily Show'' [[journalist|correspondent]]. On January 12, 2006, Corddry's wife Sandra appeared with him on a ''Daily Show'' segment; they welcomed their first child, daughter Sloane Sullivan Corddry, on July 3, 2006. On February 9, 2006 Corddry hosted an episode of ''The Daily Show'' due to the absence of [[Jon Stewart]] (jokingly because the show's regular host was "[[Plastic surgery|in the shop]]", but in fact because of the birth of Stewart's second child).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On August 15, 2006, Corddry said "I've got like a week and a half left, all bets are off", and then on August 21, 2006, Stewart remarked that Corddry's last day on ''The Daily Show'' would be August 24, 2006. Corddry appeared throughout the week, once filing a report from inside a toilet bowl supposedly on board an aircraft transporting [[John Mark Karr]], and another dressed up in a [[1970s in fashion|1970s fashion]]; Stewart remarked, "It's his last week, and really, we're trying to come up with terrible things for him to have to do."

During that last show on August 24, Corddry aired a self-produced [[tribute]] to his four years on the show, going out, as Stewart said, with a "[[Toilet humour|poop joke]]".

:Stewart: ''That was a very fitting tribute, Rob. We're gonna miss you on the show.''
:Corddry: ''Why thank you, Jon. But wherever I go and whatever I do, there'll always be a part of me here.''
:Stewart: ''Wow...that's a really sweet thing to say.''
:Corddry: ''No no no, I'm not kidding. It's in the second floor men's room, actually. That's what you get for not giving me a proper send off.''
:Stewart: ''You're really gonna go out on a poop joke?''
:Corddry: ''I have to stay true to myself, Jon.''

Corddry left ''The Daily Show'' to work on other projects, including ''[[The Winner (TV series)|The Winner]]'', a 2007 TV series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/category/the-daily-show|title=Television News, Reviews and TV Show Recaps - HuffPost TV|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>

On September 10, 2007, Corddry made a guest return to ''The Daily Show'' as the senior public restroom correspondent, in regard to the Senator [[Larry Craig scandal]].

On October 17, 2007, Corddry made a cameo appearance as himself at a rehab center that [[Samantha Bee]] was filming a report in.

On June 12, 2008, Corddry appeared again as the "Senior [[Lipizzaner]] Correspondent", reporting on Bush's trip to [[Slovenia]]. The skit ended by him asking, "You think you gonna do more Lipizzaner stories soon, or..? Because if not, I'd love to come home, you know? See my family—hear my wife is pregnant, so..." He added that he had "been gone two years, give or take." Jon made him stay.<ref>[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-june-12-2008/state-and-mane The Daily Show with Jon Stewart], June 12, 2008</ref>

On March 5, 2009, Corddry appeared again, discussing his own career since ''The Daily Show'' in parody of Mark Cooper's descent from an executive to a janitor.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/us/01survival.html?pagewanted=all</ref>  It was revealed that he had distracted [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] and stolen his piece, as he had come back to beg for his old job back.
