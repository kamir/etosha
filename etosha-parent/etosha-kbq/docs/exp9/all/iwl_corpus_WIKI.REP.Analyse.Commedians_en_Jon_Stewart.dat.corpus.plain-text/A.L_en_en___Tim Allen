[[Seaholm High School]] in Birmingham, where he was in theater and music classes (resulting in his love of classical piano). He then attended [[Central Michigan University]] and transferred to [[Western Michigan University]] in 1974.<ref name="honorary">{{cite web|title=WMU awards Tim Allen honorary degree|url=http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/1998/9806/9798-338.html|publisher=Western Michigan University|accessdate=June 12, 2010|date=June 27, 1998}}</ref> At Western Michigan, Allen worked at the student radio station [[WIDR]] and received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in communications specializing in radio and television production in 1976 with a split minor in philosophy and design.<ref name="Bio timeline">{{cite web|title=Tim Allen: Actor: Biography|url=http://www.timallen.com/actor/bio.php|website=timAllen.com|accessdate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> In 1998, Western Michigan awarded Allen an honorary Fine Arts degree and the Distinguished Alumni Award.<ref name="honorary"/>

==Career==
Allen started his career as a comedian in 1975.<ref name="actors"/> On a dare from one of his friends, he participated in a comedy night at Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle in Royal Oak, a suburb of Detroit. While in Detroit he began to get recognition appearing in local television commercials and appearing on cable comedy shows such as Gary Thison's ''Some Semblance of Sanity''. He later moved to Los Angeles and became a regular performer at [[The Comedy Store]]. He began to do stand-up appearances on late-night talk shows and specials on record and film.<ref name="actors"/>

Despite his admitted limited acting range (he once told a magazine his range as an actor is "strictly limited. I can only play a part if I can draw on personal experience, and that well can go dry pretty quickly"),<ref>{{cite news |title= Tim Allen: 'Home' is where the heart is |date= April–May 1996 |url= http://www.midtod.com/9603/allen.phtml |magazine= Midwest Today Magazine |accessdate= May 31, 2013}}</ref> Allen rose to fame in acting with the television series ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' (1991–1999) produced for ABC by Wind Dancer Productions, a company he co-founded with producer [[Carmen Finestra]].  Allen played [[Tim Taylor (character)|Tim "The Tool-Man" Taylor]].<ref name="actors"/> During one week in November 1994, he simultaneously starred in the highest grossing film (''[[The Santa Clause]]''), topped the ''New York Times'' best-seller list with his book ''Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man'', and appeared in the top rated television series (''Home Improvement'').<ref name="actors"/> The following year, he provided the voice of [[Buzz Lightyear]] in the blockbuster ''[[Toy Story]]''.<ref name="actors"/> Simultaneous with his time acting in ''Home Improvement'', Allen formed a race team with [[Steve Saleen]] and race driver [[Bob Bondurant]], called the Saleen/Allen "RRR" Speedlab. The team raced [[Saleen]] Mustangs in the [[SCCA World Challenge]], with Allen and Saleen as the team's drivers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1997 he starred in the family comedy ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'' from Disney. The film was poorly received by critics. The next year marked the final year of Home Improvement, for which he was paid $1.25 million per episode. The next year he returned to voice [[Buzz Lightyear]] in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' which was a financial and critical hit. Also in 2000 he starred in the sci-fi parody ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' alongside [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alan Rickman]] and [[Sam Rockwell]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2006, ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'' was released, featuring Allen as Jack Shepard. The same year, he also starred in ''[[The Santa Clause 3]]'' and ''[[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Allen began narrating the "[[Pure Michigan]]" television and radio commercials for the "Travel Michigan" agency. These commercials can be seen and heard throughout the [[Midwest]] and began airing nationally in 2009.<ref name="Pure Michigan Blog">{{cite web|title=Tim Allen and Pure Michigan|url=http://www.michigan.org/blog/pure-michigan-ads/pure-michigan-tim-allen/|website=michigan.org|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref>

In December 2009 he started a preview tour of ''[[Crazy on the Outside]]'', a film that debuted in January 2010. Allen accompanied the film, helping promote it with a series of stand-up acts beforehand. During the performances he told audiences that he planned a 2010 comedy tour. Allen also directed the film, marking his film directorial debut.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.timallen.com/?xpt=1|title = Stand Up and Show It Tour Dates|publisher=TimAllen.com}}</ref>
