==Early life==
Carlson was born '''Tucker McNear Carlson''' in San Francisco, California. He grew up in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], a suburb north of San Diego.

==Career==
Carlson began his [[journalism]] career as a member of the editorial staff of ''[[Policy Review]]'', a national [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] journal then published by the [[Heritage Foundation]] (and since acquired by the [[Hoover Institution]]).  He later worked as a reporter at the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'' newspaper in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and at ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''.

As a magazine and newspaper journalist, Carlson has reported from around the world. He has been a columnist for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]''. He has also written for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.

Carlson joined CNN as its youngest anchor ever, remaining at the network until February 2005. Carlson got his television start in 2000 as co-host of ''The Spin Room'' opposite [[Bill Press]].

===CNN's ''Crossfire''===
He later was appointed co-host of ''Crossfire'', where he represented the political [[right-wing politics|right]]. During the same period, Carlson also hosted a weekly public affairs program on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], ''Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered''.

==== Interview with Jon Stewart ====
One of Carlson's most memorable appearances on ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' was his 2004 heated exchange with [[Jon Stewart]], host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]], prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. Stewart criticized the format of shows like ''Crossfire'', calling Carlson and co-host [[Paul Begala]] "partisan hacks", and asked them to "stop hurting America".

Carlson countered by criticizing Stewart's July 2004 interview with then U.S. Presidential candidate [[John Kerry]]. He accused Stewart of "sniffing Kerry's throne" and "not asking tough questions." Stewart replied, contextualizing his own show as a comedic rather than journalistic venue, "It's interesting to hear you talk about my responsibility [...] I didn't realize that, and maybe this explains quite a bit, is that the news organizations look to [[Comedy Central]] for their cues on integrity." Jon Stewart further emphasized his distaste for ''Crossfire'' by adding the comment that "To do a debate would be great. But that's like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition." After Carlson told Stewart "I think you're more fun on your show", Stewart replied by saying: "You know what's interesting though? You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show."<ref name="Stewart">{{cite web|url=http://www.joketribe.com/video/Jon.Stewart.On.Crossfire.php |title=Jon Stewart Exposes The Fallacy Of The News Media on CNN's Crossfire |publisher=JokeTribe.com}}</ref>
After asserting that ''The Daily Show'' was a news program, Carlson's remonstration that "You need to get a job at a journalism school, I think" was met with Stewart's comeback, "You need to go to one."

After their televised confrontation, Carlson recalls, Stewart "stayed at CNN several hours after the show to discuss the issues that he raised on the air... He (Stewart) needed to do this".<ref>http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2004-10-24_nytimes_damien_cave.pdf</ref>

In January 2005, CNN announced they were ending their relationship with Carlson and would soon cancel ''Crossfire''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/b/2005/01/07/jon-stewarts-wish-fulfilled-crossfire-to-stop-hurting-america.htm |title=Jon Stewart's Wish Fulfilled; 'Crossfire' to Stop 'Hurting America' |publisher=Politicalhumor.about.com |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/06crossfire.html?_r=1 CNN Will Cancel 'Crossfire' and Cut Ties to Commentator], ''New York Times''.

===MSNBC's ''Tucker''===
{{Main|Tucker (television program)}}

Carlson's early evening show, ''Tucker'', premiered June 13, 2005, on [[MSNBC]] (originally entitled ''The Situation with Tucker Carlson''). The show lasted fewer than three seasons; the network announced its cancellation due to low ratings on March 10, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Gregory Replaces Tucker Carlson on MSNBC Evening Shift |date=March 10, 2008 |publisher=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,336470,00.html}}</ref> The final episode aired on March 14, 2008. Brian Stelter of the New York Times noted that "During Mr. Carlson's tenure, MSNBC's evening programming moved gradually to the left. His former time slots, 6 and 9 p.m., are now occupied by two liberals, Ed Schultz and Rachel Maddow." Carlson himself stated that the network had changed a lot and "they didn't have a role for me."<ref>{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=Tucker Carlson turns 40, moves to Fox News|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/tucker-carlson-turns-40-moves-to-fox-news/|accessdate=2013-03-04|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2009-05-15}}</ref>

Carlson had also hosted a late afternoon weekday wrap-up for MSNBC during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], during which he attempted to learn how to play various Olympic sports. In July 2006, he reported live for ''Tucker'' from [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], during the [[2006 Lebanon War]] between Israel and [[Hezbollah]] in southern Lebanon. While in the [[Middle East]], he also hosted ''MSNBC Special Report: Mideast Crisis.''  He appeared regularly on ''[[Verdict with Dan Abrams]]'' as a panelist in political discussions.

===Fox News Channel===
In May 2009, it was announced that Carlson was hired as a Fox News Contributor. Since then, he has been a frequent guest panelist on Fox's late-night satire show ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]'', made frequent appearances on the All-Star Panel segment of ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', been a substitute host of ''[[Hannity]]'' in Sean Hannity's absence, and produced a Fox News special titled "Fighting for Our Children's Minds."

In March 2013, it was announced that Carlson was tapped to co-host the weekend editions of ''[[Fox & Friends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byers|first=Dylan|title=Tucker Carlson to Fox & Friends Weekends|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/03/tucker-carlson-to-cohost-fox-friends-weekends-160334.html|publisher=Politico.com}}</ref>  Beginning in April, Carlson, a Fox News contributor and frequent guest host on the program, officially joined co-hosts Alisyn Camerota and Clayton Morris on Saturday and Sunday mornings. He replaced [[Dave Briggs (journalist)|Dave Briggs]], who left the news channel to join the [[NBC Sports Network]] on New Years 2013.

===''The Daily Caller''===

{{Main|The Daily Caller}}
On January 11, 2010, Carlson and former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] aide [[Neil Patel (political advisor)|Neil Patel]] launched a political news website titled ''[[The Daily Caller]]''. Carlson serves as editor-in-chief, and occasionally writes opinion pieces with Patel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel Author Page|url=http://dailycaller.com/author/carlsonandpatel/|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Politico]]'', Carlson said that ''The Daily Caller'' will not be tied to ideology but rather will be "breaking stories of importance". In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, Carlson added "We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone." Columnist [[Mickey Kaus]] quit after Carlson refused to run a column critical of [[Fox News]]' coverage of the immigration policy debate.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|title=Mickey Kaus quits Daily Caller after Tucker Carlson pulls critical Fox News column|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/mickey-kaus-quits-daily-caller-after-tucker-carlson-204135.html|work=Politico|date=March 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wemple|first1=Erik|title=Daily Caller‚Äôs Tucker Carlson takes a stand for censorship|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/18/daily-callers-tucker-carlson-takes-a-stand-for-censorship/|work=Washington Post|date=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

==Political views==

===Conservatism===
Carlson's definitions of conservative views often conflict with the mainstream opinion, being called "insufficiently conservative".<ref>''Washingtonian'': [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/the-bearable-lightness-of-being-tucker-carlson/ The Bearable Lightness of Being Tucker Carlson.] November 26, 2012.</ref>  This first began following Carlson's public and private endorsement of 2000 Presidential candidate [[John McCain]]. Speaking to [[Salon.com]], Carlson responded:
<blockquote>I liked McCain. And I would have voted for McCain for president happily, not because I agree with his politics; I never took McCain's politics seriously enough even to have strong feelings about them. I don't think McCain has very strong politics. He's interested in ideas almost as little as George W. Bush is. McCain isn't intellectual, and doesn't have a strong ideology at all. He's wound up sort of as a liberal Republican because he's mad at other Republicans, not because he's a liberal.<ref name="salon 20030913">{{cite web|last=Lauerman |first=Kerry |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/09/13/carlson/index.html |title="You burn out fast when you demagogue" ‚Äì Salon.com |publisher=Dir.salon.com |date=2003-09-13 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref></blockquote>

Carlson has stated that former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] is not a true conservative. In an August 27, 2004, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' interview, Carlson expressed his "displeasure with Bush". Tucker asked: "Why do so many anti-war [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] give Kerry a pass when he adopts the Bush view on Iraq, as he has? The amount of team-playing on the left depresses me."<ref name="A39712-2004Aug27.html">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39712-2004Aug27.html |title=Republican Convention: Tucker Carlson (washingtonpost.com) |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Carlson did not vote in the 2004 election, citing his disgust with the [[Iraq War]] and his disillusionment with the once [[small government]] Republican Party.  He would go on to say:

<blockquote>I don't know what you consider conservative, but I'm not much of a liberal, at least as the word is currently defined. For instance, I'm utterly opposed to abortion, which I think is horrible and cruel. I think affirmative action is wrong. I'd like to slow immigration pretty dramatically. I hate all[nanny state regulations, such as seat belt laws and smoking bans. I'm not for big government. I think the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad. I think these are conservative impulses. So by my criteria, Bush isn't much of a conservative.<ref name="A39712-2004Aug27.html"/></blockquote>

===1999 Bush interview===
Asked by Salon about the response to his article on Bush, Carlson said:

<blockquote>It was very, very hostile. The reaction was: You betrayed us. Well, I was never there as a partisan to begin with. Then I heard that (on the campaign bus, Bush communications director) Karen Hughes accused me of lying. And so I called Karen and asked her why she was saying this, and she had this almost Orwellian rap that she laid on me about how things she'd heard‚Äîthat I watched her hear‚Äîshe in fact had never heard, and she'd never heard Bush use profanity ever. It was insane. I've obviously been lied to a lot by campaign operatives, but the striking thing about the way she lied was she knew I knew she was lying, and she did it anyway. There is no word in English that captures that. It almost crosses over from bravado into mental illness. They get carried away, consultants do, in the heat of the campaign, they're really invested in this. A lot of times they really like the candidate. That's all conventional. But on some level, you think, there's a hint of recognition that there is reality‚Äîeven if they don't recognize reality exists‚Äîthere is an objective truth. With Karen you didn't get that sense at all. A lot of people like her. A lot of people I know like her. I'm not one of them.<ref name="salon 20030913"/></blockquote>

===Supporting, then opposing, the U.S. war in Iraq===
Carlson initially supported the U.S. war with Iraq during its first year. After a year, he began criticizing the war, telling ''[[The New York Observer]]'':

<blockquote>I think it's a total nightmare and disaster, and I'm ashamed that I went against my own instincts in supporting it. It's something I'll never do again. Never. I got convinced by a friend of mine who's smarter than I am, and I shouldn't have done that. No. I want things to work out, but I'm enraged by it, actually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=49632&Disp=14&Trace=on |title=LP: Newly Dovish, Tucker Carlson Goes Public (Tucker Carlson turns against the war) |publisher=Libertypost.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref></blockquote>

===Gay marriage===
On July 24, 2007, Carlson said on his show, "I'm just for marriage generally. I'm for people making a lifelong commitment. Do you know what I mean? I'm not against gay marriage, actually, and I'm the most right-wing person I know."<ref name="msnbc 19976269">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19976269/ |title='Tucker' for July 24 ‚Äì Tucker ‚Äì MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Carlson later went on to say, "I think, marriage has been a great thing for me, and I think it's a really civilizing force, and I think it would be a civilizing force for gay people too."<ref name="msnbc 19976269"/>

===Libertarianism===
[[Image:TuckerRonPaul.jpg|thumb|Tucker Carlson at a 2007 [[Ron Paul]] presidential event.]]
On May 3, 2007, Carlson interviewed Republican presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] and recalled voting for Paul in 1988 when he was running as the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allronpaul.blogspot.com/2007/05/msnbc-tucker-carlson-interviews-ron.html |title=All Ron Paul: Transcript: Tucker Carlson interviews Ron Paul on MSNBC before the May 3 debate |publisher=Allronpaul.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

At the 2009 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], Carlson was booed for saying that the journalists at  ''[[The New York Times]]'' care about accuracy.<ref>Pareene, Alex (2011-01-31) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/01/31/tucker_carlson/index.html Tucker Carlson to receive media "accuracy" award], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref>

On November 26, 2007, it was reported that Carlson lobbied Nevada brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] to support Paul's candidacy.  Explained Carlson, "Dennis Hof is a good friend of mine, so when we got to Nevada, I decided to call him up and see if he wanted to come check this guy out."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIRrv90LfBH2XZpNPhCTNFjQMQGwD8T5E71O0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128131712/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIRrv90LfBH2XZpNPhCTNFjQMQGwD8T5E71O0 |archivedate=November 28, 2007 |title=Paul Endorsed by Nevada Brothel Owner}}</ref>

On September 2, 2008, Carlson participated in Ron Paul's [[Campaign for Liberty]] [[Campaign for Liberty#Rally for the Republic|Rally for the Republic]] in [[Minneapolis]], as the first speaker to introduce the rally and also acted as the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] by introducing nearly every guest speaker.

On February 23, 2009, Carlson was introduced as a senior fellow for the [[Cato Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/02/23/tucker-carlson-joins-the-cato-institute/ |title=Tucker Carlson Joins the Cato Institute &#124; Cato @ Liberty |publisher=Cato-at-liberty.org |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

==Public image==
Carlson was known for wearing [[bow-tie]]s. Sensing that this was part of his costume as a news entertainer, Jon Stewart pointedly raised the issue during the above-described 2004 Crossfire interview. "How old are you?" Stewart asked Carlson. "Thirty-five," he answered. "And you wear a bow-tie," Stewart shot back. "So this is theater," he continued, while a momentarily flustered Carlson exclaimed "I know, I know, you're right." "The thing is," asserted Stewart, "you're doing theater when you should be doing debate."<ref name="Stewart"/>

In 2005 on the season five episode of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', "[[List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes#Season 5 (2005)|The Bowtie]]", a character refers to [[Larry David]] as "Tucker Carlson" for wearing one.
In 2007, he appeared as himself in the episode "Manhattan Project" (Season 9, Episode 10) on the sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''.

On April 11, 2006, Carlson announced on his MSNBC show that he would no longer be wearing a bow-tie, adding, "I just decided I wanted to give my neck a break. A little change is good once in a while, and I feel better already."<ref>{{cite news  |title="The Situation with Tucker Carlson" for April 11 |format=transcript |date=April 11, 2006 |work=[[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12285620/ |quote=Well, if you watched this show before you may have noticed that I look different tonight. I'm not wearing a bow-tie. This is odd for me. I have worn a bow-tie on television every night for the past six years and for 15 years off air before that, since I was in 10th grade. I like bow-ties, and I certainly spent a lot of time defending them. But from now on I'm going without: no ties at all. I didn't lose a bet. It is not a political statement. I didn't ditch the bow-tie in protest or in solidarity with any oppressed group. It's not a ratings ploy but decided. I just decided I wanted to give my neck a break. A little change is good once {{sic|in a|while|expected=in a while}}, and I feel better already. So to all three of you who watch this show for the bow-tie I'm sorry. For the rest of you who don't take a position on neckwear one way or the other we now returned to our regularly scheduled programming.}}</ref> He now wears long [[necktie]]s on the air, and on the February 28, 2014 edition of ''The Alex Jones Show'', while talking about his reasons for returning to wearing a long necktie, Carlson said that "If you wear a bow-tie, it's like [wearing] a middle finger around your neck; you're just inviting scorn and ridicule‚Ä¶the number of people screaming the F-word at me...it wore me down after a while so I gave in and became conventional".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4dSfBxoxbw#t=23m42s The Alex Jones Show]</ref>

His brother Mosby accidentally sent an email meant for Tucker to a spokesperson for [[New York City Mayor]] [[Bill deBlasio]], who had asked for corrections to a story, calling her "whiny little self-righteous bitch" as well as some sexually derogatory things.<ref>http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/buckley-carlson-de-blasio-spokeswoman-bitch</ref> Tucker's reputation was not improved when he gave a smug explanation of the email.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/03/26/tucker-carlsons-brothers-sexist-vulgar-reply-all-wasnt-the-worst-part/</ref>

==''Dancing with the Stars''==
On August 14, 2006, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]] announced that Carlson would be a participant in its fall 2006 ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' [[reality show]].

Carlson reportedly took four-hour-a-day [[ballroom dance]] classes in preparation for the competition, and mourned "missed classes" during an MSNBC assignment in Lebanon.<ref name="AR2006081401091.html">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401091.html |title=Names & Faces |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2006-08-15|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> "It's hard for me to remember the moves," he stated.<ref name="AR2006081401091.html"/> When asked why he accepted ABC's invitation to perform, Carlson responded, "I'm not defending it as the smartest choice, but I think it's the most interesting. I think if you sat back and tried to plan my career, you might not choose this. But my only criterion is the interest level. I want to lead an interesting life." He concluded, "I'm 37. I've got four kids. I have a steady job. I don't do things that I'm not good at very often. I'm psyched to get to do that."<ref name="AR2006081401091.html"/>

The gambling site BetBet placed Carlson's odds of winning the competition at 15:1.<ref>[[n:Mario Lopez favored to win Dancing with the Stars]]</ref> [[Jerry Springer]] was ranked as having the longest odds of winning, at 30:1.

Carlson, who was paired with professional partner [[Elena Grinenko]], was voted off on September 13. His performance on the previous night was the lowest ranked among the judges; the low score resulted from him spending much of the performance sitting down in a chair.

At the close of the show, Carlson said that teaching him to dance was "like Einstein teaching addition to a slow child."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Barrett |first=Annie |title=Tuck Neverlasting |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1534758,00.html |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>
