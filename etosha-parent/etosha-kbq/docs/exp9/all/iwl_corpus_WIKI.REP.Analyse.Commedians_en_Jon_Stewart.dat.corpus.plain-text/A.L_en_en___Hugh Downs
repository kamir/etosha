==Television career==
[[File:Hugh Downs and daughter Deirdre 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Downs and daughter, Deirdre (1960)]]

Downs made his first television news broadcast in September 1945 from the still experimental studio of [[WBBM-TV|WBKB-TV]] (now WBBM-TV), a station then owned by the Balaban and Katz theater subsidiary of [[Paramount Pictures]]. He became a TV regular, announcing for ''[[Hawkins Falls]]'' in 1950, the first successful television [[soap opera]], which was sponsored by [[Lever Brothers]] ''Surf'' detergent. He also announced the [[Burr Tillstrom]] children's show ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' from the [[NBC]] studios at Chicago's [[Merchandise Mart]] after the network picked up the program from WBKB. In March 1954, Downs moved to [[New York]] to accept a position as announcer for [[Pat Weaver]]'s ''[[Home (1954 TV series)|The Home Show]]'' starring [[Arlene Francis]]. That program lasted until August 1957. He was the announcer for [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' for the 1956–57 season, and one of NBC Radio's ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'' "Communicators" from 1955–1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monitorbeacon.net/communicators.html|title=Monitor's Communicators|publisher=MonitorBeacon.net|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> Downs became a ''bona fide'' television "personality" as [[Jack Paar]]'s announcer on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' from mid-1957, when he replaced [[Franklin Pangborn]], until Paar's departure in March 1962,<ref name="Cat"/> and then continued to announce for "The Tonight Show" until the fall of 1962, when [[Ed Herlihy]] took the announcing reins. Herlihy held that post until October 1, 1962, when [[Johnny Carson]] took over the show, and brought [[Ed McMahon]] as his announcer. On August 25, 1958, he concurrently began a more than ten-year run hosting the original version of the game show ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]''.  Also, he hosted [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' for nine years from September 1962 to October 1971, plus he co-hosted the syndicated television program ''Not for Women Only'' with [[Barbara Walters]] in 1975 and 1976. Downs also appeared as a panelist on the television [[game show]] ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and in an episode, cast as himself, on the NBC police sitcom, ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', set in New York City.

Downs earned a postgraduate degree in [[gerontology]] from [[Hunter College]] while he was hosting ''Over&nbsp;Easy'', a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television program about aging that aired from 1977 to 1983.

He was probably best known in later years as the [[Emmy Award]]-winning co-anchor – again paired with Walters – of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] news [[television|TV]] show ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', a primetime news magazine program, from the show's second episode in 1978 until his forced retirement in 1999. His closing tagline "We're in touch, so you be in touch", was written by Brock Brower.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

In 1985, he was certified by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as holding the record for the greatest number of hours on network commercial television (15,188 hours), though he lost the record for most hours on all forms of television to [[Regis Philbin]] in 2004.

A published composer himself, Downs hosted the PBS showcase for [[classical music]], ''[[Live from Lincoln Center]]'' from 1990 to 1996.

Downs made a cameo appearance on ''[[Family Guy]]'' in addition to other TV shows.

Downs has been seen in infomercials for [[Boardroom, Inc.|Bottom Line Publications]], including their ''World's Greatest Treasury of Health Secrets'', as well as another one for a personal coach. He did an infomercial for ''Where There's a Will There's an A'' in 2003. His infomercial work since then has aroused some controversy, with many arguing the products are scams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infomercialwatch.org/reports/treasury.shtml |title=The World’s Greatest Treasury of Health Secrets |quote=Comments on the 2006 Book and Infomercial |first=Timothy J. |last=Quill, MD |publisher=Infomercial Watch}}</ref>

Downs has most recently appeared in regional public service announcements in Arizona, where he currently lives, for that state's Motor Vehicles Division; for Hospice of the Valley, a Phoenix-area non-profit organization specializing in [[Hospice care in the United States|hospice]] care, as well as in many public, short-form programs in which he serves as host of educational interstitials.
