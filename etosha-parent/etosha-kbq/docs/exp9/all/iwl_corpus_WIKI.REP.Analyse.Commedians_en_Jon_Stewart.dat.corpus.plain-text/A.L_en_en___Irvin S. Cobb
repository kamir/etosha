'''Irvin Shrewsbury Cobb''' (June 23, 1876 – March 11, 1944) was an American author, humorist, editor and columnist from [[Paducah, Kentucky]] who relocated to New York during 1904, living there for the remainder of his life. He wrote for the ''[[New York World]],'' [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s newspaper, as the highest paid staff reporter in the United States.

Cobb also wrote more than 60 books and 300 short stories. Some of his works were adapted for silent movies. Several of his Judge Priest short stories were adapted for two feature films during the 1930s directed by [[John Ford]].

==Biography==
Cobb was the second of four children born to Kentucky natives in [[Paducah, Kentucky]].  His maternal grandfather, Reuben Saunders, M.D., is credited with discovering during 1873 that hypodermic use of [[morphine]]-[[atropine]] halted [[cholera]].  Cobb was raised in Paducah, and the events and people of his childhood became the basis for much of his later works.<ref name="fbio">[http://www.fandango.com/irvinscobb/biography/p13807 Ben Eder, "Biography: Irvin S. Cobb"], Rovi, reprinted at Fandango</ref> Later in life, Cobb was nicknamed "Duke of Paducah."<ref name="paducah">[http://paducahky.gov/paducah/history-paducah History of Paducah], City of Paducah, n.d.  Accessed 2013-08-19.</ref>

Cobb was educated in public and private elementary schools, and then entered William A. Cade's Academy intending to pursue a law career. When Cobb was 16, his father became an [[alcoholic]], after the death of his grandfather.  Forced to quit school and find work, Cobb began his writing career.

===Writing career===
Cobb started journalism with the ''Paducah Daily News'' at age seventeen, and became the nation's youngest managing news editor at age nineteen.  He later worked at the ''[[Louisville Evening Post]]'' for a year and a half.

His anecdotal memoir-cum-autobiography, ''Exit Laughing,'' published during 1941, includes a firsthand account of the assassination of Kentucky Governor [[William Goebel]] during 1900 and the trials of the killers. He wrote numerous series in periodicals, and also collaborated on dramatic productions.

After relocating to New York during 1904, Cobb was hired by the ''Evening Sun'' company.  The publication sent him to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] to cover the [[Treaty of Portsmouth|Russian-Japanese peace conference]].  His dispatches from the negotiations, emphasizing the personalities involved (including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]), were published across the country with the title "Making Peace at Portsmouth."  They earned him a job offer from [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''[[New York World]]'' company and he became the highest-paid staff reporter in the United States.<ref name=kylit/>

Cobb joined the staff of the magazine ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' during 1911, and covered the [[World War I|Great War]] for the magazine.  At the same time, he wrote a book about his experiences, published during 1915, titled ''Paths Of Glory''. After a second visit to France to cover the Great War, Cobb publicized the achievements of the unit known as the [[Harlem Hellfighters]], most notably, [[Croix de Guerre]] recipients [[Henry Lincoln Johnson]] and [[Needham Roberts]]. His article "Young Black Joe," published on August 24, 1918 in the ''Saturday Evening Post'' and later republished in Cobb's book, ''The Glory of the Coming,''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cobb|first1=Irvin|title=The Glory of the Coming|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/44225/44225-h/44225-h.htm#link2HCH0017|website=http://www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> highlighted the discipline and courage displayed by black American soldiers fighting in Europe during [[World War I]].  The three-page article and half-page photograph reached a national audience of more than two million readers, and was widely reprinted in the black press.<ref>Nelson, Peter. ''A More Unbending Battle: The Harlem Hellfighters' Struggle for Freedom in WWI and Equality at Home''. New York: Basic Civitas, 2009. ISBN 0-465-00317-6.</ref>

===Hollywood===
Several of Cobb's stories were adapted as silent movies.  He also wrote the screen titles for other movies, including the [[Jackie Coogan]] movie, ''Peck's Bad Boy'' (1921).  With the advent of sound, more of his stories were adapted for the screen, including ''[[The Woman Accused]]'' (1933), featuring young [[Cary Grant]].

[[John Ford]] twice made movies based on Cobb's Judge Priest stories: ''[[Judge Priest]]'' (1934) featured  [[Will Rogers]] in the title role. ''[[The Sun Shines Bright]]'' (1953) was based on his short stories "The Sun Shines Bright", "The Mob from Massac", and "The Lord Provides".

Cobb also had an acting career, acting in 10 movies between 1932 and 1938.  He won major roles in such movies as ''Pepper'', ''Everybody's Old Man'' (1936), and ''[[Hawaii Calls (film)|Hawaii Calls]]'' (1938). He was also host of the [[7th Academy Awards]] during 1935.

During 1919, Cobb was recruited by former U.S. Navy officer and lawyer Capt. W.H. Slayton to become chairman of the Authors and Artists Committee of the Association Against the [[Prohibition]] Amendment (AAPA). The Association based their opposition on the misuse of national government power over U.S. citizens. As chairman, Cobb helped extend coverage of their message through the media and artist networks. This included statements to the press blaming [[Prohibition]] for increased crime, alcoholism, and disrespect for the law. "If [[Prohibition]] is a noble experiment," he said in one, "then the San Francisco fire and the Galveston flood should be listed among the noble experiments of our national history."<ref>"Who the Heck Was Irvin S. Cobb?" by Jack Sullivan, ''Bottles and Extras,'' Summer 2006</ref> At the same time he published ''Red Likker'', an anti-[[Prohibition]] novel. After the repeal of [[Prohibition]], the Frankfort distilleries recruited him to compile a recipe book<ref>''Irvin S. Cobb's Own Recipe Book,'' Frankfort Distilleries, 1934</ref> to remind consumers who were out of practice how to mix a good drink.

The cartoon ''[[The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos]]'' caricatures Cobb as "Irvin S. Frog".

===Personal life===
Cobb has been described as having a round shape, bushy eyebrows, full lips, and a triple chin, with a cigar always hanging from his mouth.<ref name=kylit>{{cite web | author=Kelly Foster | title=Irvin S. Cobb  | url=http://www.english.eku.edu/services/kylit/cobb.htm | work=KYLit| publisher=Eastern Kentucky University | date=30 September 1997 | accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>

He married the former Laura Spencer Baker of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Their daughter, [[Elizabeth Cobb]]<ref name=nyt /> (born 1902), was also an author.  She published the novel ''She Was a Lady'' and the nonfiction ''My Wayward Parent'' (1945), a book about her father.  Her first husband was Frank Michler Chapman, Jr., son of the ornithologist [[Frank Michler Chapman]].

Cobb's granddaughter was [[Buff Cobb]], a television actor of the early 1950s. She married journalist [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] as his second wife.<ref name=nyt>Hevesi, Dennis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/arts/television/22cobb.html "Buff Cobb, Actress and TV Host, Dies at 82"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 21, 2010</ref>

Cobb was honored during 1915 with the march "The War Correspondent" by G.E. Holmes, published by the John Church Company.[[File:Irvin S. Cobb by Tony Sarg 1916.jpg|thumb|Irvin S. Cobb wearing a [[coonskin cap]] and smoking a cigar.<br />Illustration by [[Tony Sarg]] for "The Glory of the States: Kentucky" by Irvin S. Cobb, published in ''[[The American Magazine]]'' for May 1916.]]

{{cns|text=When Cobb died in [[New York City]] during 1944, his body was sent to Paducah for cremation.  His ashes were placed under a dogwood tree.  The granite boulder marking his remains is inscribed "Irvin Shrewsbury Cobb 1876-1944 Back Home".

Cobb wrote a letter detailing his desired funeral arrangements. The document reads in part:
<blockquote>
Above all I want no long faces and no show of grief at the burying ground. Kindly observe the final wishes of the undersigned and avoid reading the so-called Christian burial service which, in view of the language employed in it, I regard as one of the most cruel and paganish things inherited by our forebears from our remote pagan ancestors. In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the [[Psalm 23|Twenty-third Psalm]], which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and is mine since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by the people who are surest of going there, must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|date=August 2014}}
</blockquote>

==Fiction==
Cobb is remembered best for his humorous stories of Kentucky and is part of the [[American literary regionalism]] school. These stories were collected first in the book ''Old Judge Priest'' (1915), whose title character was based on a prominent West Kentucky judge named William Pitman Bishop. Writer [[Joel Harris]] wrote of these tales, "Cobb created a South peopled with honorable citizens, charming eccentrics, and loyal, subservient blacks, but at their best the Judge Priest stories are dramatic and compelling, using a wealth of precisely rendered detail to evoke a powerful mood."<ref name=kylit/> Among his other books are the humorous ''Speaking of Operations'' (1916), and anti-prohibition ode to bourbon, ''Red Likker'' (1929).

Cobb also wrote short stories with a horror style, such as "Fishhead" (1911) and "The Unbroken Chain" (1923). "Fishhead" has been cited as an inspiration for [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]'', while "The Unbroken Chain" was a model for Lovecraft's "[[The Rats in the Walls]]".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Annotated Supernatural Horror in Literature |publisher=Hippocampus Press |location=[[New York, New York]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-9673215-0-6 |pages=99}}</ref> The former was described by Lovecraft as "banefully effective in its portrayal of unnatural affinities between a hybrid idiot and the strange fish of an isolated lake" in his essay ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]''.<ref>[[s:Supernatural Horror in Literature/The Weird Tradition in America|The Weird Tradition in America]], ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]''</ref>
