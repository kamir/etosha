===Amboy Dukes===
His first edition of [[The Amboy Dukes]] played at [[The Cellar (teen dance club)|The Cellar]], a teen dance club outside of Chicago in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]], starting in late 1965, while Nugent was a student at [[St. Viator High School]]. The Cellar's "house band" at the time had been the [[Shadows of Knight]], although the Amboy Dukes eventually became a staple until the club's closing.<ref>[http://www.tednugent.com/hunting/news/2008/default.aspx?PostID=539794 "Ted, White, and Blue: Nugent Recalls Some Career Milestones."] Retrieved 2008-11-30.</ref>

The Amboy Dukes' second single was "Journey to the Center of the Mind", which featured lyrics written by the Dukes' second guitarist [[Steve Farmer (musician)|Steve Farmer]]. Nugent, an ardent anti-drug campaigner, has always claimed that he had no idea that this song was about [[recreational drug use|drug use]].<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/11/us-nugent-idUSTRE53A00C20090411 |last=Graff |first=Gary |title=Ted Nugent reuniting Amboy Dukes for Detroit event |agency=Reuters |date=April 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}</ref> ''The Amboy Dukes'' (1967), ''Journey to the Center of the Mind'' (1968) and ''Migrations ft. [[Rusty Day]]'' (1969) — all recorded on the Mainstream label — sold moderately well. On April 5, 1968, Nugent along with a group of musicians paid tribute to [[Martin Luther King]] by having a folk, rock and blues jam session. [[Joni Mitchell]] played first, followed by [[Buddy Guy]], [[Cactus (band)|Cactus]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Other musicians who participated were [[BB King]] and [[Al Kooper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/chronology/byyear.cfm?year=1968|title=Joni Mitchell's Chronology of Appearances, 1968|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|date=|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>

After settling down on a ranch in Michigan in 1973, Nugent signed a record deal with [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[DiscReet Records]] label and recorded ''[[Call of the Wild (Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes album)|Call of the Wild]]''. The following year, ''[[Tooth Fang & Claw]]'' (which contained the song "Great White Buffalo", arranged with [[Rob Grange]]) established a fan base for Nugent and the other Amboy Dukes. Personnel changes nearly wrecked the band, which became known as Ted Nugent & the Amboy Dukes. Nugent reunited with the other members of the Amboy Dukes at the 2009 Detroit Music Awards, which took place April 17, 2009. The psychedelic band received a distinguished achievement honor at the event. The Dukes also played together at the ceremony, marking their first public performance in more than 30 years.<ref name="Ref-1"/>

===Solo career===
{{See also|Ted Nugent discography}}
Nugent dropped the Amboy Dukes band name for good in 1975, and signed to [[Epic Records]]. [[Derek St. Holmes]] (guitar, vocals), [[Rob Grange]] (bass) and [[Clifford Davies]] (drums) were the primary additional band members for his 1970s multi-platinum<ref name="TedNugentASearch">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Ted%20Nugent&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by Ted Nugent|publisher=Riaa.com|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> albums: ''[[Ted Nugent (album)|Ted Nugent]]'' (1975), ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' (1976) and ''[[Cat Scratch Fever]]'' (1977). These albums produced the popular radio anthems "Hey Baby", "[[Stranglehold (Ted Nugent song)|Stranglehold]]", "Dog Eat Dog", and "[[Cat Scratch Fever (song)|Cat Scratch Fever]]". It was during these three years that Nugent emerged as a guitar hero to hard rock fans, many of whom were unaware of his lengthy apprenticeship with the Amboy Dukes.<ref>Charlesworth, Chris. ''A-Z of Rock Guitarists'', pg. 65</ref> This band lineup toured extensively, also releasing the multi-platinum live album ''[[Double Live Gonzo!]]'', until its breakup in 1978 when St. Holmes and Grange departed. St. Holmes was replaced by Charlie Huhn and Grange by Dave Kiswiney. Davies left around 1982 after staying on to record ''[[Weekend Warriors (album)|Weekend Warriors]]'' (1978), ''[[State of Shock (Ted Nugent album)|State of Shock]]'' (1979), ''[[Scream Dream]]'' (1980) and ''[[Intensities in 10 Cities]]'' (1981).

On July 8, 1979, Ted was on the rock radio program ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]''. This was the original broadcast of Ted's performance of ''[[Live at Hammersmith '79]]'' which had been recorded during the second set of a night at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1979. An album of this program was released in 1997.

During this era, Nugent was notable for his declarations that he did not drink alcoholic beverages or smoke [[tobacco]] or [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. In an interview for [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind The Music]]'', Nugent said this was due to his father's having reprimanded him when he came home smelling of alcohol after a night of drinking. Nugent has been cited as an influence on the [[straight edge]] movement, which disavows drinking and recreational drug use.<ref>[[Henry Rollins]] reports that he and friend [[Ian MacKaye]] (vocalist for [[Minor Threat]], who recorded the song "Straight Edge" that gave the cultural movement its name) "would read about the Nuge and the thing that really rubbed off on us was the fact that he didn't drink or smoke or do drugs ... [Nugent's performance] was the craziest thing we'd ever seen onstage and here's this guy saying, 'I don't get high.' We thought that was so impressive."

===Influences===
Nugent has cited his own musical influences as [[Vanilla Fudge]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[The Ventures]], [[Wayne Cochran]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Yardbirds]], [[Duane Eddy]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lonnie Mack]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Mitch Ryder|Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels]], [[The Animals]], [[Little Richard]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[Muddy Waters]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Damn Yankees===
[[File:Nuge2.JPG|right|thumb|Ted Nugent live in 2007]]
During the period of 1982–89, Nugent released a series of moderately successful solo albums. In 1989, he joined the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]], with [[Jack Blades]] (bass/vocals, of [[Night Ranger]]), [[Tommy Shaw]] (guitar/vocals, of [[Styx (band)|Styx]]) and [[Michael Cartellone]] (drums). ''[[Damn Yankees (album)|Damn Yankees]]'' (1990) was a hit, going multi-platinum in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the smash hit power ballad "[[High Enough]]". The video for this song featured Nugent in a priest's collar, and later in a zebra-striped cape during the guitar solo. It also saw the first appearance of his 'WhackMaster' hat.

===Back to solo===
Returning to a solo career, Nugent released ''[[Spirit of the Wild]]'' in 1995, his best-reviewed album in quite some time. The album also marked the return of Derek St. Holmes to Nugent's studio band. A series of archival releases also came out in the 1990s, keeping Nugent's name in the national consciousness. He also began hosting a radio show in Detroit on [[WPZR|WWBR-FM]] ("102.7 The Bear, Detroit's Rock Animal") and took ownership in several hunting-related businesses. He created TV shows for several networks; ''[[Wanted: Ted or Alive]]'' on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]], ''Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild'' on PBS and The Outdoor Channel, as well as ''Surviving Nugent'' and ''[[Supergroup (TV series)|Supergroup-Damnocracy]]'' on VH1.

Ted Nugent appears on [[David Crowder Band]]'s 2007 release, ''[[Remedy (David Crowder Band album)|Remedy]]'', playing guitar on the song "We Won't Be Quiet".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearitfirst.com/newsTour/default.aspx?news_id=540077|title=David Crowder talks about "Remedy"|publisher=Hear It First|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref> He announced his "Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead" tour on April 21, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tednugent.com/news/music/newsDetails.aspx?PostID=940937|title=Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead Tour 2010|publisher=TedNugent.com|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

On March 14, 2011, Nugent released a new song, "I Still Believe", as a free download via his website to subscribers to his news letter. Nugent says of the song: "America is a target-rich environment for an independent man addicted to logic, truth and The American Way. 'I Still Believe' throttles the animal spirit of rugged individualism in pure MotorCity ultra high-energy rhythm and blues and rock and roll."<ref name="Blabber">{{cite web|work= Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=155281|title=Ted Nugent: New Song Available For Free Download, March 14, 2011|accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref><ref name="TedNugentwebsite">{{cite web|work=TedNugent.com|url=http://www.tednugent.com/mailinglist|title=SIGN UP & GET A FREE MP3 OF I STILL BELIEVE|accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref> In April 2011 Nugent announced that former frontman Derek St. Holmes would be joining his band for Nugent's I Still Believe Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/News/Derek-St-Holmes-0404-2011/|title=Gibson Lifestyle, 2011|publisher=Gibson.com|date=2008-06-24|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>

==Media appearances==

===Reality programming===
Nugent starred in his own outdoors television show, named after his popular song "[[Spirit of the Wild]]." The song was the theme music to the TV series, in which Nugent took viewers on a variety of wild game hunts using his bow. In the series, he taught and advised hunters and "hands-on" conservationists around the world on the different aspects of hunting and politics, and informed the public on the importance of getting children away from the TV and video games and getting them out beyond the pavement in order to better their lives.<ref>[http://www.outdoorchannel.com/Shows/TedNugent.aspx Spirit of the Wild]. Outdoor Channel.</ref>

In 2003, he was host of the [[VH1]] [[reality television]] program ''[[Surviving Nugent]],'' in which city dwellers such as model [[Tila Tequila]] moved to Nugent's Michigan ranch in order to survive such "backwoods" activities as building an [[outhouse]] and [[skinning]] a [[boar]]. The success of the two-hour show spawned a four-part miniseries in 2004, titled ''Surviving Nugent: The Ted Commandments.'' This time it was filmed on Nugent's ranch in [[China Spring, Texas]]. During filming, Nugent injured himself with a [[chainsaw]], requiring 44 stitches and a leg brace.

In 2003, Nugent also guested on the VH1 program ''[[Forever Wild]],'' hosted by [[Sebastian Bach]], former lead vocalist for the band [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]]. They shot some firearms and walked around Nugent's cabin in the woods. Two years later, in 2005, Nugent hosted a reality-type show, ''Wanted: Ted or Alive,'' on what was then called the OLN, or Outdoor Life Network, before it became the [[NBC Sports Network]] of the present day. In ''Wanted: Ted or Alive,'' contestants competed for money as well as for opportunities to go hunting with "Uncle Ted." The contestants had to kill and clean their own food to survive.

In 2006, he appeared on VH1's [[reality television|reality show]] ''[[Supergroup (TV series)|SuperGroup]],'' with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] guitarist [[Scott Ian]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] bassist [[Evan Seinfeld]], ex-[[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] lead singer [[Sebastian Bach]], and [[John Bonham]]'s son [[Jason Bonham]], who had been the drummer for [[Bonham (band)|Bonham]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]. The name of the supergroup was originally FIST but later was changed to [[Damnocracy]]. Bach had lobbied for the name Savage Animal. Captured on film by VH1 was a rare Nugent duet with guitarist [[Joe Bonamassa]] at the [[Sand Dollar Blues Room]] for a 45-minute blues jam. He starred in another reality show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in August 2009. The show, titled ''Runnin' Wild ... From Ted Nugent,'' featured Nugent instructing competitors in the art of survival; the competitors had to use those skills in challenges in which Nugent himself hunted them down.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1608368/runnin-wild-from-ted-nugent-competition-series-coming-to-cmt.jhtml Runnin Wild From Ted Nugent Series Coming to CMT] CMT.com, April 2, 2009</ref>

In 2008, Nugent was a guest on the episode ''Southwest Road Trip Special'' of ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]],'' where he spoke against [[obesity]] and [[public health care]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/tony-chews-the-fat-with-ted-nugent-11738|title=Tony chews the fat with Ted Nugent|work=Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|publisher=The Travel Channel L.L.C.|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tednugent.com/news/newsDetails.aspx?PostID=593371#topNav|title=TV: ANTHONY BOURDAIN'S NO RESERVATIONS / TRAVEL CHANNEL|date=August 4, 2008|work=|publisher=tednugent.com|accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>

Also in 2009, Nugent played guitar at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] for a [[Tax Day Tea Party]] hosted by [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]. Most notable in his set was a version of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" in which he used [[alternate picking]] and [[whammy bar]] effects. The clip and sound bite of this came to be played extensively on Fox News as well as on ''[[The Glenn Beck Program]].''

===Acting===
In 1976 Nugent was in the documentary ''Demon Lover Diary'', about the making of the [[John Dods]]' horror/comedy movie ''[[My Demon Lover]]''. He is shown supplying real guns for the making of ''My Demon Lover'', as the crew films at Nugent's house.

In 1986, he guest starred in an episode of the hit television show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' entitled "Definitely Miami". Nugent played a villain. His song "Angry Young Man" was featured in the episode. His song "Little Miss Dangerous" was also featured on a ''Miami Vice'' episode of the same name, although he did not appear in the episode.

In 2001, Nugent appeared as himself in a third season episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' entitled "Backstage Pass". Donna Pinciotti ([[Laura Prepon]]), who works for radio station WFPP, obtains tickets to the upcoming Ted Nugent concert for the entire gang. Following the concert, her boss Max ([[Howard Hesseman]]) gives Donna a backstage pass to meet Nugent, where he volunteers to sit for an interview. Meanwhile, Steven Hyde ([[Danny Masterson]]) and Fez ([[Wilmer Valderrama]]) try to sell unauthorized concert [[t-shirts]] accidentally spelled ''Tad Nugent''.

Also in 2001, Nugent appeared as himself in the second episode of the short-lived university campus [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] comedy series, ''[[Undeclared]]''. In the episode "Full Bluntal Nugety", Nugent is a guest at the university, there to speak on his favorite topics, mainly hunting and gun control. This is where new student Steven Karp ([[Jay Baruchel]]) takes his love interest Lizzie ([[Carla Gallo]]) on their first date. Karp tries to heckle Nugent during his speech in an attempt to impress Lizzie, with disastrous results. FOX didn't like the idea of Nugent and his political views appearing on this show, so the episode was re-shot and re-edited as "Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend?" which aired without any Ted Nugent content whatsoever. The complete "Full Bluntal Nugety (Director's Cut)" episode is available in its entirety, in the ''[[Undeclared]]'' DVD box set, including some extra Ted Nugent scenes that had been deleted.

He made a guest appearance on the [[cult television]] series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', in the episode "[[Gee Whiz (Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode)|Gee Whiz]]", on [[Adult Swim]]. Locals believe to have seen the face of [[Jesus]] in a billboard, and they mention how it looks like Ted Nugent. Throughout the episode they think it's Jesus' face, but at the end they discover it was in fact Nugent's. He proceeds to shoot a flaming explosive arrow at Carl (mistaking him for a "varmint"). Ted also appeared on [[Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy]] when he kills the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] and serves him to guests for dinner.

In 2007, Nugent appeared in the music video for [[Nickelback]]'s "Rockstar", and in 2008 he played a key role in the [[Toby Keith]] movie ''[[Beer For My Horses (film)|Beer For My Horses]]'' as the quiet deputy named Skunk.

In 2007, Nugent debated ''[[The Simpsons]]'' producer [[Sam Simon]] on the ''[[Howard Stern Show]]'' about the ethics of hunting animals. Coincidentally, Nugent would later lend his voice to an over-the-phone appearance in the [[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]] episode of ''The Simpsons'', "[[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]", where, in a humorous jab at his political stance, inmate Dwight picks up his call for voting no to the fictional Proposition 87, which bans crossbows in public schools. As part of his pre-recorded message, Nugent asks "If we outlaw crossbows in our public schools, who's going to protect our children from charging elk?".<ref>{{Cite episode|title=I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|episodelink=|url=http://www.watchcartoononline.com/the-simpsons-season-19-episode-4-i-don%E2%80%99t-wanna-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings|accessdate=2011-05-24|series=[[The Simpsons]]|season=[[The Simpsons (season 19)|19]]|time=12:30|quote=If we outlaw crossbows in our public schools, who's going to protect our children from charging elk?}}</ref>

In 2012, Nugent again appeared as himself on ''The Simpsons'', on the January 8th Episode "[[Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson]]," where he is nominated as a Presidential candidate for the Republican Party.

In the late 1990s, Nugent began writing for various magazines.

===Family===
Nugent has been married twice and has eight children. In the late 1960s, prior to his first marriage, Nugent fathered a boy, Ted (Mann) and a girl, whom he gave up for adoption in infancy. This did not become public knowledge until 2010. The siblings were adopted separately and had no contact with one another. The son learned the identity of his birth father in 2010 through the daughter's quest to make contact with him and their birth parents. According to a news report, Nugent over the years had discussed the existence of these children with his other children.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/11/2011-03-11_chip_off_the_old_madman_block__brooklyn_restaurateur_finds_out_hes_the_son_of_te.html ''New York Daily News'' report on Nugent's children], March 11, 2011</ref>

In 1978, Nugent began a relationship with seventeen-year-old [[Hawaii]] native Pele Massa. Due to the age difference they could not marry so Nugent joined Massa's parents in signing documents to make himself her [[legal guardian]], an arrangement that ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine ranked in October 2000 as #63 on their list of the "100 Sleaziest Moments in Rock".<ref name=Spin2000>{{Cite journal|last=Spitz|first=Marc|date=October 2000|work=Spin: The 100 Sleaziest Moments in Rock|title=Wang Dang Technically Legal Poontang: Whether Hunting or Romancing, the Nuge Likes Fresh Meat|volume=16|issue=10|page=134|issn=0886-3032|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HTMuhxamaFEC&pg=PA134|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name="IMDB">{{Cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637823/bio| title=IMDB: Biography|publisher=IMDb|year=2006|accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref>

===Concealed Carry Weapon (CCW) law===
Nugent is a strong advocate of the [[right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]]. When interviewed by ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' editor [[Evan Smith]] in season 5 of TexasMonthlyTalks he said, "I would rather that [a victim of violent crime] in Massachusetts last month who was taking her daughter to soccer when they were carjacked by a recidivist maggot, who had been in the prison system all his life but was let out again because we feel sorry for him, maybe he had a bad childhood. Instead of her being hijacked and murdered, I'd rather she just shot the bastard dead... But in Massachusetts, somebody decided she can't do that. So she's dead. I would rather she was alive and the carjacker was dead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/texasmonthlytalks|title=Texas Monthly Talks|publisher=Texasmonthly.com|accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

===Conflicts with animal rights groups===
Nugent, who is known for his pessimistic views against [[animal rights]],  said in a long interview, "I'm stymied to come up with anything funnier than people who think animals have rights. Just stick an arrow through their lungs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalflushmagazine.com/2009/12/29/inside-the-mind-of-ted-nugent |title=INSIDE THE MIND OF TED NUGENT – RF6 Exclusive « Royal Flush Magazine |publisher=Royalflushmagazine.com |date=2009-12-29 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> In 2000, Bhaskar Sinha was jailed briefly following an incident outside a department store in [[San Francisco]] in which he threatened and physically assaulted Nugent, who in turn took Sinha into custody until San Francisco Police arrived and arrested the protester.

Nugent has reported receiving death threats against him and his family from animal rights activists. On the ''[[Bullshit!|Penn & Teller's Bullshit!]]'' episode about [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), Nugent claimed, "We've got reports and files with law enforcement across America where the animal rights extremists are on record threatening to kill my children on the way to school because we eat pheasant." In 2006 he stated in an interview that "anyone who thinks hunting is terrible can kiss my ass."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56303|title=Ted Nugent: People Who Think Hunting Is Terrible Can Kiss My A**|publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>

In a 1992 radio interview, Nugent referred to Heidi Prescott of the Fund for Animals as a "worthless whore" and a "shallow slut," asking "who needs to club a seal, when you can club Heidi?" He was ordered by a court to pay Prescott $75,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.campusprogress.org/tools/253|title=Know Your Right-Wing Speakers|publisher=Campusprogress.org|date=2005-04-25|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>

Nugent has said, "I understand the criticism from those who say canned hunting violates the ethic of fair chase," though he still operates the facility, and refers to it as "high fence hunting". Nugent was interviewed in October 2011 by ''[[Field & Stream]]'' magazine regarding "canned" hunts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tednugent.com/hunting/news/2007/default.aspx?PostID=179134|title=The Official Community of Ted Nugent|publisher=Tednugent.com|date=|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>

The band [[Goldfinger]], known for their animal rights advocacy, wrote a song called "FTN", which is harshly critical of Nugent and his hunting tactics.

===Illegal hunting charges===
In September 2009, Nugent embarked on a hunt near [[Somerset, El Dorado County, California]]. He was accompanied by a guide and a cameraman, filming for his [[Outdoor Channel]] show "Spirit of the Wild." The video taken appeared in an episode of the show first broadcast on February 9, 2010. [[California Department of Fish and Game|California Fish and Game]] [[game warden|wardens]] who watched the broadcast noticed that it showed Nugent killing a very young [[deer|buck]] which had been attracted by commercial bait. Both the killing of such a young deer and the use of bait are crimes under California state law. On August 13, 2010, he pled [[no contest]] in [[Yuba County, California|Yuba County]] to two misdemeanors: illegally baiting a deer, and failing to have a deer tag signed by a government official after a kill. He was fined [[USD]] $1,750 by the court and was banned from hunting in California until June 2012.

In April 2012 Nugent signed a plea bargaining agreement to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for illegally taking a bear after shooting one earlier at a bait station. He was fined $10,000, banned from hunting in Alaska and on Federal land for one year, and must complete two years on federal probation.<ref name="convictions">{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/04/20/4430923/ted-nugent-signs-plea-agreement.html|title=Ted Nugent signs plea agreement in black bear shooting case.|publisher=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=2012-04-20|first=Casey|last=Grove|accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref>

Although Nugent has never run for government office, in the 2000s, he publicly speculated about doing so on several occasions. In May 2005, he announced he was "getting real close to deciding to run" for governor of Michigan in 2006, while in 2007, he talked about running for that office in 2010. During the latter period, he stated, "Michigan was once a great state. Michigan was a state that rewarded the entrepreneur and the most productive, work-ethic families of the state. Now the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats are basically the state's babies."<ref name="Tanner, Adam 2007"/> Earlier, Nugent had been rumored to be under consideration by the [[Illinois Republican Party]] as its candidate in that state's 2004 Senate race, given his roots in [[Palatine, Illinois|Palatine]], [[Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrun.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=24838|title=Ted Nugent To Run For U.S. Senate?|publisher=Roadrun.com|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>

In May 2007 Nugent criticized [[rap metal]] band [[Rage Against the Machine]] after singer [[Zach de la Rocha]]'s onstage proclamation at the 2007 Coachella festival that the "current administration . . . should be hung and tried and shot." Nugent appeared on the [[Hannity & Colmes]] program on Fox News and said "We've disagreed with a lot of administrations in the past, but none of our rhetoric included threatening lives, these guys are over the top, but they're the lunatic fringe that even your average Democrat and liberal doesn't agree with.

On July 17, 2008, during the presidential election season and shortly before the Republican presidential nominating convention, Nugent expressed his skepticism about presumptive GOP Presidential nominee [[John McCain]] stating that McCain was "catering to a growing segment of soulless Americans who care less what they can do for their country, but whine louder and louder about what their country must do for them. That is both un-American and pathetic."<ref>[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080717/ENT04/807170344/1111 ''Des Moines Register'' text of interview with Nugent]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> He was a weekly contributor to the newspaper, the ''[[Waco Tribune-Herald]]'' until 2009.<ref>[http://www.wacotrib.com/opin/content/news/opinion/stories/nugent/06172007_wac_nugent.html Ted Nugent: 'Live and let live' foreign idea to left] {{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> He has been a special deputy sheriff in [[Lake County, Michigan]] since 1982 and he also has been a reserve deputy constable in [[McLennan County, Texas]].

In a January 2014 interview at a [[Las Vegas]] hunting and outdoor trade show, recorded by Guns.com, Nugent was recorded stating, "I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame enough Americans to be ever vigilant not to let a [[Chicago]] communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America".<ref>{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Morgan|title=Ted Nugent calls Obama 'subhuman mongrel'|url=http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/ted-nugent-calls-obama-subhuman-mongrel?cid=sm_facebook|date=January 22, 2014}}</ref> After being chastised by [[Rand Paul]], Nugent apologized for his "subhuman mongrel" statement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/198916-nugent-apologizes-for-calling-obama-a-subhuman-mongrel |title=Nugent apologizes for calling Obama 'subhuman mongrel' |last1=Shabad |first1=Rebecca |date=21 February 2014 |website=thehill.com |publisher=News Communications, Inc. |accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>
