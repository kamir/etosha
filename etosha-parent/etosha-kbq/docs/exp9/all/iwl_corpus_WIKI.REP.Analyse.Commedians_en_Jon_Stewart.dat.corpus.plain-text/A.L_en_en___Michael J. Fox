Fox, at age 15, starred in the Canadian television series ''[[Leo and Me]]'' produced by the CBC, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided to move back to Vancouver.<ref name="actors"/> Fox is one of four members of the ''Leo and Me'' cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.<ref name="Atkins">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/apr/04/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing|title=Can you catch Parkinson's?|last=Atkins|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Rocca">{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/64051_mjfox27ww.shtml|title=Michael J.

Fox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film ''Letters from Frank'', credited under the name "Michael Fox". He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the [[Screen Actors Guild]], which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities, he discovered that [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]], a veteran [[character actor]], was already registered under the name.<ref name="actors"/> As he explained in his autobiography, ''Lucky Man: A Memoir'' and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name.

Fox's first feature film roles were ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' (1980) and ''[[Class of 1984]]'' (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing "Young Republican" [[Alex P. Keaton]] in the show ''[[Family Ties]]'' which aired on [[NBC]] for seven seasons, 1982-89. In an interview with [[Jimmy Fallon]] in April 2014, Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at [[Pioneer Chicken]]. He received the role only after [[Matthew Broderick]] was unavailable.<ref name=slate/> ''Family Ties'' had been sold to the television network using the pitch "[[Hip (slang)|Hip]] parents, [[Square (slang)|square]] kids,"<ref name=slate>{{cite web|last=Haglund |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2007/03/reagans_favorite_sitcom.single.html |title=Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref> with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode.<ref name=slate/> At its peak, the audience for ''Family Ties'' drew one-third of America's households every week.<ref name="actors" /> Fox won three [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards for ''Family Ties'', in 1986, 1987 and 1988.<ref name="Emmy" /> He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1989.<ref name=globes />

[[Brandon Tartikoff]], one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that "this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription "To Brandon, this is for you to put your [[eating crow|crow in]]. Love and Kisses, Michael J.

In 1980, Fox auditioned for the role of Conrad Jarrett in the Academy Award winning film ''[[Ordinary People]]''.

===Film career===
[[File:Michael J Fox 1988-cropped1.jpg|thumb|150px|Michael J. Fox at the 40th Emmy Awards, August 1988.]]
In January 1985 Fox was cast to replace [[Eric Stoltz]] as [[Marty McFly]], a teenager who is accidentally sent [[Time travel|back in time]] from 1985 to 1955 in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.
[[Robert Zemeckis]], the director, originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but [[Gary David Goldberg]] the creator of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as [[Meredith Baxter]] was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character [[Alex Keaton]] was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming ''Back to the Future'', but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved.<ref name="Making">"Back to the Future: Making the Trilogy: Chapter 1 (DVD Documentary)"</ref> Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in ''[[Once Bitten (1985 film)|Once Bitten]]'', but it eventually went to [[Jim Carrey]]. During filming, Fox would rehearse for ''Family Ties'' from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the ''Back to the Future'' set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30&nbsp;a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. ''Back to the Future'' was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=backtothefuture.htm |title=Back to the Future Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star [[Christopher Lloyd]] imbued Marty and [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]]'s friendship with a quality reminiscent of [[King Arthur]] and [[Merlin]].<ref>{{cite news | work = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788826 | date = July 1, 1985 | title = Back to the Future | accessdate = October 9, 2008}}</ref> The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990).

[[File:Michael J. Fox with Rick Best.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Fox at the 39th Emmy Awards in September 1987.]]
During and immediately after the ''[[Back to the Future trilogy]]'', Fox starred in ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' (1985), '' [[Light of Day]]'' (1987), ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' (1987), ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1988) and ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989).

In ''The Secret of My Success'', Fox played a recent graduate from [[Kansas State University]] who moves to New York City where he has to deal with the downs and ups of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, taking $110 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=secretofmysuccess.htm |title=The Secret of My Success Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] in ''The Chicago Sun Times'' wrote; "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301 |title=The Secret of My Success Review |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=April 10, 1987 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

In ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'', Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticizing Fox by claiming that "he was the wrong actor for the job".<ref name="hinson">{{cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | title = ''City'' Blight | work = Washington Post | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = | accessdate =}}</ref> Meanwhile Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)".<ref name="ebert">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = ''Bright Lights, Big City'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880401/REVIEWS/804010301/1023 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}</ref> During the shooting of ''Bright Lights, Big City'', Michael was reunited with his on-screen girlfriend [[Tracy Pollan]] from ''[[Family Ties]]''.

Fox then starred in ''Casualties of War'', a war drama about the [[Vietnam War]], alongside [[Sean Penn]]. ''[[Casualties of War]]'' was not a box office hit, but Fox, playing a private serving in [[Vietnam]], received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic’s website wrote; "Fox, only one year beyond his ''[[Family Ties]]'' sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |title=Casualties of War Review |publisher=Film Critic Website |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

In 1991, he starred in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. [[Michael Caton-Jones]], from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', described Fox in the film as "at his frenetic best".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |title=Doc Hollywood Review |work=Time Out |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref> ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'' was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer [[James Woods]]. Between 1992 and 1996, he continued making several films, such as ''[[For Love or Money (1993 film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1993), ''[[Life With Mikey]]'' (1993) and ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'' (1994). Fox then played small supporting roles in political drama ''[[The American President]]'' (1995) and comedy ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996).<ref name="actors"/>

His last major film role was in ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''[[The Frighteners]]'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his "ghost hunting" business. However, a [[mass murder]]er comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, [[Kenneth Turan]] in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote; "The film's actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and [Trini] [[Trini Alvarado|Alvarado]], who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3,0,6464899.story |title=The Frighteners Review |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 19, 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091031053608/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3,0,6464899.story |archivedate=2009-10-31 |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

===Illness and activism===
Fox started displaying symptoms of early-onset [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1991 while shooting the movie ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', although he was not properly diagnosed until the next year.<ref name="QuitsSpinCity" /> After his diagnosis, Fox began drinking more heavily than in the past; however, he sought help and stopped drinking altogether.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/11/michael-j-fox-parkinsons |title=It's the gift that keeps on taking |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 | location=London | first=Emma | last=Brockes}}</ref> In 1998, he decided to go public with his condition, and since then he has been a strong advocate of Parkinson's disease research.<ref name="actors"/> His foundation, [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation]], was created to help advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson's disease, including [[embryonic stem cell]] studies.<ref name="actors"/>

Fox manages the symptoms of his Parkinson's disease with the drug [[carbidopa/levodopa]],<ref name="NPR Fresh Air">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1142526 "Fresh Air" interview by Terry Gross"] National Public Radio, April 2002.</ref> and he also had a [[thalamotomy]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/06/parkinsons.deep.brain.stimulation/index.html |title=Brain implant better than meds for Parkinson's disease |publisher=CNN |date=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>

His first book, ''Lucky Man'', focused on how, after seven years of denial of the disease, he set up the Michael J Fox Foundation, stopped drinking and began to be an advocate for Parkinson's disease sufferers.<ref name="MJF_guardian">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/11/michael-j-fox-parkinsons | title='It's the gift that keeps on taking'| date=April 11, 2009| author=Emma Brockes |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}</ref>

In ''Lucky Man'', Fox wrote that he did not take his medication prior to his testimony before the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Subcommittee]] in 1999 ([http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/4271310 full C-Span video clip]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9909/28/fox.parkinsons/|title=CNN - Michael J.

{{Quote box
 |quote = I had made a deliberate choice to appear before the subcommittee without medication. It seemed to me that this occasion demanded that my testimony about the effects of the disease, and the urgency we as a community were feeling, be seen as well as heard.

In an interview with [[NPR]] in April 2002,<ref name="NPR Fresh Air"/> Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic during an interview; {{Quote box
 |quote = Well, actually, I've been erring on the side of caution—I think "erring" is actually the right word—in that I've been medicating perhaps too much, in the sense [that] ... the symptoms ... people see in some of these interviews that [I] have been on are actually [[dyskinesia]], which is a reaction to the medication. Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do... I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough Sinemet in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, "You take too much medication." I say, Well, you sit across from [[Larry King]] and see if you want to tempt it.

In 2006, Fox starred in a [[campaign ad]] for then [[State Auditor of Missouri]] [[Claire McCaskill]] (D) in her [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2006|2006 Senate campaign]] against incumbent [[Jim Talent]] (R), expressing her support for [[stem cell]] research. In the ad, he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson's disease;
{{Quote box
 |quote = As you might know, I care deeply about stem cell research. In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures. Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us the chance for hope. They say all politics is local, but that's not always the case. What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans, Americans like me.
