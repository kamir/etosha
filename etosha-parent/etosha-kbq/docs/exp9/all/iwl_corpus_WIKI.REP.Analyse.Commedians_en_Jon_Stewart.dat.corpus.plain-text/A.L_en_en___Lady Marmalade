"'''Lady Marmalade'''" is a song by American [[girl group]] [[Labelle]]. It was written by [[Bob Crewe]] and [[Kenny Nolan]], and produced by [[Allen Toussaint]] and Vicki Wickham. It was released on August 3, 1974 as the first single from the album ''[[Nightbirds]]''. The song was inspired by Crewe's first-hand observations of New Orleans. After it was first recorded by Nolan's group Eleventh Hour in 1974, on ''Eleventh Hour's Greatest Hits'' LP, Labelle's producer [[Allen Toussaint]] decided to record it for ''Nightbirds''. The song is famous for its sexually suggestive chorus of "[[Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?|Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?]]", which translates into [[English language|English]] as "Do you want to go to bed with me (tonight)?"

The song held the number-one spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for one week, and topped the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart. Labelle's version of "Lady Marmalade" was inducted into the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients J-P|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame#l |title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame |publisher=GRAMMY.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> and was ranked number 479 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

The song has had many cover versions over the years. In 1998, girl group [[All Saints (band)|All Saints]] released a cover of the song that peaked at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The 2001 version by singers [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mýa]], and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], produced by [[Missy Elliott]] with instrumentals contributed by producer [[Rockwilder]], was released for the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' [[Moulin Rouge! Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film|soundtrack]]. It was a number-one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the US for 5 weeks and won Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa, and Pink a [[Grammy Award]]. In the United Kingdom, the song has been sung on several talent shows, including ''[[The X Factor (UK series 3)|The X Factor]]'' by [[Leona Lewis]], and on ''[[Eurovision: Your Country Needs You]]'' by [[Jade Ewen]].

==History==
[[Patti LaBelle]] sang lead vocals on "Lady Marmalade" with backing vocals being contributed by band mates [[Nona Hendryx]] and [[Sarah Dash]].  The song's chorus, "''Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?''",  appeared previously in the play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', uttered by the promiscuous [[Blanche DuBois]].

Lyrically, "Lady Marmalade" is about a [[prostitute]]. Patti LaBelle, the lead female vocal of the band, expressed that, "I didn't know what it was about. Nobody, I swear this is God's truth, nobody told me what I'd just sung a song about."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=UbsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=lady+marmalade+labelle&hl=vi&sa=X&ei=450FVLXGOMa48gXM8YDwCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=lady%20marmalade%20labelle&f=false|title=LaBelle Says Didn't Know Meaning Of 'Lady Marmalade'|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|page=8|volume=79|issue=21|date=March 11, 1991}}</ref>

Labelle performed "Lady Marmalade" on ''Soul Train'' on December 7, 1974.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Best of Soul Train Live |year=2011 |type=booklet |publisher=[[Time Life]]}}</ref> "Lady Marmalade" was a number-one hit for one week on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart in the United States during the early spring of 1975, and charted at number one for one week on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|Top Soul Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=337}}</ref> Along with the track, "What Can I Do for You?", "Lady Marmalade" peaked at number seven on the disco/dance charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=150}}</ref> The single also charted at number seventeen in the United Kingdom. "Lady Marmalade" replaced another Crewe/Nolan composition, Frankie Valli's "My Eyes Adored You", as the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single, a feat that made Crewe and Nolan the third songwriting team in ''Billboard'' history (after [[Lennon–McCartney]] and [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]]) to replace themselves at number-one.<ref>Bronson, Fred (2003, 5th ed.). ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits.'' New York: Billboard Books. ISBN 0-8230-7677-6</ref> ''Billboard'' ranked it as the No. 22 song for 1975.<ref>[[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1975]]</ref> Also in 1975, [[Nanette Workman]] recorded a French version that became very popular in Canada (Quebec).

The song was first covered by [[Nanette Workman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Nanette-Workman-Lady-Marmalade/release/1697583 |title=Nanette Workman - Lady Marmalade (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> in the same year, and then later on by [[Sheila E.]] on her 1991 album ''Sex Cymbal'' in a [[jazz]]-oriented rendition, with horns as the centerpiece. In 1995, disco cover band [[Dancing Fools|Boogie Knights]] covered "Lady Marmalade", fronted by singer [[Jeff Scott Soto]]. In 1999, the song was covered by the techno act [[Lords of Acid]] as a bonus track on their remix album ''Expand Your Head''. More recently, the track was featured in the TV series ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', performed by actor [[Andy Hallett]], and was released on [[Angel: Live Fast, Die Never|the soundtrack]] in 2005. The Labelle version appears in several films, including ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'', ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'', and ''[[Jacob's Ladder (film)|Jacob's Ladder]]''.

Improbably, the lyrics to the song were sung to the tune of the "[[Toreador Song]]" from "[[Carmen]]" by [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] on the radio comedy and panel game show ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' as part of a round called "[[One Song To The Tune Of Another|One Song to the Tune of Another]]". It was featured on the video game ''[[Karaoke Revolution Volume 2]]'' as a version performed with Patti LaBelle.

=== Background and release ===
In 2001, "Lady Marmalade" was featured as part of a medley in the film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''. For the film's soundtrack album, [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mýa]], and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] recorded a cover version; it was released as the soundtrack's first [[single (music)|single]] in spring 2001. Produced by [[Missy Elliott]] and writing partner [[Rockwilder]], it features an intro and outro from Elliott. A lyric was changed from the original version, with the song's setting being transferred from New Orleans to the [[Paris]] nightclub [[Moulin Rouge]]. The song became a number-one hit on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for the second time, reaching number one in its eighth week and spending five weeks at the top of the chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Watch Extra: Four-Way Collabos|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-four-way-collabos-221215705.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> It was the third song in ''Billboard'' chart history (after [[Aaliyah]]'s 2000 single "[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]" and [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]]'s 2001 single [[Angel (Shaggy song)|"Angel"]]) to hit number one without being released in a major commercially available single format. "Lady Marmalade" was Aguilera's fourth US number-one single and first-time number-ones for Kim, Pink, and Mýa in the US. For Aguilera, the song would be her last number one until 2011's "[[Moves like Jagger]]", a collaboration with [[Maroon 5]]. It would be Pink's only number-one hit until 2008, when her single "[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]" reached the top. It remained in the top forty for seventeen weeks in the US, and topped the charts in fifteen different countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia.The song also holds the record for the longest reigning no.1 on Billboard's [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart for an all female collaboration, topping the chart for nine consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Billbaord Chart Beat|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/268581/chart-beat-the-black-eyed-peas-jeremih-beyonce|accessdate= 31 July 2014}}</ref>"Lady Marmalade" is the best-selling single for Lil' Kim and Mýa. Lil' Kim also held the record for having the longest number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 for a female rapper, with "Lady Marmalade" being on the top of the charts for 5 consecutive weeks, until Australian female rapper [[Iggy Azalea]]'s [[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]] held on to the number one position for 7 weeks in 2014. The song was included on non-US versions of Aguilera's first greatest hits album, ''[[Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits]]''.
