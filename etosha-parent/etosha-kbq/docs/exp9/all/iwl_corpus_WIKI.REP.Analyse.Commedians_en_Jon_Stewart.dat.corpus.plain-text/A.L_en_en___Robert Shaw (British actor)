==Early life==
Robert Shaw was born in [[Westhoughton]], Lancashire<!---in 1927 Westhoughton was then still part of Lancashire, its now part of Greater Manchester--->, England, in 1927. His mother, Doreen (née Avery), was a former nurse born in [[Piggs Peak]], [[Swaziland]], and his father, Thomas Shaw, was a doctor.<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=Wakeman|first=John|authorlink=|author2=Stanley Kunitz |title= World authors, 1950–1970: a companion volume to Twentieth century authors|publisher=Wilson|year=1975|location=|page=1292|url=|isbn=0-8242-0419-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/playeraprofileof002609mbp/playeraprofileof002609mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The Player A Profile of an Art" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> He had three sisters, Elisabeth, Joanna, and Wendy, and one brother, Alexander (Sandy). When he was seven, the family moved to [[Stromness]], Orkney, Scotland. When Robert was 12, Thomas, an alcoholic, took his own life. The family then moved to [[Cornwall]], where he went to the independent [[Truro School]]. Shaw was a teacher in [[Saltburn-by-the-Sea]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]] for a brief period, then attended the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London. He served in the [[Royal Air Force]], air crew.

==Acting career==
Shaw began his acting career in theatre, appearing in regional theatre throughout England. In 1952 he made his London debut in the West End at the [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]], in ''[[Caro William]]''.

During the 1950s, Shaw starred in a British TV series which also appeared on American television as ''[[The Buccaneers (TV series)|The Buccaneers]]''. Shaw's best-known film performances include the assassin, [[List of James Bond henchmen in From Russia with Love|Donald Grant]], in the second [[James Bond]] film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), the title role in ''[[The Luck of Ginger Coffey (film)|The Luck of Ginger Coffey]],'' (1964), the relentless [[Panzer division|panzer]] German Army officer Colonel Hessler in ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965), a young [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966), [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], in [[Young Winston]]' [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in [[Custer of the West]] (1967), the ruthless mobster Doyle Lonnegan in ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973), the equally-ruthless subway-hijacker and hostage-taker "Mr. Blue" in ''[[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|The Taking of Pelham One Two Three]]'' (1974), the shark-obsessed fisherman Quint in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), lighthouse keeper and treasure-hunter Romer Treece in ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'' (1977), and the Israeli [[Mossad]] agent David Kabakov in ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]]'' (1977), which was the most successful of his appearances in films as the principal good-guy.

Shaw was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''.

He performed onstage as well, (he had a formidable, well-trained shouting voice) across Britain and on Broadway in the US,<ref>{{IBDB name|59762|Robert Shaw}}</ref> where his notable performances include [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Old Times]]''<ref>{{ibdb title|3624|Old Times}}</ref> and ''[[The Caretaker]]'',<ref>{{ibdb title|2879|The Caretaker}}</ref> [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''[[The Physicists]]'' directed by [[Peter Brook]],<ref>{{ibdb title|3218|The Physicist}}</ref> and ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'', inspired by the kidnapping and trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], written by Shaw himself, and directed by Pinter.<ref>{{ibdb title|3412|The Man in the Glass Booth}}</ref>

==Writing career==
In addition to his acting career, Shaw was also an accomplished writer of novels, plays and screenplays. His first novel, ''The Hiding Place'', published in 1960, met with positive reviews. His next, ''[[The Sun Doctor]]'', published the following year, was awarded the [[Hawthornden Prize]] in 1962.

Shaw then embarked on a trilogy of novels – ''[[The Flag (novel)|The Flag]]'' (1965), ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'' (1967) and ''[[A Card from Morocco]]'' (1969); it was his adaptation for the stage of ''The Man in the Glass Booth'' which gained him the most attention for his writing. The book and play present a complex and morally ambiguous tale of a man who, at various times in the story, is either a Jewish businessman pretending to be a Nazi war criminal, or a Nazi war criminal pretending to be a Jewish businessman. The play was quite controversial when performed in the UK and the US, some critics praising Shaw's sly, deft and complex examination of the moral issues of nationality and identity, others sharply critical of Shaw's treatment of such a sensitive subject. ''The Man in the Glass Booth'' was further developed for the screen but Shaw disapproved of the resulting film and had his name removed from the credits.

Shaw also adapted ''The Hiding Place'' into a screenplay for the film ''[[Situation Hopeless... But Not Serious]]'' starring [[Alec Guinness]]. His play ''[[Cato Street]]'', about the 1820 [[Cato Street Conspiracy]], was produced for the first time in 1971 in London.

==Death==
Shaw died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 28 August 1978 while driving from [[Castlebar]] to his home in [[Toormakeady|Tourmakeady, Ireland]]. He suddenly became ill, stopped the car, stepped out and then collapsed on the roadside. He was rushed to [[Mayo General Hospital|Castlebar General Hospital]] and was pronounced dead aged 51.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ioNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yQsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2322,6107923&dq=robert-shaw+1978&hl=en|title=Robert Shaw, British Actor, Dies in Ireland|date=29 August 1978|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref><ref>David Parkinson, "Shaw, Robert Archibald (1927–1978)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press'' 2004; online edition 2007</ref> He had just completed filming of ''[[Avalanche Express]]''.
