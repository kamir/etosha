'''Margaret Julia''' "'''Marlo'''" '''Thomas''' (born November 21, 1937) is an American actress, producer, and social activist known for starring on the sitcom ''[[That Girl]]'' (1966–1971) and her award-winning feminist children's franchise, ''[[Free to Be... You and Me]]''. For her work in television, she has received four Emmys, a Golden Globe, the George Foster Peabody Award and has been inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame. She has also received a Grammy award for her children’s album ''Thanks & Giving All Year Long.''

Thomas serves as National Outreach Director for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], which was founded by her father, [[Danny Thomas]], in 1962. She created the Thanks & Giving campaign in 2004 to support the hospital.

==Early life==
Thomas was born on November 21, 1937 in [[Detroit, Michigan]], the eldest child of comedian [[Danny Thomas]] (1912–1991) and his wife, the former Rose Marie Cassaniti (1914–2000). She has a sister, Terre, and her brother, [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]], is a television and film producer. Her father was [[Lebanese American]] and her mother was [[Sicilian American]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marlo-thomas/international-no-diet-day_b_5269218.html|title=International No Diet Day: When Temptation Calls...|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>

Marlo Thomas was raised in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Her parents called her Margo as a child, though she soon became known as Marlo, she told ''The New York Times'', because of her childhood mispronunciation of the nickname.  She attended [[Marymount High School]] in Los Angeles. Thomas graduated from the [[University of Southern California]] with a teaching degree: "I wanted a piece of paper that said I was qualified to do something in the world," she said. She also was a member of the sorority [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].<ref name="stone">{{cite news| author=Judy Stone| title=And Now—Make Room for Marlo| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C17F83455117B93C6A91782D85F428685F9| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=September 4, 1966| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Thomas appeared in many early TV shows including ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[Arrest and Trial]]'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', and ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', among others. Her big break came in 1965 when she was cast by Mike Nichols in the London production of Neil Simon’s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]],'' co-starring Daniel Massey, Kurt Kasner and Mildred Natwick. In 1986 she was once again cast by Nichols on Broadway in Andrew Bergman’s ''[[Social Security (play)|Social Security]],'' co-starring Ron Silver and Olympia Dukakis.

===''That Girl''===
[[File:Marlo Thomas That Girl 1969.JPG|thumb|Thomas (center) with co-star [[Ted Bessell]] (left) in a 1969 photo from ''[[That Girl]]'']]

Thomas starred in an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] pilot called ''Two's Company'' in 1965. Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of an ABC programming executive. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show about a young woman who leaves home, moves to [[New York City|New York]] and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic. Thomas, however, ensured the show's success and it was put into production.

The concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled ''[[That Girl]]'', in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by [[Ted Bessell]]. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The series was the first television show to focus on a working, single girl who did not live with her parents, and paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the second woman, following [[Lucille Ball]], to produce her own series. ''That Girl'' aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the [[Nielsen ratings]].

In 1971 Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show's sponsor, Clairol, wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters. But Thomas rebuffed them, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is a marriage. ''That Girl'' has since become popular in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]].

===Later career===
After ''That Girl'', eager to expand her horizons, Thomas attended the [[Actors Studio]],<ref>{{cite news| author=Judith Michaelson| title=Q&A with Marlo Thomas: 'In the Prime of My Craft Now'| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-07/entertainment/ca-1267_1_marlo-thomas/2| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=November 7, 1992| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=September 7, 2012}}</ref> where she studied with [[Lee Strasberg]] until his death in 1982, and subsequently with Strasberg's disciple [[Sandra Seacat]]. When she won her Best Dramatic Actress Emmy in 1986 for the TV-movie ''Nobody’s Child,'' she thanked both individuals.
[[File:Marlo Thomas at the 1989 Emmy Awards.jpg|160px|thumb|Thomas at the 41st Primetime Emmy Awards, September 17, 1989]]

In 1972 she released a children's book, ''[[Free to Be... You and Me]]'', which was inspired by her young niece Dionne Gordon. She went on to create multiple recordings and television specials of and related to that title: ''Free to Be... You and Me'' (1972, 1974) and ''[[Free to Be... A Family]]'' (1987), with [[Christopher Cerf]]. Also in 1972, she served as a California delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.

In 1973 Thomas joined [[Gloria Steinem]], Patricia Carbine, and [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]] as the founders of the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]], the first women’s fund in the U.S. The organization was created to deliver funding and other resources to organizations that were presenting liberal women’s voices in communities nationwide.

In 1976 Thomas made a guest appearance on the [[NBC]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[The Practice (1976 TV series)|The Practice]]'' as a stubborn patient of her father Danny Thomas{{'}}s character Dr. Jules Bedford, and the chemistry of father and daughter acting together made for touching hospital-room scenes.

Adept at [[drama]] as well as [[comedy]], Thomas appeared in the television movies ''[[It Happened One Christmas]]'' (1977) (a remake of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''),<ref name="maltin">{{cite book| author=Leonard Maltin, ed.| title=TV Movies Video Guide 1991 Edition| publisher=Signet Books| date=October 1990| isbn=0-451-16748-1}}</ref> ''Consenting Adult'' (1985), ''Nobody's Child'' (1986), ''The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck'' (1984), ''Held Hostage: The Sis and Jerry Levin Story'' (1991), ''Reunion'' (1994), ''Deceit'' (2004) and ''Ultimate Betrayal'' (1994); while she starred in the films ''[[Jenny (TV movie)|Jenny]]'' (1970), ''[[Thieves (1977 film)|Thieves]]'' (1977), ''In The Spirit'' (1990), ''The Real Blonde'' (1997), ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]'' (1999), ''Playing Mona Lisa'' (2000), ''LOL'' (2010) with [[Demi Moore]] and [[Miley Cyrus]] and ''Cardboard Boxer'' (2014).

Thomas's [[Broadway theatre]] credits include ''[[Thieves (play)|Thieves]]'' (1974), ''[[Social Security (play)|Social Security]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Shadow Box]]'' (1994), and in 2011 she starred as Doreen in [[Elaine May]]'s comedy ''George Is Dead,'' in an evening of three one-act plays entitled ''Relatively Speaking.'' The other two plays were written by [[Woody Allen]] and [[Coen brothers|Ethan Coen]].

[[File:Marlo Thomas 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas in 2008]]
Off Broadway, Thomas has appeared in ''The Guys'' and ''The Exonerated'' (in which she also appeared in Chicago and Boston, co-starring with [[Brian Dennehy]]). Regional Theatre productions include: ''[[Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Wolff?]]'' at the Hartford Stage; ''Woman In Mind'' at the Berkshire Theatre Festival; ''Paper Doll,'' with F. Murray Abraham at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre; and ''The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'' at the Cleveland Playhouse. In 1993 she toured in the National Company of ''Six Degrees of Separation.'' In the spring of 2008 she starred in Arthur Laurents's last play, ''New Year's Eve'' with [[Keith Carradine]], at the George Street Playhouse.

Thomas has published six best-selling books: ''Free To Be ..You and Me,'' ''Free To Be A Family,'' ''The Right Words at the Right Time,'' ''The Right Words at the Right Time, Volume 2: Your Turn,'' ''Thanks & Giving All Year Long,'' and in 2009 her memoir, ''Growing Up Laughing.''

Thomas also is active with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where she serves as the national outreach director. She donated all royalties from her 2004 book and CD, ''Thanks & Giving: All Year Long'' (also produced with Cerf), to the hospital, which was started by her late father, Danny Thomas.

In recent years Thomas has made guest appearances on ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[Friends]]'' (as Rachel's mother, Sandra Green), as well as on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (she played Judge Mary Conway Clark, a mentor of ADA [[Casey Novak]]).

She currently narrates the series ''[[Happily Never After]]'' on [[Investigation Discovery]].

In 2010 Thomas created MarloThomas.com, a website for women aged 35+ on AOL and the Huffington Post.
