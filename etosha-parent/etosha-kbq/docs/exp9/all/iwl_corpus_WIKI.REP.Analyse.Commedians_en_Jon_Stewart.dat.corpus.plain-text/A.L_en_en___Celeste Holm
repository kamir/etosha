'''Celeste Holm''' (April 29, 1917 – July 15, 2012) was an American stage, film and television actress.<ref name=obit/>

Holm won an [[Academy Award]] for her performance in ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), and was Oscar nominated for her roles in ''[[Come to the Stable]]'' (1949) and ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950). She originated the role of Ado Annie in the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943).<ref name=obit/>

==Early life==
Born and raised in Manhattan, Holm was an only child. Her mother, Jean Parke, was an American portrait artist and author; her father, Theodor Holm, was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] businessman whose company provided marine adjustment services for [[Lloyd's of London]]. Because of her parents' occupations, she traveled often during her youth and attended various schools in the Netherlands, France and the United States. She graduated from University High School for Girls in Chicago, where she performed in many school stage productions. She then studied drama at the [[University of Chicago]] before becoming a stage actress in the late 1930s.

==Career==
[[File:Studio publicity Celeste Holm.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo, c.1940]]
Holm's first professional theatrical role was in a production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' starring [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]. She first appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in a small part in ''Gloriana'' (1938), a comedy which lasted for only five performances, but her first major part on Broadway was in [[William Saroyan]]'s revival of ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' (1940) as Mary L. with fellow newcomer [[Gene Kelly]]. The role that got her the most recognition from critics and audiences was as Ado Annie in the premiere production of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' in 1943.

After she starred in the Broadway production of ''[[Bloomer Girl]]'', [[20th Century Fox]] signed Holm to a movie contract in 1946. She made her film debut that same year in ''[[Three Little Girls in Blue]]'', making a startling entrance in a “Technicolor red” dress singing “Always a Lady,” a belting Ado Annie-type song, although the character was different—a lady.  In 1947 she won an Oscar and Golden Globe for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] in ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]''.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9401824/Celeste-Holm.html Obituary: Celeste Holm], ''Daily Telegraph'', 15 July 2012</ref> After another supporting role in ''[[All About Eve]]'', however, Holm realized she preferred live theater to movie work, and only accepted a few select film roles over the next decade. The most successful of these were the comedy ''[[The Tender Trap (film)|The Tender Trap]]'' (1955) and the musical ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), both of which co-starred [[Frank Sinatra]]. She starred as a professor-turned-reporter in [[New York City]] in the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[Honestly, Celeste!]]'' (fall 1954) and was thereafter a panelist on ''Who Pays?'' (1959). She also appeared several times on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1958, she starred as a reporter in an unsold television pilot called ''The Celeste Holm Show'', based on the book ''No Facilities for Women''. Holm also starred in the musical ''[[The Utter Glory of Morrissey Hall]]''. In 1965, she played the Fairy Godmother alongside [[Lesley Ann Warren]] in the CBS production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)#1965 version|Cinderella]]''. In 1970-71, she was featured on the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]  sitcom ''[[Nancy (TV series)|Nancy]]'', with Renne Jarrett, [[John Fink]] and [[Robert F. Simon]]. In the story line, Holm played Abby Townsend, the [[press secretary]] of the [[First Lady of the United States]] and the chaperone of Jarrett's character, Nancy Smith, the President's daughter.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Holm did more screen acting, with roles in films such as ''[[Tom Sawyer (1973 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' and ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'', and in television series (often as a guest star) such as ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' and ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. In 1979, she played the role of First Lady Florence Harding in the television mini-series, ''[[Backstairs at the White House]]''. She was a regular on the ABC soap opera ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'', appearing first in 1986 in the role of Lydia Woodhouse and again as Isabelle Dwyer Alden #2 from 1991 to 1992. She last appeared on television in the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] television series ''[[Promised Land (TV series)|Promised Land]]'' (1996–99).

==Honors==

A life member of [[Actors Studio|The Actors Studio]],<ref>{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=278|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}</ref> Holm received numerous honors during her lifetime, including the 1968 [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for distinguished achievement in [[Chicago theatre]]; she was appointed to the National Arts Council by then-President [[Ronald Reagan]], appointed Knight, First Class of the [[Order of St. Olav]] by [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav]] of [[Norway]] in 1979,<ref>"Ridder av St. Olav", ''Aftenposten'', morning edition 21. May 1979, p. 10.</ref> and inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]] in 1992. She remained active for social causes as a spokesperson for [[UNICEF]], and for occasional professional engagements.  From 1995 she was Chairman of the Board of Arts Horizons, a not-for-profit arts-in-education organization.

In 2006, Holm was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the SunDeis Film Festival at [[Brandeis University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/sundeis/welcome.html|title=SunDeis 2006|accessdate=2007-10-29|work=SunDeis Film Festival web site|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060910155056/http://www.brandeis.edu/sundeis/welcome.html|archivedate=2006-09-10}}</ref>

Holm was a guest at the 2009 Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in [[Aberdeen, Maryland]]. Some of the movies in which she appeared were screened at the festival, and the un-aired [[television pilot]] for ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' was shown. She received an honorary award during the dinner banquet at the close of the event.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Celeste Holm 1988.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Attending the Academy Awards in 1988]]

*Holm's first marriage was to [[Ralph Nelson]] in 1936.<ref>[http://www.superiorpics.com/celeste_holm Celeste Holm profile at www.superiorpics.com]</ref> Their son, Internet pioneer and sociologist [[Ted Nelson]] (born 1937), was raised by his maternal grandparents. The marriage ended in 1939. In his 2010 memoir, ''Possiplex,'' her son, credited with coining the term “hypertext,” described this and other choices as “entirely the right decisions.” He reportedly did not name his mother in the book.<ref name=holmandbasile>{{cite news|author=[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]]|title=Love and Inheritance: A Family Feud|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/nyregion/love-and-inheritance-celeste-holms-family-feud.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=July 2, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref>

*Holm married Francis Emerson Harding Davies, an English auditor, on January 7, 1940. Davies was a [[Roman Catholic]], and she was received into the Roman Catholic Church for the purposes of their 1940 wedding; the marriage was dissolved on May 8, 1945.<ref>[http://www.superiorpics.com/celeste_holm Holm profile at www.superiorpics.com]</ref>

*From 1946 to 1952, Holm was married to airline public relations executive A. Schuyler Dunning, with whom she had a second son, businessman Daniel Dunning.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff writers|title=Births, deaths, marriages, divorces|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,806408,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1952-05-12|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>

*From 1961 to 1996, she was married to actor [[Wesley Addy]] (1913–1996), until his death at age 83 in 1996.

*On April 29, 2004, her 87th birthday, Holm married opera singer Frank Basile, age 41.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kenneth|last=Jones|title=December Bride: Shocking Guests, Celeste Holm Marries Beau at 85th Birthday Party|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/december-bride-shocking-guests-celeste-holm-marries-beau-at-85th-birthday-p-119461|work=[[Playbill]]|date=2004-04-30}}</ref> The couple met in October 1999 at a fundraiser at which Basile was hired to sing. Soon after their marriage, Holm and Basile sued to overturn the irrevocable trust that was created in 2002 by Daniel Dunning, Holm's younger son. The trust was ostensibly set up to shelter Holm's financial assets from taxes though Basile contended the real purpose of the trust was to keep him away from her money. The lawsuit began a five-year battle with her sons, which cost millions of dollars, and according to an article in ''The New York Times,'' left Holm and her husband with a fragile hold on their apartment, which Holm purchased for $10,000 cash in 1953 from her film earnings, and which is now believed to be worth at least $10,000,000.<ref name="holmandbasile"/>

==Health and death==
According to her husband, Holm had been treated for memory loss since 2002, suffered skin cancer, bleeding ulcers and a collapsed lung, and had hip replacements and pacemakers.<ref name=holmandbasile/>

In June 2012, Holm was admitted to New York's [[Roosevelt Hospital]] with dehydration. She suffered a heart attack on July 13, 2012 in the facility. She died at her Central Park West apartment on July 15, 2012.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author=Anita Gates |coauthors= |title=Celeste Holm, Witty Character Actress, Is Dead at 95 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/theater/celeste-holm-witty-character-actress-dies-at-95.html |quote=Celeste Holm, the New York-born actress who made an indelible Broadway impression as an amorous country girl in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Oklahoma!,” earned an Academy Award as the knowing voice of tolerance in “Gentleman’s Agreement” and went on to a six-decade screen and stage career, frequently cast as the wistful or brittle sophisticate, died early Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 95. Her death was announced by Amy Phillips, a great-niece. Ms. Holm had a heart attack at Roosevelt Hospital in New York last week while being treated there for dehydration, but she was taken home on Friday. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=July 15, 2012 |accessdate=2014-12-23 }}</ref>

She was survived by husband Frank Basile and her sons and grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/15/celeste-holm-dead-oscar-winner-dies_n_1674512.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Oscar-Winning Actress Celeste Holm Dies At 95 | date=July 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>http://todayentertainment.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/15/12752807-oscar-winning-actress-celeste-holm-dies-at-95?lite</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/09/fire-at-robert-de-niros-n_n_1583205.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Fire At Robert De Niro's NYC Apartment; No Injuries | date=June 9, 2012}}</ref>
