The ever-optimistic Joline ([[Heather Graham]]) faces a challenge when her husband, flaky news photographer Carl ([[Luke Wilson]]), leaves her to find himself in Texas. Joline tracks Carl down and observes him, acquainting herself with his schedule and new friends (including his new girlfriend, Carmen ([[Patricia Velásquez]]) and his quirky neighbor, Niko ([[Goran Visnjic]]). Eventually Carl spots Joline, and Joline seeks new ways of returning Carl to her life, up to and including mystic remedies provided by Carmen's grandfather. Eventually Joline is committed, hence the title, and her belief in true and lasting love is broken... or is it?
