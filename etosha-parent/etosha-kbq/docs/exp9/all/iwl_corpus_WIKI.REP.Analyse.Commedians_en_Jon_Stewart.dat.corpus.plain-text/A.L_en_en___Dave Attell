'''Dave Attell''' (born January 18, 1965) is an American stand-up comedian, writer and actor, best known as the host of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]''<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/156702/Insomniac-With-Dave-Attell/overview|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Insomniac with Dave Attell}}</ref> and ''[[The Gong Show with Dave Attell]]''. Born in [[Queens]], New York, he grew up in [[Rockville Centre, New York]] and now lives in New York City.

==Stand-up career==
After graduating from [[New York University]] in 1987 with a degree in communications, Attell worked menial jobs during the day and put in his time at comedy clubs at night. He worked his first gig at Governor's in [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] and, according to Attell, "totally bombed".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Attell's first appearance on television was in 1988 on [[VH1]]'s ''Stand-Up Spotlight,'' which also featured early appearances by [[Lewis Black]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Jay Mohr]] and [[Wanda Sykes]]. The show was hosted by [[Rosie O'Donnell]].

Perhaps his biggest break was achieved on November 23, 1993, when he made his first appearance on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]''. The appearance was seen by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]], who then recruited Attell to be a writer, and occasional performer, on ''SNL''. Attell can be seen behind [[Chris Farley]] during the famous "[[Rudy Giuliani]] Inauguration" sketch. Attell worked on the show for the '93–'94 season.

In 1995, Attell was featured on two [[HBO]] specials: alongside up-and-comers [[Louis C.K.]], [[Anthony Clark (actor)|Anthony Clark]], [[Eric Tunney]] and [[Dave Chappelle]], he was a featured performer on the 1995 ''Young Comedians Special'', hosted by [[Garry Shandling]]. He was also given his own 60-minute special on the channel's ''HBO Comedy Showcase''. Subsequently, Attell was also given an episode of ''[[HBO Comedy Half-Hour]]'' in 1997.

Attell's first one-hour special, ''Captain Miserable'', aired December 8, 2007 on [[HBO]].

==Television==

In 1995, Attell appeared as Squiggly Dave on ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]''. In 1999 the network issued Attell an installment in their ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' series.

The same year the network signed him on as a regular commentator on their satirical news show ''[[The Daily Show]]''. When he arrived in 1999, the show was just finding its audience after the departure of host [[Craig Kilborn]] and the arrival of [[Jon Stewart]], an old friend of Attell's from the New York comedy circuit. The three-year stint gave Attell access to a mass audience on a regular basis (''The Daily Show'' has done much the same for comedians [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Lewis Black]] and others). Attell's series of commentary on the show was called "The Ugly American".

In 2003, Attell began appearing semi-regularly on ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]''. The show featured many of the performers he works with every day at the underground comedy club the [[Comedy Cellar]] and is based on the conversations they would have off-stage at the Olive Tree Cafe, the restaurant above the club. The unscripted show was canceled in November 2004.

In 2007, Attell appeared in the Michael Addis film, ''[[Heckler (film)|Heckler]]''. Attell also appeared on Comedy Central's ''Last Laugh'' in 2007.

In July 2008, Attell began hosting ''The Gong Show with Dave Attell'' for [[Comedy Central]]. Like the [[The Gong Show|1970's version]], the show had a rotating panel of celebrity judges grading unusual acts.<ref name="urlThe Gong Show with Dave Attell| Comedy Central">{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/gong_show/index.jhtml|title=The Gong Show with Dave Attell|work=[[Comedy Central]]}}</ref><ref name="urlThe Gong Show with Dave Attell Television show - The Gong Show with Dave Attell TV Show - Yahoo!

In May 2008, Attell announced a casting call on his MySpace page for Comedy Central's relaunch of The Gong Show. Attell was host, along with Greg Fitzsimmons serving as head writer on the series. However, The Gong Show with Dave Attell aired only from July to September 2008.

Attell returned to television on Showtime beginning October 20, 2011 in [[Dave's Old Porn]], a TV series in which Attell views and jokes about retro 70's/80's pornographic movies with different guest comedians. Typically, during a given show, Attell and his guest view clips that give an overview of a particular retro porn star's career. Near the end of that show, that particular porn actor appears and also comments on clips from some of his/her movies.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wetherbee|first=Brandon|title=Dave Attell, 'Dave's Old Porn' Host, Heads to the DC Improv|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/dave-attell-porn-dc-improv_n_2213303.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=April 27, 2013|date=November 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Insomniac with Dave Attell===
''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' was a television series<ref name=NYT/> described by Attell as "''[[Wild On!|Wild on E!]]'' for Ugly People", it featured Attell walking the streets of America's cities late at night, meeting the people in a haze of ecstatic inebriation. The show occasionally went overseas.

The American cities featured on the show were [[Albuquerque]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Atlanta]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] (2 times), [[Baltimore]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Boston]], [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston (WV)]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], Chicago, [[Cleveland]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Honolulu]], [[Houston]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Key West]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Little Rock]], [[Long Island]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Miami, [[Myrtle Beach]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[New Orleans]], New York City (4 times), [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], San Francisco, and [[Salt Lake City]].

The foreign cities featured on the show were [[Amsterdam]], Dublin, London, Montreal, [[Tijuana]], Toronto, and specials that took place in [[Berlin]], Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo.

The most common activity (besides roaming the street aimlessly and visiting bars) was visiting workers on their night shifts. Instead of spending time with gas station attendants, he went searching for odd professions to highlight. Among them were crime-scene cleaners, bail bondsmen, cow-milkers, brothel-hookers, bicycle cops, coal miners, and porn overdubbers. Memorable episodes include a visit to Chicago's world-famous [[The Wieners Circle]], where the staff routinely got in cursing matches with their customers, and a visit to a Phoenix nudist camp.

Throughout the run of the show, Attell carried around a one-time-use film camera and took pictures of random events, which would be shown during the end-credits.
