'''Armando Giovanni Iannucci''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ({{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|m|æ|n|d|oʊ|_|j|ə|ˈ|n|uː|tʃ|i}}; born 28 November 1963) is an Oscar and Emmy-nominated Scottish<ref>{{cite news|title=Tucker v McBride: When satire met reality| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/tucker-v-mcbride-when-satire-met-reality-1668742.html?action=Gallery&ino=2 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090417001000/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/tucker-v-mcbride-when-satire-met-reality-1668742.html | archivedate=4 April 2013 | location=London | work=The Independent}}</ref> satirist, writer, television director and radio producer of Italian descent. Born in Glasgow, he studied at [[Oxford University]] and left graduate work on a PhD about [[John Milton]] to pursue a career in comedy. 

Rising quickly through [[BBC Scotland]] and [[BBC Radio 4]], his early work with [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] on the radio series ''[[On the Hour]]'' was transferred to television as ''[[The Day Today]]''. A character from this series, Alan Partridge, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programmes including ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (disambiguation)|Knowing Me, Knowing You]]'' and ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]''. In the meantime, Iannucci also fronted the satirical ''[[Saturday Night Armistice|Armistice]]'' review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, ''[[The Armando Iannucci Shows]]'', for Channel 4.<ref name=BFI>{{Screenonline name|id=1182836|name=Armando Iannucci biography and credits}}</ref>

Moving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom ''[[The Thick of It]]'' as well as the spoof documentary ''[[Time Trumpet]]'' in 2006.<ref name=BFI/> Winning funding from the UK Film Council, he directed a critically acclaimed feature film ''[[In the Loop (film)|In the Loop]]'' featuring characters from ''The Thick of It'' in 2009. As a result of these works, he has been described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "the hardman of political satire".<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6409167/Armando-Iannucci-interview.html Armando Iannucci interview], 23 October 2009</ref> Other works during this period include an operetta libretto, ''Skin Deep'', and his radio series ''Charm Offensive''. 

Iannucci's latest television project is the [[HBO]] political satire ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''. In March 2012 it was announced that he is working on his first novel, ''Tongue International'', described as 'a satirical fantasy about a privatised language'.<ref name=Chortle>{{cite web| url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/03/30/15144/armando_iannucci_writes_his_first_novel |publisher=Chortle |title=Armando Iannucci writes his first novel |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>

Iannucci was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland.

Armando has two brothers and a sister. He was educated at St Peter's Primary School, [[St. Aloysius' College, Glasgow]], the [[University of Glasgow]]<ref name="BBC Comedy">{{cite web|title=BBC Comedy – Armando Iannucci|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/iannucci/|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> and [[University College, Oxford]], where he read [[English literature]] gaining an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview: Armando Iannucci, writer and director|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/interview-armando-iannucci-writer-and-director-1-2374221|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> In his teens he thought seriously about becoming a Roman Catholic priest.<ref>Tatler http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/i/armando-ianucci</ref>  He abandoned graduate work on 17th-century religious language, with particular reference to [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', to pursue his career in comedy.

== Career ==

===1990s===
After making several programmes at [[BBC Scotland]] in the early 1990s such as ''No' The Archie McPherson Show'', he moved to BBC Radio in London, making radio shows including ''Armando Iannucci'' for BBC Radio 1, which featured a number of comedians he was to collaborate with for many years, including [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]], [[Peter Baynham]], [[Steve Coogan]] and [[Rebecca Front]]. 

Iannucci first received widespread fame as the producer for ''[[On the Hour]]'' on Radio 4, which soon transferred to television as ''[[The Day Today]]''. He received critical acclaim for both his own talents as a writer and a producer, and for first bringing together such comics as [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], [[Richard Herring]], [[Stewart Lee]], [[Peter Baynham]] and [[Steve Coogan]]. The members of this group went on to work on separate projects and create a new comedy "wave" pre-[[New Labour]]: Morris went on to create ''[[Brass Eye]]'', ''[[Blue Jam]]'' and the ''Chris Morris Music Show''; Stewart Lee and Richard Herring created ''[[Fist of Fun]]'' and ''[[This Morning with Richard Not Judy]]''.

Baynham was closely involved with both Morris's and [[Lee & Herring]]'s work – simultaneously at one point. Lee would go on to co-write the controversial ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'', but perhaps the most famous "alumnus" of this group is [[Steve Coogan]]'s character [[Alan Partridge]], who first appeared in ''On the Hour'', and has featured in multiple spin-off series.
Between 1995 and 1999, Iannucci produced and hosted ''[[The Saturday Night Armistice]]''.

===2000s===
In 2000, he created two pilot episodes for Channel 4, which became ''[[The Armando Iannucci Shows]]''. This was an eight-part series for Channel 4 broadcast in 2001, written with [[Andy Riley]] and [[Kevin Cecil]]. The series consisted of Iannucci pondering pseudo-philosophical and jocular ideas and fantasies inbetween surreal sketches. Iannucci has been quoted as saying it is the comedy series he is most proud of making. He told ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|The Metro]]'' in April 2007 "''The Armando Iannucci Show''{{sic}} on Channel 4 came out around [[9/11]], so it was overlooked for good reasons. People had other things on their minds. But that was the closest to me expressing my comic outlook on life."<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=43694&in_page_id=11 60 SEONDS: Armando Iannucci]{{sic}} at Metro.co.uk, Sunday, 1 April 2007</ref>

After championing ''[[Yes Minister]]'' on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]'', Iannucci devised, directed and was chief writer of ''[[The Thick of It]]'', a political satire-cum-farce for [[BBC Four]].<ref name="BBC Comedy"/> It starred [[Chris Langham]] as an incompetent cabinet minister being manipulated by a cynical Press Officer, played by [[Peter Capaldi]] and based on [[Tony Blair]]'s former Press Secretary [[Alastair Campbell]]. The series was broadcast in two-parts in 2005 before an expanded cast starred in two specials and a "third" series.

Based on a format he had used in ''[[Clinton: His Struggle with Dirt]]'' in 1996 and ''[[2004: The Stupid Version]]'', in mid-2006, his spoof documentary series ''[[Time Trumpet]]'' was shown on BBC 2. The series looked back on past events through highly edited clips and "celebrity" interviews, looking back on the present and near-future from the year 2031. One episode, featuring fictional terrorist attacks on London and the assassination of Tony Blair, was postponed and edited in August 2006 amid the [[August 10, 2006 alleged transatlantic aircraft terrorist plot|terrorism scares]] in British airports at that time. [[Jane Thynne]], writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', accused the BBC of lacking backbone.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/why-should-newspapers-cost-less-money-than-a-coffee-412550.html MEDIA DIARY – The war on humour]</ref>

A recent US television project is the [[HBO]] political satire ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]'', starring [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], set in the [[Office of the Vice President of the United States|office]] of [[Selina Meyer]], a fictional Vice-President of the United States.<ref name=Parker2012/> ''Veep'' uses a similar [[Cinéma vérité#Cinéma-vérité style films and television shows|cinéma-vérité]] filming style to ''The Thick of It''. Three seasons have so far been produced or planned, running between 2012 and 2014.

===Other work===
Ianucci's non-television works include ''Smokehammer'', a web-based project with Chris Morris, and the 1997 book ''Facts and Fancies'', composed of his newspaper columns, which was turned into a [[BBC Radio 4]] series. The radio series ''Scraps With Iannucci'', which followed late in 1998, featured Iannucci using his tape-fiddling skills to present a review of the year. 

He has appeared on Radio 3 talking about classical music, one of his passions, and collaborated with composer [[David Sawer]] on ''Skin Deep'', an [[operetta]], which was premiered by [[Opera North]] on 16 January 2009. He has also presented three programmes for [[BBC Radio 3]], including ''Mobiles Off!'', a 20-minute segment on classical concert-going etiquette. He was a regular columnist for the classical music magazine ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]''.<ref name=Parker2012>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ian|title=Expletives not deleted|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/26/120326fa_fact_parker|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=26 March 2012}}</ref> 

He directed a series of [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]] television adverts, featuring the actors [[John Henshaw]], [[Rory Jennings]] and [[Di Botcher]] alongside guest stars such as [[Joan Collins]], [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Westlife]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/advertising/story/0,,2189979,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Joan Collins in Post Office ad | date=12 October 2007 | accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref>

He has also been working on his first novel, ''Tongue International'', a satirical fantasy about the promotion of a "for-profit language".<ref name=Chortle/><ref name=Parker2012/>

===Film directing===
In January 2009, his first feature film ''[[In the Loop (film)|In the Loop]]'', in the style of ''[[The Thick of It]]'', was premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was the first cinema film to be directed by Iannucci, after his contribution to ''[[Tube Tales]]'' in 1999. The film has been applauded by critics, both in Britain and the US,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5554802.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=In the Loop at the Sundance Film Festival Utah | first=Damon | last=Wise | date=21 January 2009 | accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] Oscar in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominees for the 82nd Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/82/nominees.html|work=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100204215537/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/82/nominees.html| archivedate= 4 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>
The film secured the eighth highest placing in the UK box office in its opening week – despite its relatively insignificant screening numbers. According to the British Film Institute [[screenonline]], Iannucci had previously failed to secure funding for a historical comedy film in 2003.<ref name="BFI"/>

Iannucci used his BBC press pass to enter the [[US State Department]] headquarters whilst researching the film, saying how he just turned up and claimed to be "here for the 12.30". Iannucci spent an hour inside taking photographs which were used for the film's set designs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comedian sneaks into US State department|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5295148/Comedian-sneaks-into-US-State-department.html|work=[[telegraph.co.uk]]|date=8 May 2009|accessdate=8 May 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090511043257/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5295148/Comedian-sneaks-into-US-State-department.html| archivedate= 11 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Recognition==
Iannucci has won two [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]] and three [[British Comedy Awards]]. In 2003, he was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1101525,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The A-Z of laughter (part two) | date=7 December 2003 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> He was also subject of a 2006 edition of ''[[The South Bank Show]]''.

In January 2006 he was named [[News International]] Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media at the [[University of Oxford]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Armando Iannucci to lecture at Oxford on British comedy|url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/060118.shtml|publisher=[[University of Oxford|ox.ac.uk]]|date=18 January 2006}}"</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Armando Iannucci named as Oxford University's next Broadcast Media Professor|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2005/051102.html|publisher=[[University of Oxford|ox.ac.uk]]|date=2 November 2005}}</ref> where he has delivered a series of four lectures under the title "British Comedy – Dead Or Alive?".

In June 2011, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] by the [[University of Glasgow]] to recognise his contribution to film and television.

At the 2011 British Comedy Awards, Iannucci received the Writers' Guild of Britain Award.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8962988/British-Comedy-Awards-2011-Inbetweeners-and-Victoria-Wood-among-winners.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=British Comedy Awards 2011: Inbetweeners and Victoria Wood among winners | date=17 December 2011}}</ref>

In July 2012 Iannucci received an honorary Doctorate (DLitt) from the University of Exeter.

==Personal life and politics==
In 1990, he married Rachael Jones, whom he met when she designed the lighting for his one-man show at Oxford.<ref>Alexia Skinitis, "[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article6044158.ece Armando Iannucci – Significant Others], ''The Times'', 11 April 2009</ref> They have two sons and one daughter and currently live in Hertfordshire, having previously lived in Buckinghamshire.<ref name=RTSep2012>Dougary, Ginny (8–14 September 2012), "The politics of humour", ''Radio Times'', Vol 354 no 4608, Immediate Media Company, London, p.23.</ref>

He is patron of the Silver Star Society, a charity supporting women through difficult pregnancies. In April 2012 he [[Abseiling|abseiled]] from the top of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to raise money for the hospital's specialist pregnancy unit.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/9663618.Comedian_takes_plunge_to_aid_baby_unit/ |work=The Oxford Mail |title=Comedian takes plunge to aid baby unit |author= Jones, Laura |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>

In the 2010 general election he supported the [[Liberal Democrats]], stating: "I'll be voting Lib Dem this election because they represent the best chance in a lifetime to make lasting and fair change to how the UK is governed."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/a-whorsquos-who-of-celebrity-political-endorsements-1962049.html?action=Popup&ino=21 A who’s who of celebrity political endorsements], ''The Independent'', retrieved 3 May 2010</ref> After the [[First Cameron ministry|Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition of 2010]] was established, however, he expressed doubts over his continued support for the party, saying he was 'wavering' on many issues and has admitted to 'queasiness' over the Coalition's economic measures. He also seemed to contemplate targeting the Liberal Democrats in the fourth series of ''The Thick of It'', rather as the first three had targeted what he perceived as the failings within the Labour governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/23/armando-iannucci-interview-coalition-cuts].
