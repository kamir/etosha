'''Douglas Fairbanks''' (May 23, 1883 &ndash; December 12, 1939) was an American actor, screenwriter, director, and producer.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', December 13, 1939, p. 54.</ref> He was best known for his [[swashbuckler film|swashbuckling]] roles in [[silent film]]s such as ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'', and ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' but spent the early part of his career making comedies.

An astute businessman, Fairbanks was a founding member of [[United Artists]]. Fairbanks was also a founding member of [[AMPAS|The Motion Picture Academy]] and hosted the first [[Academy Award|Oscars Ceremony]] in 1929. With his marriage to [[Mary Pickford]] in 1920, the couple became Hollywood royalty and Fairbanks was referred to as "The King of Hollywood",<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://douglasfairbanks.org/bio.htm|website=The Douglas Fairbanks Museum|title=Douglas Fairbanks Sr. Biography|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080515220159/http://douglasfairbanks.org/bio.htm|archivedate=May 15, 2008}}</ref> a nickname later passed on to actor [[Clark Gable]]. His career rapidly declined however with the advent of the "[[sound film|talkies]]". His final film was ''[[The Private Life of Don Juan]]'' (1934).

==Early life==
Fairbanks was born '''Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman''' (spelled "Ulman" by [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] in his memoirs) in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], the son of H. Charles Ullman (born September 15, 1833) and Ella Adelaide (née Marsh; born 1847). He had a half-brother, John Fairbanks, Jr. (born 1873), and a full brother, Robert Payne Ullman (March 13, 1882 – February 22, 1948).

Douglas Fairbanks's father, Hezekiah Charles Ullman (1833–1915) was born in [[Berrysburg, Pennsylvania]], but raised in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]. He was the fourth child in a relatively well-to-do [[Jews|Jewish]] family consisting of six sons and four daughters. Charles's parents, Lazarus Ullman and Lydia Abrahams, had immigrated to the U.S. in 1830 from [[Baden]], Germany. When he was 17, Charles started a small publishing business in Philadelphia. Two years later, he left for New York to study law. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1856 and began building a substantial practice. At the onset of the Civil War, Charles joined the Union forces. He engaged in several battles, was wounded, and later became a captain of the 5th Pennsylvania Reserves. Charles left the service in 1864 and returned to his law practice. He subsequently founded the U.S. Law Association, a forerunner of the [[American Bar Association]].

Charles met Ella Adelaide Marsh (1847–1915), after she married his friend and client John Fairbanks, a wealthy New Orleans sugar mill and plantation owner. The Fairbanks' had a son, John, and shortly thereafter John Senior died of tuberculosis. Ella, born into a wealthy southern Catholic family, was overprotected and knew little of her husband's business. Consequently, she was swindled out of her fortune by her husband's partners. Even the efforts of Charles Ullman, acting on her behalf, failed to regain any of the family fortune for her. Distraught and lonely, she met and married a courtly Georgian, Edward Wilcox, who turned out to be an alcoholic. After they had a son, Norris, she divorced Wilcox with Charles acting as [[pro se|her own lawyer]] in the suit. The pretty southern belle soon became romantically involved with Charles and agreed to move to Denver with him to pursue mining investments. They arrived in Denver in 1881 with her son, John. (Norris was left in Georgia with relatives and was never sent for by his mother.) They were married and in 1882 had a child, Robert and then a second son, Douglas, a year later. Charles purchased several mining interests in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and he re-established his law practice. Charles Ullman abandoned the family when Douglas was five years old and he and his older brother Robert were brought up by their mother, who gave them the family name Fairbanks, after her first husband.

==Career==

===Early career===
Douglas Fairbanks began acting at an early age, in amateur theatre on the Denver stage, performing in [[summer stock]] at the Elitch Gardens Theatre, and becoming a sensation in his teens. He attended [[Denver East High School]], and was once expelled for dressing up the campus statues on St. Patrick's Day. He left during his senior year. He stated that he attended [[Colorado School of Mines]] for a term but no record of attendance has been found. An article on the matter recounts a professor once saying that Fairbanks was asked to leave because of a prank not long after he began. It is also claimed he attended [[Harvard University]].

Fairbanks moved to New York in the early 1900s to pursue an acting career, joining the acting troupe of British actor [[Frederick Warde]] who had discovered Fairbanks performing in Denver. He worked in a hardware store and as a clerk in a Wall Street office before his Broadway debut in 1902.<ref>[http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/atho/atho.detail.people.aspx?personcode=per0017118 Douglas Fairbanks; ''North American Theatre Online'']</ref>

On July 11, 1907, Fairbanks married Anna Beth Sully, the daughter of wealthy industrialist Daniel J. Sully, in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. They had one son, [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.|Douglas Elton Fairbanks]], who later became known as actor "Douglas Fairbanks Jr." In 1915, the family moved to Los Angeles.

Lawyers Albert Banzhaf (left) and Dennis F. O'Brien (right) stand in the background.]]

After moving to Los Angeles, Fairbanks signed a contract with [[Triangle Film Corporation|Triangle Pictures]] in 1915 and began working under the supervision of [[D. W. Griffith|D.W. Griffith]]. His first film was titled ''The Lamb'', in which he debuted the athletic abilities that would gain him wide attention among theatre audiences.<ref name="fairb">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_fairbanks.html |title=American Experience &#124; Mary Pickford &#124; People & Events |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref> His athleticism was not appreciated by Griffith, however, and he was brought to the attention of [[Anita Loos]] and [[John Emerson (filmmaker)|John Emerson]], who wrote and directed many of his early romantic comedies. In 1916, Fairbanks established his own company, the Douglas Fairbanks Film Corporation,<ref name="FAOP">{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeralley.com/fat_fairbanks_01.html |title=Douglas Fairbanks |publisher=Flicker Alley |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref> and would soon get a job at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].<ref name="FAOP" />

[[File:Douglas Fairbanks at third Liberty Loan rally HD-SN-99-02174.JPEG|thumb|right|Fairbanks speaking in front of a crowd at a 1918 war bond drive in New York City.]]

Fairbanks met actress [[Mary Pickford]] at a party in 1916, the couple beginning an affair. In 1917, they joined Fairbanks's friend [[Charlie Chaplin]]<ref name="fairb" /> selling [[war bond]]s by train across the U.S. Pickford and Chaplin were then the two highest paid film stars in Hollywood. To curtail these stars' astronomical salaries, the large studios attempted to monopolize distributors and exhibitors. By 1918, Fairbanks was Hollywood's most popular actor,<ref>{{cite news
|author=Richard Corliss|title=The King of Hollywood |date=June 17, 1996|work=Time Magazine
|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984717,00.html|accessdate=August 10, 2008}}</ref> and within three years of his arrival Fairbanks's popularity and business acumen raised him to the third-highest paid. In 1917, Fairbanks capitalized on his rising popularity by publishing a self-help book, ''Laugh and Live'' which extolled the power of positive thinking and self-confidence in raising one's health, business and social prospects.<ref>Douglas Fairbanks, Laugh and Live. New York, Britton, 1917. The work includes an afterward by journalist George Creel profiling Fairbanks as the epitome of American can-do manhood.</ref>

To avoid being controlled by the studios and to protect their independence, Fairbanks, Pickford, Chaplin, and [[D. W. Griffith]] formed [[United Artists]] in 1919, which created their own distributorships and gave them complete artistic control over their films and the profits generated. The company was kept solvent in the years immediately after its formation largely by the success of Fairbanks's films.

[[File:FairbanksMarkofZorro.jpg|left|thumb|''The Mark of [[Zorro]]''.]]

In late 1918, Sully was granted a divorce from Fairbanks, the judgment being finalized in early 1919. After the divorce, Fairbanks was determined to have Pickford become his wife, but she was still married to actor [[Owen Moore]]. He finally gave her an ultimatum. She then obtained a fast divorce in the small [[Nevada]] town of [[Minden, Nevada|Minden]] on March 2, 1920. Fairbanks leased the [[Beverly Hills]] mansion Grayhall and was rumored to have used it during his courtship of Pickford. The couple married on March 28, 1920. Pickford's divorce from Moore was contested by Nevada legislators, however, and the dispute was not settled until 1922. Even though the lawmakers objected to the marriage, the public went wild over the idea of "Everybody's Hero" marrying "America's Sweetheart." They were greeted by large crowds in London and Paris during their European honeymoon, becoming Hollywood's first celebrity couple. During the years they were married, Fairbanks and Pickford were regarded as "Hollywood Royalty," famous for entertaining at their Beverly Hills estate, [[Pickfair]].

[[File:Fairbanks Robin Hood standing by wall w sword.jpg|right|thumb|Douglas Fairbanks in [[Robin Hood|the title role]] in ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1922).]]

By 1920, Fairbanks had completed twenty-nine films (twenty-eight features and one two-reel short), which showcased his ebullient screen persona and athletic ability. By 1920, he had the inspiration of staging a new type of adventure-costume picture, a genre that was then out of favor with the public; Fairbanks had been a comic in his previous films.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', Fairbanks combined his appealing screen persona with the new adventurous costume element. It was a smash success and parlayed the actor into the rank of [[superstar]]. For the remainder of his career in silent films he continued to produce and star in ever more elaborate, impressive costume films, such as ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1921), ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood]]'' (1922), ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924), ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' (1926, the first full-length [[Technicolor]] film), and ''[[The Gaucho]]'' (1927). Fairbanks spared no expense and effort in these films, which established the standard for all future [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] films.

In 1921, he, Pickford, Chaplin, and others, helped to organize the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Fund]] to assist those in the industry who could not work, or were unable to meet their bills.

During the first ceremony of its type, on April 30, 1927, Fairbanks and Pickford placed their hand and foot prints in wet cement at the newly opened [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood. Fairbanks was elected first President of the [[Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that same year, and he presented the first [[Academy Awards]] at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]]. Today, Fairbanks also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7020 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

===Career decline and retirement===
While Fairbanks had flourished in the silent genre, the restrictions of early sound films dulled his enthusiasm for film-making. His athletic abilities and general health also began to decline at this time, in part due to his years of chain-smoking.<ref>Vance, Jeffrey (2008). Douglas Fairbanks. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, pp. 162–163.</ref> On March 29, 1929, at Pickford's bungalow, [[United Artists]] brought together Pickford, Fairbanks, [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[John Barrymore]], [[D.W. Griffith]] and [[Dolores del Rio]] to speak on the radio show ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'' to prove Fairbanks could meet the challenge of talking movies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramon|first=David|title=Dolores del Río|publisher=Clío|year=1997|pages= |isbn=968-6932-35-6}}</ref>

Fairbanks's last silent film was the lavish ''[[The Iron Mask]]'' (1929), a sequel to 1921's ''The Three Musketeers.'' ''The Iron Mask'' included an introductory prologue spoken by Fairbanks. He and Pickford chose to make their first [[Sound film|talkie]] as a joint venture, playing [[Petruchio]] and [[Katerina Minola|Kate]] in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1929). This film, and his subsequent sound films, were poorly received by Depression-era audiences. The last film in which he acted was the British production ''[[The Private Life of Don Juan]]'' (1934), after which he retired from acting.

Fairbanks and Pickford separated in 1933, after he began an affair with [[Sylvia Ashley|Sylvia, Lady Ashley]]. They divorced in 1936, with Pickford keeping the Pickfair estate. Within months Fairbanks and Ashley were married in Paris.

He continued to be marginally involved in the film industry and [[United Artists]], but his later years lacked the intense focus of his film years. His health continued to decline, and in his final years he lived at 705 Ocean Front (now [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]]) in Santa Monica, California, although much of his time was spent traveling abroad with third wife, Sylvia, Lady Ashley.

==Death==
On December 12, 1939, Fairbanks had a mild [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He died later that day at his home in Santa Monica.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=l1tfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wloNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1352,3146087&dq=douglas+fairbanks+death&hl=en|title=Doug Fairbanks Dies At His Home|date=December 12, 1939|work=Lawrence Journal-World|page=10|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref> Fairbanks's famous last words were, "I've never felt better."<ref>Robinson, R. (2003). ''Famous Last Words''. New York: Workman Publishing, p. 1.</ref> His funeral service was held at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather Church in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] where he was placed in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum.

[[File:Fairbanksgrave.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Fairbanks's tomb at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]].]]

Two years following his death, he was removed from Forest Lawn by his widow, who commissioned an elaborate marble monument for him featuring a long rectangular reflecting pool, raised tomb, and classic Greek architecture in [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. The monument was dedicated in a ceremony held in October 1941, with Fairbanks's close friend [[Charles Chaplin]] reading a remembrance. The remains of his son, [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], were also interred there upon his death in 2000.

==Legacy==
[[File:The Mystery of the Leaping Fish.jpg|left|thumb|Reissue poster for 1916 cocaine comedy ''[[The Mystery of the Leaping Fish]]''.]] 
In 1998, a group of Fairbanks fans started the Douglas Fairbanks Museum in Austin, Texas. The museum building was temporarily closed for mold remediation and repairs in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.drymeout.com/tag/douglas-fairbanks-museum/ |title=Drymeout.com blog |publisher=Blog.drymeout.com |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}</ref> Plans and fundraising efforts are underway to re-open the museum to the public.

In 2002, [[AMPAS]] opened the "Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study" located at 333 S. La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills. The building houses the Margaret Herrick Library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy/buildings/fairbanks.html |title=Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref>

On November 6, 2008, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences celebrated the publication of their "Academy Imprints" book Douglas Fairbanks, authored by film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]], with the screening of a new restoration print of The Gaucho with Vance introducing the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/actors/douglas-fairbanks-the-gaucho-screening/|title=Douglas Fairbanks in THE GAUCHO Academy Screening|author=Andre Soares|work=Alt Film Guide}}</ref>

The following year, opening January 24, 2009, AMPAS mounted a major Douglas Fairbanks exhibition at their Fourth Floor Gallery titled, "Douglas Fairbanks: The First King of Hollywood." The exhibit featured costumes, props, pictures, and documents from his career and personal life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/events-exhibitions/exhibitions/2009/kingofhollywood.html |title=Douglas Fairbanks: The First King of Hollywood &#124; Exhibitions Presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date=April 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> In addition to the exhibit, AMPAS screened ''The Thief of Bagdad'' and ''The Iron Mask'' in March 2009. Concurrently with the Academy's efforts, the Museum of Modern of Art held their first Fairbanks film retrospective in over six decades, titled "Laugh and Live: The Films of Douglas Fairbanks" which ran from December 17, 2008 – January 12, 2009. Jeffrey Vance opened the retrospective with a lecture and screening of the restoration print of The Gaucho.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/649|title=MoMA|work=moma.org}}</ref> Recently, due to his involvement with the [[USC Fencing Club]], a bronze statue of Fairbanks was erected in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Courtyard of the new [[School of Cinematic Arts]] building on the University of Southern California campus. Fairbanks was a key figure in the film school's founding in 1929, and in its curriculum development.

The 2011 film ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' was loosely based on Fairbanks, with the film's lead portraying [[Zorro]] in a silent movie featuring a scene from the Fairbanks version. While thanking the audience in 2012 for a [[Golden Globe]] award as Best Actor for his performance in the film, actor [[Jean Dujardin]] added, "As Douglas Fairbanks would say," then moved his lips silently as a comedic homage. When Dujardin accepted the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|2011 Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], Fairbanks was cited at length as the main inspiration for Dujardin's performance in ''The Artist.''

An important accolade given to the Douglas Fairbanks legacy was a special screening of his masterpiece, ''The Thief of Bagdad'', at the 2012 edition of the Turner Classic Movies Film Festival. On April 15, 2012, the festival concluded with a sold-out screening of the Fairbanks film held at the historic Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The evening was introduced by TCM host Ben Mankiewicz and Fairbanks biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/04/2012-oscars-buoy-the-tcm-classic-film-festival.html|title='The Artist' is the buzz at the TCM Classic Film Festival|work=latimes.com}}</ref>
