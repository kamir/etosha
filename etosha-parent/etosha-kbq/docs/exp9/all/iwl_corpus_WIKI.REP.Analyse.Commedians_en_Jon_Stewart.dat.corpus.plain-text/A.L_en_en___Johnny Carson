'''John William''' "'''Johnny'''" '''Carson''' (October 23, 1925&nbsp;– January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, writer, producer, actor, and musician known for thirty years as host of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1962–1992). Carson received six [[Emmy Award]]s, the Governor's Award, and a 1985 [[Peabody Award]]. He was inducted into the ''[[Television Academy Hall of Fame]]'' in 1987. Johnny Carson was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1992 and received a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]] in 1993.<ref name="EB">Johnny Carson. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/905828/Johnny-Carson Encyclopædia Britannica Online]. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved July 30, 2009.</ref>

Although his show was already successful by the end of the 1960s, during the 1970s Carson became an American icon and remained so until his retirement in 1992. He adopted a casual, conversational approach with extensive interaction with guests, an approach pioneered by [[Arthur Godfrey]] and previous ''Tonight Show'' hosts [[Steve Allen]] and [[Jack Paar]]. Late-night host [[David Letterman]] has cited Carson's influence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956906,00.html | work=Time | title=Interview :David Letterman He's No Johnny Carson | date=February 6, 1989}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Carson was born in [[Corning, Iowa|Corning]], Iowa, on October 23, 1925, to Homer Lloyd "Kit" Carson, a power company manager, and Ruth (Hook) Carson, who was of part Irish descent.<ref name=tynan19780220/> He grew up in the nearby towns of [[Avoca, Iowa|Avoca]], [[Clarinda, Iowa|Clarinda]], and [[Red Oak, Iowa|Red Oak]] in southwest Iowa before moving to [[Norfolk, Nebraska|Norfolk]], Nebraska, at the age of eight. It was there that Carson grew up and began developing his talent for entertaining. At the age of twelve, Carson found a book on magic at a friend's house and immediately purchased a mail-order magician's kit. After the purchase of the kit, Johnny Carson practiced his entertainment skills on family members with card tricks. He was known for following his family members around saying, "Pick a card any card."<ref name="Johnny Carson">{{cite web|last1=Baughman|first1=Judith|title=Johnny Carson|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3468302157&v=2.1&u=mech12755&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=de447effdf175c377fdecf3b257456dd|website=Gale Research Group|publisher=American Decades|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> Carson's mother sewed him a cape, and his first performance was staged right in front of the local Kiwanis Club.

[[File:U.S. Navy portrait of Johnny Carson.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Navy portrait of Carson{{r|tynan19780220}}]]Carson joined the Naval Air Corps on June 8, 1943, received [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] officer training at [[Columbia University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/Careers/Content1?file=trans_johnny_carson.htm&area=Content |title=Careers Johnny Carson |publisher=Military.com |accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref> and [[Millsaps College]].<ref name="millsaps">{{cite web | url=http://www.millsaps.edu/about_millsaps/timeline.php | title=Timeline | publisher=Millsaps College | accessdate=September 10, 2011}}</ref> Commissioned an ensign late in the war, Carson was assigned to the {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|6}} in the Pacific.

Carson served as a communications officer in charge of decoding encrypted messages. He said that the high point of his military career was performing a magic trick for [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[James V. Forrestal]]. In a conversation with James Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy asked Carson if he planned to stay in the navy after the war.<ref name="Carson: Biography"/> In response, Carson said no and told him he wanted to be a magician. Forrestal asked him to perform, and Carson responded with a card trick.<ref name="Carson: Biography"/> Carson made the discovery that he could entertain and amuse someone as cranky and sophisticated as Forrestal.<ref name="Carson: Biography"/>

To take advantage of the educational opportunities from the navy, Carson attended the [[University of Nebraska]] in Lincoln, where he joined The Fraternity of [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and continued performing magic (now paid $25 per appearance{{r|tynan19780220}}). He majored in journalism with the intent of becoming a comedy writer, but switched his major to speech and drama a few months later because he wanted to become a radio performer.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|last1=Bushkin|first1=Henry|title=Johnny Carson|date=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref> Carson's college thesis titled "How to Write Comedian Jokes" was a compilation of taped skits and jokes from popular radio shows with Carson explaining the comedic technique in a voice-over.

He began his broadcasting career in 1950 at [[KXSP|WOW]] radio and television in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska.<ref>[http://www.johnnycarson.com/carson/bio_johnny.jsp The Official Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]</ref> Carson soon hosted a morning television program called ''The Squirrel's Nest''. One of his routines involved interviewing pigeons on the roof of the local courthouse that would allegedly report on the political corruption they had seen. Carson supplemented his income by serving as master of ceremonies at local church dinners, attended by some of the same politicians and civic leaders that he had lampooned on the radio.
[[File:Jack Benny Johnny Carson Benny Show 1955.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Carson as a guest on Jack Benny's television program, 1955.]]
[[File:Johnny carson 1957.JPG|right|thumb|150px|left|Carson in 1957.]]

In 1951 Carson visited California and successfully sought work. The wife of one of the Omaha political figures he spoofed owned stock in a radio station in Los Angeles and referred Carson to her brother, who was influential in the emerging television market in southern California. Later that year Carson went to work at [[CBS]]-owned Los Angeles television station [[KCBS-TV|KNXT]].{{r|tynan19780220}} He would later joke that he owed his success to the birds of Omaha. In 1953 comic [[Red Skelton]]—a fan of Carson's "cult success" low-budget sketch comedy show, ''Carson's Cellar'' (1951 to 1953) on KNXT—asked Carson to join his show as a writer. In 1954 Skelton during rehearsal accidentally knocked himself unconscious an hour before his live show began, and Carson successfully filled in for him.{{r|tynan19780220}} In 1955, [[Jack Benny]] invited Carson to appear on one of his programs during the opening and closing segments. Carson imitated Benny and claimed that Benny had copied his gestures. Benny, however, predicted that Carson would have a successful career as a comedian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUd1-_91YTk |title=Jack Gives Johnny Carson Advice (1955) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

Carson hosted several shows besides ''Carson's Cellar'', including the game show ''Earn Your Vacation'' (1954) and the CBS variety show ''[[The Johnny Carson Show]]'' (1955–1956).{{r|tynan19780220}}<ref>{{IMDb title|0047746|The Johnny Carson Show}}</ref> He was a guest panelist on the original ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' starting in 1960, later becoming a regular panelist from 1961 until 1962. After the prime time ''The Johnny Carson Show'' failed, he moved to New York City to host ''[[Who Do You Trust?]]'' (1957–1962), formerly known as ''[[Do You Trust Your Wife?]]''. In 1958 he appeared as a guest star in an episode entitled "Do You Trust Your Wife" on [[NBC]]'s short-lived variety show, ''[[The Polly Bergen Show]]''. It was on ''Who Do You Trust?'' that Carson met his future [[sidekick]] and [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]], [[Ed McMahon]]. Although he believed moving to [[daytime television|daytime]] would hurt his career, ''Who Do You Trust?'' was a success. It was the first show where he could [[ad lib]] and interview guests,{{r|pioneersoftv}} and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became "the hottest item on daytime television" during his five years at ABC.{{r|tynan19780220}}

==''The Tonight Show''==
{{main|The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson}}
[[File:Dick Cavett Alan King Johnny Carson Friars Club Carson roast 1968.JPG|thumb|right|With [[Dick Cavett]] and [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]] in 1968]]
NBC's ''Tonight'' was the late-night counterpart to its early-morning show ''Today''. Originating in 1953 with host [[Steve Allen]], ''Tonight'' was somewhat experimental at the time, as the only previous network late-night program was NBC's ''[[Broadway Open House]]'' which starred [[Jerry Lester]] and [[Dagmar (American actress)|Dagmar]]. ''Tonight'' was successful, and when Allen moved on to prime-time comedy-variety shows in 1956, [[Jack Paar]] replaced him as host of ''Tonight''. Paar left the show in 1962.

Johnny Carson's success on ABC's ''Who Do You Trust?'' led NBC to invite him to take over ''Tonight'' a few months before Paar's departure. Carson declined the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 1 3/4 hours (105 minutes) daily. [[Bob Newhart]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Groucho Marx]], and [[Joey Bishop]] all declined as well, but NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. Carson can be seen discussing his upcoming job for the first time on the February 11, 1962 episode of ''[[What's My Line?]]''.<ref>{{cite av media|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VK4jCnt3Nw&t=19m50s|title=What's My Line? - Toots Shor; Johnny Carson; Tony Randall & Martin Gabel [panel] (Feb 11, 1962)|date=September 1, 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref> Because Carson had six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over, including [[Merv Griffin]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Joey Bishop]], [[Arlene Francis]] [the first woman to host ''The Tonight Show''], [[Bob Cummings]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Donald O'Conner]], and others.    .{{r|pioneersoftv}}{{r|tynan19780220}}

Although he continued to have doubts about his new job, Carson became host of ''Tonight'' (later becoming ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'') on October 1, 1962, and, after a difficult first year, overcame his fears.{{r|pioneersoftv}} While ''Tonight'' under its previous hosts had been successful, especially under Paar, Carson's version eventually did very well in the ratings. [[Billy Wilder]] said of Carson:

{{quote|By the simple law of survival, Carson is the best. He enchants the invalids and the insomniacs as well as the people who have to get up at dawn. He is the [[Valium]] and the [[Nembutal]] of a nation. No matter what kind of dead-asses are on the show, he has to make them funny and exciting. He has to be their nurse and their surgeon. He has no conceit. He does his work and he comes prepared. If he's talking to an author, he has read the book. Even his rehearsed routines sound improvised. He's the cream of middle-class elegance, yet he's not a mannequin. He has captivated the American bourgeoisie without ever offending the highbrows, and he has never said anything that wasn't liberal or progressive. Every night, in front of millions of people, he has to do the ''salto mortale'' [a circus parlance for an aerial somersault performed on the tightrope]. What's more, he does it without a net. No rewrites. No retakes. The jokes must work tonight.{{r|tynan19780220}}}}

McMahon followed Carson from ''Who Do You Trust?'' as his announcer and sidekick and Skitch Henderson was installed as the Maestro of the NBC orchestra. McMahon's famous introduction, "Heeeeere's Johnny!!!" was followed by a brief monologue by Carson. This was often followed by comedy sketches, interviews, and music. Carson's trademark was a phantom golf swing at the end of his monologues, aimed [[stage left]] toward the studio orchestra. (Guest hosts sometimes parodied that gesture. [[Bob Newhart]] rolled an imaginary bowling ball toward the audience.) Johnny enjoyed what he called the "Carson Kits," or beautiful girls, to adorn his show. Theona Bryant, a favorite, was a model. The other "Carson Cuties" were Phyllis Applegate, Norma Brooks, and Sally Todd.

[[Paul Anka]] wrote the theme song, ("Johnny's Theme"), a reworking of his "Toot Sweet"; given lyrics, it was renamed, "It's Really Love," and recorded by [[Annette Funicello]] in 1959. Before taking over ''The Tonight Show'', Carson wrote lyrics for the song and thus claimed 50% of the song's performance royalties (even though the lyrics were never used). The theme is heard being played on sound recordings of Carson's first ''Tonight Show'' and it was used without interruption through to his very last broadcast on May 22, 1992.

The show was originally produced in New York City, with occasional stints in California. It was not live in its early years, although during the 1970s, NBC fed the live taping from Burbank to New York via satellite for editing (see [[#Carson uncensored on satellite|below]]). The program had been done "live on tape" (uninterrupted unless a problem occurred) since the [[Jack Paar]] days. Carson had a talent for quick quips to deal with problems.{{r|tynan19780220}} If the opening monologue fared poorly, the band would start playing "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]" and Carson danced, to laughs from the studio audience. Alternatively, Carson might pull the [[Boom operator (media)|boom mic]] close to his face and announce ''"Attention [[K-Mart]] shoppers!"''

===Move to Burbank===
On May 1, 1972 the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York to [[Burbank, California]] because of the studio's proximity to the stars. Carson often joked about "beautiful downtown Burbank"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/11/business/fi-nbc11 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=NBC socks it to Burbank | first1=Meg | last1=James | first2=Matea | last2=Gold | date=October 11, 2007 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> and referred to "beautiful downtown [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]," which prompted Bakersfield Mayor [[Mary K. Shell]] to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19810417&id=aGkzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rDIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=3823,5529534|title= Bakersfield invites Johnny Carson to 'see for yourself'|author= UPI|publisher= [[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |date = April 17, 1981 }}</ref>

After July 1971, Carson stopped hosting shows five days a week. Instead, on Monday nights there was a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four each week. Shows were taped in Burbank at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. (8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time) to be shown that evening at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time. On September 8, 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes; [[Tom Snyder]]'s ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]]'' added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. [[Joan Rivers]] became the [[permanent guest host|"permanent" guest host]] from September 1983 until 1986. ''The Tonight Show'' returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic [[George Carlin]]. [[Jay Leno]] then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for ''The Best of Carson''—rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier but occasionally from the 1970s.

Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, ''Tonight'' remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about $4 million a year (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1978|r=-3}}}} today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' and [[Gene Wilder]]'s role in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''.{{r|tynan19780220}} He also declined director [[Martin Scorsese]]'s offer to co-star with [[Robert DeNiro]] in the 1983 film ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]'', the role of a TV talk-show host then going to [[Jerry Lewis]].

In recognition of his 25th anniversary on ''The Tonight Show'', Carson received a personal [[List of Peabody Award winners (1980-1989)#1985|Peabody Award]], the Board saying he had "become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American"; they also said they "felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America."<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/details.php?id=307 | title= Johnny Carson Personal Award | year= 1985 | publisher= [[Henry W.

===Comic characters===
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Carnac.jpg|thumb|Carson as the character "Carnac the Magnificent", mid-1970s.]] -->
Carson played several continuing characters on sketches during the show, including
* '''Art Fern''', the "Tea Time Movie" announcer,<ref name=EW>{{cite web|last=Hibberd |first=James |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/05/14/johnny-carson-pbs-tonight-show-king-of-late-night/ |title='Johnny Carson: King of Late Night' airing tonight: Overrated royalty? A review &#124; Ken Tucker's TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Watching-tv.ew.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref> whose theme song was "[[Hooray for Hollywood]]". Carson once admitted on camera that this was his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: "[[Slim Pickens]], [[Patti Page]], Duke Wayne, and [[Charlton Heston]] in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!" Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of [[Jackie Gleason]]'s "Reginald Van Gleason III" character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress [[Carol Wayne]] became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971–1982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matinée Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body, wincing loudly: "''Ho''&nbsp;— leeeee!" After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air for most of the next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then [[Teresa Ganzel]] to play the Matinée Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at "the fork in the road". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered around the "[[California State Route 90#History|Slauson Cutoff]]", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abrubtly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to "Get out of your car, cut off your slauson, get back in your car," often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.
* '''[[Carnac the Magnificent]]''', a turbaned psychic who could answer questions before seeing them. (This same routine had been done by Carson's predecessor, [[Steve Allen]], as "The Answer Man". The Carnac character and routine also closely resembled [[Ernie Kovacs]]' character "Mr. Question Man".<ref name=EW />) Carnac had a trademark entrance in which he always turned the wrong direction when coming onto stage and then "tripped" on the step up to Carson's desk. (In one episode, technicians rigged Carson's desk to fall apart when Carnac fell into it.) These comedic missteps were an indication of Carnac's true prescient abilities. Ed McMahon would hand Carnac a series of envelopes containing questions, said to have been "hermetically sealed in a mayonnaise jar and left on [[Funk and Wagnall's|Funk & Wagnall]]'s porch since noon today". Carnac would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as "Gatorade". Then he would read the question: "What does an alligator get on welfare?" Some of the jokes were feeble, and McMahon used pauses after terrible puns and audience groans to make light of Carnac's lack of comic success ("Carnac must be used to quiet surroundings"), prompting Carson to return an equal insult. Pat McCormick wrote some of the zaniest Carnac material. The one that had Ed and Carnac nearly rolling on the floor with sustained laughter was "Siss, boom, bah" Answer – "Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes". McMahon would always announce near the end, "I hold in my hand the ''last'' envelope," at which the audience would applaud wildly, prompting Carnac to pronounce a comedic "curse" on the audience, such as "May a flock of wild geese leave a deposit on your breakfast!!" "May your sister elope with a camel!", "May a diseased yak take a liking to your sister", or the most famous: "May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''[[Floyd R. Turbo]], American''' (with no pause between words). A stereotypical common working man, wearing a plaid hunting coat and cap, who offered "editorial responses" to left-leaning causes or news events. Railing against women's rights in the workplace, for example, Turbo would shout: "This raises the question: kiss my Dictaphone!"
* '''Aunt Blabby''', a cantankerous and sometimes amorous old lady, invariably being interviewed by straight man Ed McMahon about elder affairs.<ref name=EW /> McMahon would innocently use a common expression like "check out", only to have Aunt Blabby warn him: "Don't say 'check out' to an old person!" Aunt Blabby was an obvious copy of [[Jonathan Winters]]' most famous creation, Maude Frickert, including her black spinster dress and wig.
* '''El Mouldo''', a mentalist, who would attempt to perform mind-reading and mind-over-matter feats, all of which failed. Often his tricks would include an attempt to bilk money from Ed McMahon or would end with him begging the audience for a dollar, or at least bus fare.
* '''The Maharishi''', whose theme song was "[[Sadko (opera)#Principal arias and numbers|Song of India]]". This frizzy-haired "holy man" spoke in a high-pitched, tranquil tone, greeted announcer McMahon with a flower, and answered philosophical questions.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Carson uncensored on satellite===
Even though Carson's program was based in Burbank beginning in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the program were located in New York, resulting in the requirement that Carson's program be transmitted from Burbank to New York. In 1976, NBC used the [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom]] 2 satellite to do this, feeding the live taping (which usually took place in the early evening) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the normal broadcast. This live feed lasted usually from two to two-and-a-half hours a night, and was uncensored and commercial-free. During the commercial breaks the audio and picture would be left on, capturing at times risque language and other events that would certainly be edited out later going out over the feed.

At the same time, satellite ground stations owned by individuals began appearing, and some found the live feed. Satellite dish owners began to document their sightings in technical journals, giving viewers knowledge of things they were not meant to see. Carson and his production staff grew concerned about this, and pressured NBC into ceasing the satellite transmissions of the live taping in the early 1980s. The satellite link was replaced by microwave transmission until the show's editing facilities were moved to Burbank.<ref>{{cite video|people=Cooper, Jr., Robert B.|title=Television's Pirates: Hiding Behind Your Picture Tube|date=2006}}</ref>

==Effect on popular culture==
Carson's show launched the careers of many performers, especially comedians. For a comedian appearing on the show, getting him to laugh and being invited to the guest chair was considered the highest honor.{{r|tynan19780220}} Most notable among these were [[David Letterman]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Brenner]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Drew Carey]], and [[Roseanne Barr]]. Carson was successor to ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' as a showcase for all kinds of talent, as well as continuing a [[vaudeville]]-style variety show.

In 1966, Carson popularized [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley's]] game [[Twister (game)|Twister]] when he played it with actress [[Eva Gabor]]. Not widely known at the time, the game skyrocketed in popularity after the broadcast.<ref>"Menace to Morals: Twister." ''Minnesota Monthly'', January 2011, 70.</ref>

===Controversies and feuds===
Carson often made jokes at the expense of other celebrities. In 1980, Carson backed out of a deal to acquire the [[Aladdin Hotel & Casino]] in Las Vegas, and a competing group led by [[Wayne Newton]] successfully bought the property. According to lawyer Henry Bushkin, Carson became annoyed that he was often portrayed as having "lost" the deal and started telling "lame [and] stupid" jokes about Newton on his show. This created somewhat of a high-profile feud between Carson and Wayne Newton. Newton appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', declaring that "Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me. And I refused to have it."<ref name="justin">{{cite news | work=[[CNN]]| title=Wayne Newton on Larry King Live| url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/29/lkl.01.html| accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> Newton has often told of confronting Carson directly, after which the jokes stopped.<ref>Henry Bushkin.

One veteran NBC actor, [[Raymond Burr]], became riled over Carson's continuing fat jokes and refused to appear on ''The Tonight Show''.<ref>Michael S. Starr, "Hiding in Plain Sight", 184.</ref>

Carson reportedly loathed what appeared to represent disloyalty among friends and was displeased when former ''Tonight Show'' guest hosts [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] and [[Joan Rivers]] got their own talk shows. Rivers' show on the [[Fox Network]] directly competed with Carson during the 1986–1987 season and then ended. On June 24, 2009, following [[Ed McMahon]]'s death, Rivers lauded McMahon on ''Larry King Live'' but said that after she got her own show Carson never spoke to her again.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/23/joan-rivers-johnny-carson_n 219520.html|date=2009-06-23]</ref>

In December 1973, Carson joked on ''Tonight'' about an alleged shortage of [[toilet paper]]. [[Panic buying]] and [[hoarding]] ensued across the United States as consumers emptied stores,<ref name=buchsbaum19861021>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X20tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tooFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3182%2C1867682 | title=On a roll: Unraveling the truth about toilet paper | work=Boston Phoenix | date=October 21, 1986 | accessdate=May 10, 2012 | author=Buchsbaum, Susan | page=6}}</ref> [[Thomas theorem|causing a real shortage]] that lasted for weeks.

Carson successfully sued a manufacturer of portable toilets who wanted to call its product "Here's Johnny".<ref>Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc., 810 F.2d 104, 105 (6th Cir. 1987)</ref>

Carson did a send-up of the "Mr. Rogers" character, where he played an evil Mr. Rogers who wanted children to steal money from their parents so that his show could continue. [[Fred Rogers]] was not impressed with the skit. Carson later apologized to Rogers for making fun of him.

==Business ventures==
Carson was a major investor in the ultimately failed [[DeLorean Motor Company]].

Carson was head of a group of investors who purchased and operated two television stations. The first was [[KVVU-TV]] in [[Henderson, Nevada]], an [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] serving [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], acquired by the Carson group in 1979. Shortly after buying the station, KVVU was rumored to be acquiring an NBC affiliation as then long-time affiliate KORK-TV was in the process of being replaced by [[KSNV-DT|KVBC]], but it never happened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Carson's second station, independent [[KNAT-TV]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] was purchased in 1982. Unlike the Las Vegas operation, KNAT faced stiffer competition for top-quality, syndicated programming. Carson sold both of his stations between 1985 and 1986, with KVVU going to [[Meredith Corporation]] and KNAT being sold to [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]].

Carson's other business ventures included the successful Johnny Carson Apparel, Inc.{{r|tynan19780220}}—his turtlenecks became a fashion trend—and a failed restaurant franchise.<ref>{{cite news | last = Bernstein | first = Adam | title = For Decades, Comic Ruled Late-Night TV | work= [[The Washington Post]] | date = January 24, 2005 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A30475-2005Jan23}}</ref>

==Retirement==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Johnny Carson portrait.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Johnny Carson in the 1990s]]
Carson retired from show business on May 22, 1992, at age 66, when he stepped down as host of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. His farewell was a major media event, often emotional for Carson, his colleagues, and the audiences, and stretched over several nights. In tribute to Carson and his enormous influence, several networks who had late-night variety talk shows "went dark" for the entire hour he did the last show. [[The Tonight Show]] finally won the Emmy for Outstanding Late-night Series after 13 tries later that year, buoyed by the penultimate broadcast whch featured Johnny's final two guests, [[Robin Williams]] and [[Bette Midler]].

[[NBC]] gave the role of host to the show's then-current permanent guest host, [[Jay Leno]]. Leno and [[David Letterman]] were soon competing on separate networks.

===Post-retirement appearances===
[[File:JohnnyCarson1994.jpg|thumb|right|Johnny Carson, on a trip to Tanzania in 1994.]]
At the end of his final ''Tonight Show'' appearance, Carson indicated that he might, if so inspired, return with a new project. Instead he chose to go into full retirement, rarely giving interviews and declining to participate in NBC's 75th anniversary celebrations. He made an occasional cameo appearance, including voicing himself on the May 13, 1993 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]"), telephoning David Letterman on a November 1993 episode of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and appearing in the 1993 NBC Special ''[[Bob Hope]]: The First 90 Years''.

On May 13, 1994, Carson appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. During a week of shows from Los Angeles, Letterman was having Larry "Bud" Melman ([[Calvert DeForest]]) deliver his "Top Ten Lists" under the guise that a famous personality would be delivering the list instead. On the last show of the week, Letterman indicated that Carson would be delivering the list. Instead, DeForest delivered the list, insulted the audience (in keeping with the gag), and walked off to polite applause. Letterman then indicated that the card he was given did not have the proper list on it and asked that the "real" list be brought out. On that cue, the real Carson emerged from behind the curtain (as Letterman's band played "Johnny's Theme"), an appearance that prompted a standing ovation from the audience. Carson then requested to sit behind Letterman's desk; Letterman obliged, as the audience continued to cheer and applaud. After some moments, Carson departed from the show without having spoken to the audience. He later cited acute [[laryngitis]] as the reason for his silence. This turned out to be Carson's last television appearance.

===Letterman===
Just days before Carson's death, ''The New York Times'' published a story revealing that he occasionally sent jokes to Letterman.<ref>{{cite news | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Carson Feeds Letterman Lines | url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20%2C+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES | accessdate= 2008-05-11}}</ref> Letterman would then use these jokes in the monologue of his show, which Carson got "a big kick out of," according to [[Worldwide Pants]] Inc. Senior Vice-President [[Peter Lassally]], who formerly produced both men's programs. He also claimed that Carson had always believed Letterman, not Leno, to be his "rightful successor."<ref>{{cite news | work=[[The New York Post]] | title=Carson Feeds Letterman Lines | url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20%2C+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES | accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> In his first broadcast after Carson's death, Letterman delivered a monologue compiled entirely of jokes sent in by Carson, a fact the host revealed later in the program.

==Personal life==
Despite his on-camera demeanor, Carson was extremely shy off-camera. He was known for avoiding most large parties, and was referred to as "the most private public man who ever lived".{{r|tynan19780220}}<ref>[[Reader's Digest]] September 2005, p. 178; Book Bonus: Ed McMahon ''Here's Johnny'', Berkley Trade, 2006 ISBN 978-0-425-21229-5</ref> [[Dick Cavett]] recalled, "I felt sorry for Johnny in that he was so socially uncomfortable. I've hardly ever met anybody who had as hard a time as he did."{{r|pioneersoftv}} In addition, [[George Axelrod]] once said of Carson "Socially, he doesn't exist. The reason is that there are no television cameras in living rooms. If human beings had little red lights in the middle of their foreheads, Carson would be the greatest conversationalist on Earth."{{r|tynan19780220}}

He normally refused to discuss politics, social controversies, his childhood, or his private life with interviewers, and offered the following list of pre-written answers to journalists who wanted to ask him questions:<ref name=tynan19780220>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1978/02/20/1978_02_20_047_TNY_CARDS_000326477?printable=true |title=Fifteen Years of the Salto Mortale |author=Tynan, Kenneth | publisher=The New Yorker |date=February 20, 1978|accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref>
#Yes, I did.
#No I didn't 
#Not a bit of truth in that rumor.
#Only twice in my life, both times on Saturday.
#I can do either, but I prefer the first.
#No. [[Kumquat]]s.
#I can't answer that question.
#[[Toad]]s and [[tarantula]]s.
#[[Turkestan]], [[Denmark]], [[Chile]], and the [[Komandorski Islands]].
#As often as possible, but I'm not very good at it yet. I need much more practice.
#It happened to some old friends of mine, and it's a story I'll never forget.{{r|tynan19780220}}

===Politics===
Carson opposed the [[Vietnam War]],<ref name=bio/> and [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], favored [[racial equality]], and was against criminalizing extramarital sex and pornography. He avoided explicitly mentioning his views on ''The Tonight Show'', saying he "hates to be pinned down", as that would "hurt me as an entertainer, which is what I am".{{r|tynan19780220}} As he explained in 1970, "In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, and there are times when I would like to express a view on the air. I would love to have taken on [[Billy Graham]]. But I'm on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it and everything to lose."<ref name=Life>{{cite journal|last=Barthel|first=Joan|title=Here's Johnny!

In his book, Carson's former lawyer Henry Bushkin stated that he "was by instinct and upbringing definitely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but of an [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] sort that we don't see much of anymore.... Overall, you'd have to say he was anti-big: anti-big government, anti-big money, anti-big bullies, anti-big blowhards." Carson served as emcee for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration in 1981 at the request of [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>Henry Bushkin, ''Johnny Carson'', 153–175.</ref>

===Marriages===
In 1948, Carson married Jody Wolcott.{{r|tynan19780220}} The marriage was volatile, with infidelities committed by both parties, and ended in divorce in 1963.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20117582,00.html Pleading Poverty and Demanding Money, Johnny Carson's First Wife Tells the Sad Secrets of Her Troubled Marriage] By Michelle Green, Sue Carswell, Eleanor Hoover May 7, 1990 Vol. 33 No. 18 People Magazine</ref> 

Carson got a "quickie" [[Mexican divorce]] from Wolcott that year and married Joanne Copeland on August 17, 1963. After a second protracted divorce proceeding in 1972, Copeland received a settlement of $6000 per month in [[alimony]] until she remarried or until Johnny's death (she received it until his death in 2005). She also received "a pretty nice little art collection".{{r|tynan19780220}}<ref>''Johnny Carson'' by Henry Bushkin, p. 74<!-- publishing info; ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Joanne Carson (October 20, 1931 – May 8, 2015) died in California, aged 83. She later had a second marriage that also ended in divorce. She had no children.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-joanne-carson-20150509-story.html Death of Joanne Carson], latimes.com; accessed May 10, 2015.</ref>

At the Carson ''Tonight Show''{{'s}} 10th anniversary party on September 30, 1972, Carson announced that he and former model Joanna Holland had been secretly married that afternoon,{{r|tynan19780220}} shocking his friends and associates. Carson kidded that he had married three similarly named women to avoid "having to change the monogram on the towels."{{cn|date=May 2015}}

On March 8, 1983, Holland filed for divorce. Under California's community property laws, she was entitled to 50% of all the assets accumulated during the marriage, even though Carson earned virtually all of the couple's income. During this period, he joked on ''The Tonight Show'', "my producer, [[Frederick de Cordova|Freddie de Cordova]], really gave me something I needed for Christmas. He gave me a gift certificate to the law offices of [[Jacoby & Meyers]]." The divorce case finally ended in 1985 with an eighty-page settlement, Holland receiving $20 million in cash and property.

On June 20, 1987, Carson married Alexis Maas. The marriage lasted until his death in 2005.

===Children===
[[File:Johnny Carson and sons 1955.JPG|thumb|180px|Carson reading a story to his three sons in 1955. From left: Chris, Cory, and Richard (Ricky).]]
Carson had three sons, Christopher, Cory and Richard. All three sons were from his first marriage. Richard Carson died on June 21, 1991, when his car plunged down a steep embankment along a paved service road off Highway 1 near [[Cayucos]], California. Apparently, Richard had been taking photographs when the accident occurred. On the first ''Tonight Show'' after Ricky's death, Carson paid tribute to his son's photographic work, and showed portraits of Ricky accompanied by [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] on blues guitar playing ''Riviera Paradise''. In addition, the final image of the show, as well as some "More to Come" bumpers, of Carson's last show on May 22, 1992, featured a photo Richard had taken.

===Charity===
In 1981, Carson created the John W. Carson Foundation, dedicated to supporting children, education and health services. The foundation continues to support charitable causes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making a World of Difference|date=November 2008|publisher=Children's Hospital Los Angeles|url=http://www.childrenshospitalla.org/atf/cf/%7B1cb444df-77c3-4d94-82fa-e366d7d6ce04%7D/CAMPAIGNNEWS%20FALL%2008.PDF|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>

In November 2004, Carson announced a $5.3 million gift to the University of Nebraska Foundation to support the [[Hixson–Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts]] Department of Theater Arts, which created the Johnny Carson School of Theater and Film. Another $5 million donation was announced by the estate of Carson to the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] following his death.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, while a $1 million donation was announced on November 4, 2011, creating the "Johnny Carson Opportunity Scholarship Fund".<ref>{{cite web|title=Carson Foundation donates $1M for UNL scholarships|date=November 2011|publisher=Lincoln Journal Star|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/education/article_2c55ad55-be37-5123-8f6a-3cfea3655945.html}}</ref>

Carson also donated to causes in his hometown of Norfolk, including the Carson Cancer Center at Faith Regional Health Services, the Elkhorn Valley Museum, and the Johnny Carson Theater at Norfolk Senior High School.  Carson also donated to the Northeast Community College Lifelong Learning Center in honor of his favorite teacher, Miss Faye Gordon.  Miss Gordon had appeared on his show a number of times. His last known visit to Norfolk was to throw the 100th Birthday party for Miss Gordon, which Carson had promised to do several years earlier.

In August 2010, the charitable foundation created by Johnny Carson reported receiving $156 million from a personal trust established by the entertainer years prior to his January 2005 death. Carson's foundation was now by far the largest of the Hollywood charities.<ref>{{cite web|author=Time Waster |url= http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carnac-munificent |title=Carnac The Munificent |publisher=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

===Other notes===
Carson, an amateur [[astronomer]], was a close friend of astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who often appeared on ''The Tonight Show''. The unique way Sagan had of saying certain words, like "billions" of [[galaxy|galaxies]], would lead Carson to ribbing his friend, saying "''BILL-ions and BILL-ions''". Carson was the first person to contact Sagan's wife [[Ann Druyan]] with condolences when the scientist died in 1996. He owned several [[telescope]]s, including a [[Questar Corporation#Products|Questar]], considered at the time a top-of-the-line instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.company7.com/questar|title=Company Seven - Questar Products Index & Overview Page|date=November 2, 2012|work=company7.com}}</ref>

Carson was shown on a 1978 segment of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' practicing at home on a drum set given to him by close friend [[Buddy Rich]], who was the jazz musician with the most appearances on ''The Tonight Show''. [[Gore Vidal]], another frequent ''Tonight Show'' guest and friend, wrote about Carson's personality in his 2006 memoir.<ref>Gore Vidal, Point to Point Navigation: A Memoir, New York: Doubleday, 2006.</ref>

In 1982, Carson was found to be driving his DeLorean while under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded ''[[nolo contendere]]'' to a misdemeanor charge and received a sentence of three years' probation. Carson was required to attend an alcohol program for drivers and was permitted to use his car only to drive to work and back, without transporting any persons or animals in his vehicle.<ref name="wilson19821013">{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NcRTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=54cDAAAAIBAJ&dq=johnny%20carson%20driving%20alcohol%20delorean&pg=5801%2C1144493 | title=Johnny Carson's Driving Restricted | accessdate= 2011-04-06 | last=Wilson | first=Jeff | date=October 13, 1982 | publisher=UPI}}</ref>

Carson was an avid tennis player. When he sold a Malibu house to [[John McEnroe]] and [[Tatum O'Neal]], the escrow terms required McEnroe to give Johnny six tennis lessons.

==Death and tributes==
[[File:Johnny Carson - TV.jpg|200px|thumb|Johnny Carson's Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
On March 19, 1999, Carson suffered a heart attack at his home in [[Malibu, California]] and was hospitalized in nearby [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] where he underwent [[heart bypass|quadruple-bypass surgery]].

Carson was a heavy smoker for decades and, in the early days of his tenure on ''Tonight'', often smoked on-camera. It was reported that as early as the mid-1970s, he would repeatedly say, "These things are killing me." His younger brother recalled that during their last conversation, Carson kept saying, "Those damn cigarettes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20146764,00.html|title=Johnny Carson: 1925-2005|work=people.com}}</ref>

At 6:50 AM [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]] on January 23, 2005, Carson died at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles of respiratory failure arising from [[emphysema]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6504289/ Longtime host of 'Tonight Show' dies at 79] Associated Press, February 8, 2005</ref><ref>[http://news.cnet.com/Net-mourns-death-of-Johnny-Carson/2100-1026_3-5546915.html Net mourns death of Johnny Carson] Jeff Pelline CNET News February 8, 2005</ref> He was 79, and had revealed his terminal illness to the public in September 2002.  His body was cremated and the ashes were given to his wife, Alexis Maas.  In accordance with his family's wishes, no public memorial service was held.  Carson is also survived by his younger brother, Dick who is an [[Emmy Award]] winning director of, among other things, the competing [[Merv Griffin Show]] and [[Wheel of Fortune]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141225/</ref><ref>http://nebraskacoast.com/famous-hollywood-nebraskans/richard-c-dick-carson/</ref>

Numerous tributes were paid to Carson upon his death including a statement by then-President [[George W. Bush]], all recognizing the deep and enduring affection held for him.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/wire/sns-ap-carson-quote-box,0,885790.story Quotations on Johnny Carson's Death] Associated Press January 23, 2005</ref>

At the beginning of this show, Letterman said that for thirty years no matter what was going on in the world, whether people had a good or bad day, they wanted to end it being "tucked in by Johnny." He also told his viewers that the monologue he had just spoken, which was very well received by the studio audience, consisted entirely of jokes sent to him by Carson in the last few months of his life.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/123709/letterman_pays_special_tribute_to_carson/ |title= Letterman Pays Special Tribute to Carson | date= February 1, 2005 | agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Doc Severinsen ended the Letterman show that night by playing, along with [[Tommy Newsom]], one of Carson's two favorite songs, "[[Here's That Rainy Day]]" (the other was "[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]").

On his final ''Tonight Show'' appearance, Carson himself said that while sometimes people who work together for long stretches of time on television don't necessarily like each other, this was not the case with him and McMahon; they were good friends who would have drinks and dinner together, and the camaraderie that they had on the show could not be faked. Carson and McMahon were friends for 46 years.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=OzkV0UxzRRgC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21 |title=Lauderdale: Playground of the Stars |isbn= 0-7385-5351-4 | page=21 | first=Jack| last=Drury | year=2008 | publisher=Arcadia Publishing |accessdate=2011-04-26 |series=Images of America}}</ref>
