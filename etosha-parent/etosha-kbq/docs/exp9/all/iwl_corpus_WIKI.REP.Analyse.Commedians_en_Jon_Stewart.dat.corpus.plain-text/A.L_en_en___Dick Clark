'''Richard Augustus Wagstaff''' "'''Dick'''" '''Clark, Jr.'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/dick-clark/person/2798/summary.html|title=Dick Clark on|publisher=Tv.com|date=2010-07-19|accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref> (November 30, 1929&nbsp;– April 18, 2012) was an American [[radio personality|radio]] and [[television personality]], as well as a cultural icon who remains best known for hosting ''[[American Bandstand]]'' from 1957 to 1987. He also hosted the game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' and ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'', which transmitted [[Times Square]]'s New Year's Eve celebrations. Clark was also well known for his trademark sign-off, "For now, Dick Clark — so long!", accompanied with a military salute.

As host of ''American Bandstand'', Clark introduced [[rock & roll]] to many Americans. The show gave many new music artists their first exposure to national audiences, including [[Ike and Tina Turner]], [[Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Talking Heads]] and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. Episodes he hosted were among the first where blacks and whites performed on the same stage and among the first where the live studio audience sat without racial segregation. Singer [[Paul Anka]] claimed that Bandstand was responsible for creating a "youth culture." Due to his perennial youthful appearance, Clark was often referred to as "America's oldest teenager".<ref name=HOF>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/dick-clark/bio/|title=Dick Clark Biography|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|date= |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

In his capacity as a businessman, Clark served as [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[Dick Clark Productions]], part of which he sold off in his later years. He also founded the American Bandstand Diner, a restaurant chain modeled after the [[Hard Rock Cafe]]. In 1973, he created and produced the annual [[American Music Awards]] show, similar to the [[Grammy Awards]].<ref name=HOF />

Clark suffered a [[stroke]] in December 2004. With speech ability still impaired, Clark returned to his ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' show a year later on December 31, 2005. Subsequently, he appeared at the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2006, and every ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' show through the 2011&ndash;12 show. Clark died on April 18, 2012 of a heart attack at the age of 82 following a medical procedure.<ref name="abcnews1">{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dick-clark-entertainment-icon-nicknamed-americas-oldest-teenager/story?id=16076252|title=Dick Clark, Entertainment Icon Nicknamed 'America's Oldest Teenager,' Dies at 82|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=April 18, 2012|date=April 18, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Clark was born and raised in [[Mount Vernon, New York]],<ref name="nyt obit">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/arts/television/dick-clark-tv-host-and-icon-of-new-years-eve-is-dead-at-82.html?pagewanted=all|title=TV Emperor of Rock 'n' Roll and New Year's Eve Dies at 82|author=Bruce Weber|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 18, 2012|date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> the son of Richard Augustus Clark and Julia Fuller (''[[married and maiden names|née]]'' Barnard) Clark. His only sibling, older brother Bradley, was killed in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] during [[World War II]].

Clark attended A.B. Davis High School (later renamed A.B. Davis Middle School) in Mount Vernon, where he was an average student.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=Dick Clark|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/clark.htm|work=The History of Rock 'n' Roll|author=DK Peneny|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> At age 10, Clark decided to pursue a career in radio.<ref name=history /> In pursuit of that goal, he attended [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], graduating in 1951 with a degree in advertising and a minor in radio.<ref name=history /> While at Syracuse, he was a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Phi Gamma).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_150/157_dick_clark_interview.html|title=Dick Clark|publisher=AskMen.com|accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref>

==Radio and television career==
In 1945, Clark began his career working in the mailroom at [[WUTI|WRUN]], an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio station in [[Rome, New York]], that was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. Almost immediately, he was asked to fill in for the vacationing weatherman, and within a few months he was announcing station breaks.<ref name=history />

While attending Syracuse, Clark worked at [[WOLF (AM)|WOLF-AM]], then a country music station. After graduation, he returned to WRUN for a short time where he went by the name Dick Clay.<ref name=history /> After that, Clark got a job at the television station [[WKTV]] in [[Utica, New York]].<ref name=history /> His first television-hosting job was on ''Cactus Dick and the Santa Fe Riders'', a [[country music|country-music]] program. He would later replace [[Robert Earle]] (who would later host the ''[[College Bowl|GE College Bowl]]'') as a newscaster.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rock, Roll and Remember|first=Dick|last=Clark|first2=Richard|last2=Robinson|location=[[New York City]], [[New York]]|publisher=[[Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|Thomas Y. Crowell Co]]<!--piped to avoid duplicate "period" after "co"-->|year=1976|ISBN=978-0-690-01184-5}}</ref>

Clark was principal in pro broadcasters operator<!-- Eh? --> of 1440 KPRO in [[Riverside, California]], from 1962 to 1982. In the 1960s, he was owner of KGUD AM/FM (later KTYD AM/FM) in [[Santa Barbara, California]].{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

===''American Bandstand''===
{{main|American Bandstand}}
In 1952, Clark moved to [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], where he took a job as a disc jockey at radio station [[WFIL]], adopting the Dick Clark handle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Clark, legendary host of 'American Bandstand,' dies at 82|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2012/04/18/3562924/dick-clark-legendary-host-of-american.html|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|publisher=KansasCity.com|author=Dan Deluca, Sam Wood and Michael D. Schaffer |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref> WFIL had an affiliated television station (now [[WPVI-TV|WPVI]]) with the same [[call sign]], which began broadcasting a show called ''[[Bob Horn (broadcaster)|Bob Horn]]'s Bandstand'' in 1952. Clark was responsible for a similar program on the company's radio station, and served as a regular substitute host when Horn went on vacation.<ref name=history /> In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving and was subsequently dismissed.<ref name=history /> On July 9, 1956, Clark became the show's permanent host.<ref name=history />

''Bandstand'' was picked up by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network, renamed ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and debuted nationally on August 5, 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleynews.com/DickClark.html|title=Dick Clark&nbsp;— Elvis 1961 Interview; American Bandstand Compare: Dick Clark; Dick Clark's Elvis Collection Sold at Auction|publisher=elvispresleynews.com|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref> The show took off, due to Clark's natural rapport with the live teenage audience and dancing participants as well as the non-threatening image he projected to television audiences. As a result, many parents were introduced to rock and roll music. According to Hollywood producer [[Michael Uslan]], "he was able to use his unparalleled communication skills to present [[rock 'n roll]] in a way that was palatable to parents."<ref name=latimes/>

In 1958, ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'' was added to ABC's Saturday night lineup.<ref name=history /> By the end of year, viewership exceeded 20 million, and featured artists were "virtually guaranteed" large sales boosts after appearing.<ref name=history /> In a surprise television tribute to Clark in 1959 on ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', host [[Ralph Edwards]] called him "America’s youngest starmaker," and estimated the show had an audience of 50 million.

Clark moved the show from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in 1964.<ref name=history /> The move was related to the popularity of new "surf" groups based in Southern California, including [[The Beach Boys]] and [[Jan and Dean]]. The show ran daily Monday through Friday until 1963, then weekly on Saturdays until 1987. ''Bandstand'' was briefly revived in 1989, with Clark again serving as host. By the time of its cancellation, the show had become longest-running variety show in TV history.<ref name=history/>

In the 1960s, the show's emphasis changed from merely playing records to including live performers. During this period, many of the leading rock groups of the 1960s had their first exposure to nationwide audiences. A few of the many artists introduced were [[Ike and Tina Turner]], [[Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Fats Domino]] and [[Chubby Checker]].<ref name=encyc/><ref>{{YouTube|id=4E5xy6gjnt4|title=American Bandstand 30 Year Special - 1982 (2/11)}}</ref>

During an interview with Clark by Henry Schipper of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1990, it was noted that "over two-thirds of the people who've been initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] had their television debuts on ''American Bandstand'', and the rest of them probably debuted on other shows [they] produced."<ref name=RollingStone>Schipper, Henry. "Dick Clark", ''Rolling Stone'', April 19, 1990 pp. 67–70, 126</ref> During the show's lifetime, it featured over 10,000 live performances, many by artists who would have been unable to appear anywhere else on TV, as the variety shows during much of this period were "antirock."<ref name=RollingStone/> Schipper points out that Clark's performers were shocking to general audiences:
{{quote|The music establishment, and the adults in general, really hated [[rock and roll]]. Politicians, ministers, older songwriters and musicians foamed at the mouth. [[Frank Sinatra]] reportedly called Elvis Presley a "rancid-smelling aphrodisiac."<ref name=RollingStone/>}}

Clark was therefore considered to have a negative influence on youth, and was well aware of that impression held by most adults:
{{quote|I was roundly criticized for being in and around rock and roll music at its inception. It was the devil's music, it would make your teeth fall out and your hair turn blue, whatever the hell. You get through that.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-legacy-of-dick-clark-the-fastest-follower-in-the-business-20120418 "The Legacy of Dick Clark, 'The Fastest Follower in the Business'"], ''Rolling Stone'', April 18, 2012</ref>}}

In 2002, many of the groups he introduced appeared at the 50th anniversary special to celebrate ''American Bandstand''.<ref>{{YouTube|id=W0pJb68JbE4|title=American Bandstand 50th Anniversary clip 2002}}</ref> Clark noted during the special that ''American Bandstand'' was listed in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as "the longest-running variety show in TV history." In 2010, ''American Bandstand'' and Clark himself were honored at the Daytime Emmy Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Dick-Clark-Emmys-1019031.aspx |title=Dick Clark to be Honored at Daytime Emmys|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2012|author=Natalie Abrams|publisher=TVGuide.com}}</ref> [[Hank Ballard]], who wrote "The Twist," described Clark's popularity during the early years of ''American Bandstand'':
{{quote|The man was big. He was the biggest thing in America at that time. He was bigger than the president!<ref name=usatoday/>}}

As a result of Clark's work on ''Bandstand'', journalist Ann Oldenburg states "he deserves credit for doing something bigger than just putting on a show."<ref name=usatoday>Oldenburg, Ann. [http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-04-18/dick-clark-dies-at-82/54390716/1 "TV legend Dick Clark dies at age 82"], ''[[USA Today]]'', April 18, 2012.</ref> ''Los Angeles Times'' writer, Geoff Boucher, goes further, stating that "with the exception of Elvis Presley, Clark was considered by many to be the person most responsible for the bonfire spread of [[rock 'n roll]] across the country in the late 1950s," making Clark a "household name."<ref name=latimes /> He became a "primary force in legitimizing rock 'n' roll," adds Uslan. Clark, however, simplified his contribution:
{{quote|I played records, the kids danced, and America watched.<ref name=cbsnews>[http://www.cbsnews.com/2102-31749_162-57415954.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody "Dick Clark dead at 82"], CBS News, April 18, 2012</ref>}}

Shortly after taking over, Clark also ended the show's all-white policy by featuring black artists such as [[Chuck Berry]]. In time, blacks and whites performed on the same stage, and studio seating was desegregated.<ref name=encyc>Milner, Andrew (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', Vol. I, St. James Press (2000) pp. 525–527</ref> During the late 1950s and 1960s, Clark produced and hosted a series of concert tours around the success of ''American Bandstand'', which by 1959 had a national audience of 20 million.<ref name=usatoday/> However, Clark was unable to get the [[Beatles]] to appear when they came to America.<ref name=latimes/>

The reason for Clark's impact on popular culture was partly explained by [[Paul Anka]], a singer who appeared on the show early in his career: "This was a time when there was no youth culture — he created it. And the impact of the show on people was enormous."<ref name=nyt>[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-dies-at-82/?emc=na "Reactions to Death of Dick Clark, New Year's Eve Icon"] ''The New York Times'' blog, April 18, 2012</ref> In 1990, a few years after the show had been off the air, Clark considered his personal contribution to the music he helped introduce:
{{quote|My talent is bringing out the best in other talent, organizing people to showcase them and being able to survive the ordeal. I hope someday that somebody will say that in the beginning stages of the birth of the music of the fifties, though I didn't contribute in terms of creativity, I helped keep it alive.<ref name=RollingStone/>}}

===Payola hearings===
In 1960, the [[United States Senate]] investigated [[payola]], the practice of music-producing companies paying broadcasting companies to favor their product. As a result, Clark's personal investments in music publishing and recording companies were considered a conflict of interest, and he sold his shares in those companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jordan Brothers&nbsp;— A Musical Biography of Rock's Fortunate Sons|first=Maxim W.|last=Furek|publisher=Kimberley Press|location=[[Berwick, Pennsylvania|Berwick]], [[Pennsylvania]]|year=1986|oclc=15588651}}</ref>

When asked about some of the causes for the hearings, Clark speculated about some of the contributing factors not mentioned by the press:
{{quote|Politicians . . . did their damnedest to respond to the pressures they were getting from parents and publishing companies and people who were being driven out of business [by rock]. . . . It hit a responsive chord with the electorate, the older people. . . . they full-out ''hated'' the music. [But] it stayed alive. It could've been nipped in the bud, because they could've stopped it from being on television and radio.<ref name=RollingStone/>}}

===Game show host===
{{main|Pyramid (game show)}}
Beginning in late 1963, Clark branched out into hosting game shows, presiding over ''[[The Object Is]]''.<ref name=ObjectIs>{{cite web|title=The Object Is|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-object-is/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> The show was cancelled in 1964, and replaced by ''[[Missing Links (game show)|Missing Links]]'', which had moved from [[NBC]]. Clark took over as host, replacing [[Ed McMahon]].<ref name=ObjectIs />

[[File:Dick Clark $10000 Pyramid.JPG|thumb|upright|Dick Clark as host of ''The $10,000 Pyramid'']]
Clark became the first host of ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'', which premiered on CBS March 26, 1973.<ref name=EW>{{cite news|title=A Dick Clark appreciation: The deceptively laid-back, conservative revolutionary|author=Ken Tucker|date=April 18, 2012|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-american-bandstand-pyramid-rockin-eve/|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> The show — a word-association game created and produced by daytime television producer [[Bob Stewart (television)|Bob Stewart]] — moved to ABC in 1974. Over the coming years, the top prize changed several times (and with it the name of the show), and several primetime spinoffs were created.<ref name=EW /> As the program moved back to CBS in September 1982, Clark continued to host the daytime version through most of its history, winning three [[Emmy Awards]] for best game show host.<ref name=q1520 /> In total, ''Pyramid'' won nine Emmy Awards for best game show during his run, a mark that is eclipsed only by the twelve won by the [[television syndication|syndicated]] version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]''.<ref name=HollywoodReporter>{{cite news|title=Dick Clark Dead of Heart Attack at 82|author=Duane Byrge|date=April 18, 2012|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dick-clark-dead-heart-attack-82-years-old-stroke-313743|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> Clark's final ''Pyramid'' hosting gig, ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', ended in 1988.

Clark subsequently returned to ''Pyramid'' as a guest in later incarnations. During the premiere of the [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] version in 1991, Clark sent a pre-recorded message wishing Davidson well in hosting the show. In 2002, Clark played as a celebrity guest for three days on the [[Donny Osmond]] version. Earlier, he was also a guest during the [[Bill Cullen]] version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' which aired simultaneously with Clark's daytime version of the show.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' credited Clark's "quietly commanding presence" as a major factor in the game show's success.<ref name=EW />

Clark hosted the syndicated television game show ''[[The Challengers (game show)|The Challengers]]'', during its only season (1990–91).  ''The Challengers'' was a co-production between the production companies of Dick Clark and [[Ron Greenberg]].  Also during the 1990-91 season, Clark and Greenberg co-produced a revival of ''[[Let’s Make a Deal]]'' for NBC with [[Bob Hilton]] as the host.  Hilton would later be replaced by original host [[Monty Hall]].  Clark would later host ''[[Scattergories (game show)|Scattergories]]'' on NBC in 1993; and [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|The Family Channel]]'s version of ''[[It Takes Two (game show)|It Takes Two]]'' in 1997. In 1999, along with Bob Boden, he was one of the executive producers of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s TV game show ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', which ran from November 5, 1999, to July 14, 2000, and was hosted by [[Chuck Woolery]]. At the same time, Clark also hosted the Stone-Stanley-created ''[[Winning Lines (U.S. game show)|Winning Lines]]'', which ran for six weeks on CBS from January 8 through February 12, 2000.

===''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve''===
{{main|Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve}}
In 1972, Dick Clark first produced ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'', a [[New Year's Eve]] music special for [[NBC]] which included coverage of the [[Times Square Ball|ball drop festivities]] in [[New York City]]. Clark aimed to challenge the dominance of [[Guy Lombardo]]'s New Year's specials on [[CBS]], as he believed its [[big band]] music skewed too old. After two years on NBC, and being hosted by [[Three Dog Night]] and [[George Carlin]] respectively, the program moved to ABC and Clark assumed hosting duties. Following Lombardo's death in 1977, ''Rockin' Eve'' experienced a surge in popularity, and would go on to become the most watched New Year's Eve broadcast yearly. Clark would also serve as a special correspondent for [[ABC News]]'s ''[[ABC 2000]]'' broadcast, covering the arrival of 2000.<ref name="ppg-Lombardo">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011226guy1226p6.asp|title=Next week to be 25th New Year's Eve without Guy Lombardo|accessdate=2007-01-01|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|first=Frazier|last=Moore|date=December 26, 2001|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name=dc72-usatoday>{{cite news|last=Memmott|first=Carol|title=Dick Clark: Rockin' it on New Year's since 1972|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/story/2011-12-27/dick-clark-rockin-new-years-eve-40th-anniversary/52246914/1|work=USA Today|accessdate=2 March 2012|date=December 27, 2011}}</ref><ref name=ms-newguy>{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Carol Burton|title=New Guy Lombardo?

Reaction to Clark's appearance was mixed. While some TV critics (including Tom Shales of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', in an interview with the [[CBS Radio Network]]) felt that he was not in good enough shape to do the broadcast, stroke survivors and many of Clark's fans praised him for being a role model for people dealing with post-stroke recovery.<ref name=dc72-usatoday/><ref>{{cite news |date=January 4, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/04/dick.clark.ap/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060111104055/http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/04/dick.clark.ap/index.html|archivedate=January 11, 2006|title= Clark Outing Cheers Stroke Survivors |agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher = [[CNN]] | deadurl = yes |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref> Seacrest has remained host and an executive producer of the special ever since.<ref name=usatoday-dcextended>{{cite news|title=Ryan Seacrest extends 'New Year's Rockin' Eve' deal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/10/23/ryan-seacrest-extends-new-years-rockin-eve-deal/3169059/|work=USA Today|accessdate=6 November 2013|first1=Ann|last1=Oldenburg|date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>

===Radio programs===
Clark's first love was radio, and in 1963 he began hosting a radio program called ''The Dick Clark Radio Show''. It was produced by Mars Broadcasting of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]. Despite Clark's enormous popularity on ''American Bandstand'', the show was only picked up by a few dozen stations and lasted less than a year.<ref name=Highlights>{{cite news|title=Beyond 'American Bandstand': Dick Clark's career highlights, from Philly to Hollywood|date=April 18, 2012|agency=Associated Press|work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/beyond-american-bandstand-dick-clarks-career-highlights-from-philly-to-hollywood/2012/04/18/gIQAj7PoRT_story.html|accessdate=April 20, 2012|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

[[File:Dick clark radio show 1963.JPG|thumb|upright|Photo of Clark in 1963. His ABC radio show was called "Dick Clark Reports".]]
On March 25, 1972, Clark hosted ''[[American Top 40]]'', filling in for [[Casey Kasem]].<ref name=CNN>{{cite news|title='Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark'|author=Alan Duke|author2=Chelsea J.

Clark left Mutual in 1986, and Charlie Tuna took over the National Music Survey.<ref name=q1520 /> Clark then launched his own radio syndication group with partners Nick Verbitsky and [[Ed Salamon]] called the United Stations Radio Network. That company later merged with the Transtar Network to become Unistar, and took over the countdown program ''Countdown America''. The program ran until 1994, when Unistar was sold to Westwood One Radio. The following year, Clark and Verbitsky started over with a new version of the USRN, bringing into the fold ''Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember'', written and produced by Pam Miller (who also came up with the line used in the show and later around the world: "the soundtrack of our lives"), and a new countdown show: ''The U.S. Music Survey'', produced by Jim Zoller. Clark served as its host until his 2004 stroke.<ref name=q1520 /> [[United Stations Radio Networks]] continues in operation as of 2013.

Dick Clark's longest running radio show began on February 14, 1982. ''Rock, Roll & Remember'' was a four-hour oldies show named after Clark's 1976 autobiography. The first year, it was hosted by veteran Los Angeles disc jockey Gene Weed. Then in 1983, voiceover talent [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliot]] co-hosted with Clark. By 1985, Clark hosted the entire show. Pam Miller wrote the program and Frank Furino served as producer. Each week, Clark would profile a different artist from the rock and roll era and count down the top four songs that week from a certain year in the 1950s, 1960s or early 1970s. The show ended production when Clark suffered his 2004 stroke. However, reruns from the 1995-2004 era continue to air in syndication and on Clark's website, dickclarkonline.com.<ref name=q1520 />

Beginning in 2009, Clark merged elements of ''Rock, Roll and Remember'' with the syndicated oldies show, ''Rewind with [[Gary Bryan]]''. The new show was called ''Dick Clark Presents Rewind with Gary Bryan''. Bryan, a Los Angeles radio personality, serves as the main host. Clark contributed profile segments.

===Other television programs===
At the peak of his ''American Bandstand'' fame, Clark also hosted a 30-minute Saturday night program called ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'' (aka ''The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show''). It aired from February 15, 1958, until September 10, 1960, on the ABC television network. It was broadcast live from the "Little Theater" in New York City and was sponsored by Beech-Nut gum. It featured the rock and roll stars of the day lip-synching their hits, just as on ''American Bandstand''. However, unlike the afternoon ''Bandstand'' program, which focused on the dance floor with the teenage audience demonstrating the latest dance steps, the audience of ''The Dick Clark Show'' sat in a traditional theater setting. While some of the musical numbers were presented simply, others were major production numbers. The high point of the show was Clark's unveiling, with great fanfare at the end of each program, of the top ten records of the coming week.<ref name="Brooks And Marsh">{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Brooks|first2=Earle|last2=Marsh|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable Shows, 1946&nbsp;– present|edition=8th, revised and updated|year=2003|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|ISBN=978-0-345-45542-0}}</ref>  This ritual became so embedded in American culture that it was imitated in many media and contexts, and to this day is satirized nightly by [[David Letterman]].

From September 27 to December 20, 1959, Clark hosted a 30-minute weekly talent/variety series entitled ''[[Dick Clark's World of Talent]]'' at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. Sundays on ABC. A variation of producer Irving Mansfield's earlier [[CBS]] series, ''This Is Show Business'' (1949–1956), it featured three celebrity panelists, including comedian [[Jack E. Leonard]], judging and offering advice to amateur and semi-professional performers. While this show was not a success during its nearly three month duration, Clark was one of the few personalities in television history on the air nationwide seven days a week.<ref name="Brooks And Marsh"/>

One of Clark's most well-known guest appearances was in the final episode ("The Case of the Final Fade-Out") of the original ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' TV series, in which Clark was revealed to be the killer of an egomaniacal actor during a take of a television show.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0673265/|title=The case of the Final Fade-Out|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Dick Clark, TV and New Year's Eve icon, dies at 82|author=Lynn Elber|date=April 18, 2012|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Google|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixPkPti7yiDpPDsNbeSFOtRrPmKQ?docId=2d14e822d03e4356b98345c82bc0893b|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>  He also appeared as a drag-racing-strip owner in a 1973 episode of the [[procedural drama]] series ''[[Adam-12]]''.

Clark attempted to branch into the realm of [[soul music]] with the series ''Soul Unlimited'' in 1973. The series, hosted by [[Buster Jones]], was a more risqué and controversial imitator of the then-popular series ''[[Soul Train]]'' and alternated in the ''Bandstand'' time slot. The series lasted for only a few episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top 10 Things You Didn't Know About "Soul Train"|date=February 2, 2012|work=NewsOne|url=http://newsone.com/1844265/soul-train-wiki/|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> Despite a feud between Clark and ''Soul Train'' creator and host [[Don Cornelius]], the two would later collaborate on several specials featuring black artists. Clark hosted the short-lived ''[[Dick Clark's LIVE Wednesday]]'' in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Clark's Live Wednesday|work=TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/dick-clarks-live-wednesday/|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

In 1980, Clark served as host of the short-lived series ''[[The Big Show (TV series)|The Big Show]]'', an unsuccessful attempt by NBC to revive the [[variety show]] format of the '50s and '60s.

In 1984, Clark produced and hosted the NBC series ''[[TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes]]'' with co-host with [[Ed McMahon]]. The series ran through 1988 and continued in specials hosted by Clark (sometimes joined by another TV personality) into the 21st century, first on NBC, later on ABC, and currently on TBS (the last version re-edited into 15-minute/filler segments airing at about 5:00&nbsp;a.m.). Clark and McMahon were longtime Philadelphia acquaintances, and McMahon praised Clark for first bringing him together with future TV partner [[Johnny Carson]] when all three worked at ABC in the late 1950s. The "Bloopers" franchise stems from the Clark-hosted (and produced) NBC "Bloopers" specials of the early 1980s, inspired by the books, record albums and appearances of [[Kermit Schafer]], a radio and TV producer who first popularized outtakes of broadcasts.<ref name=AP /> For a period of several years in the 1980s, Clark simultaneously hosted regular programs on the three major American television networks: ABC (''Bandstand''), CBS (''Pyramid'') and NBC (''Bloopers'').

In July 1985, Clark hosted the ABC primetime portion of the historic [[Live Aid]] concert, an all star concert designed by [[Bob Geldof]] to end world hunger.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1204/18/sitroom.02.html |title=Dick Clark Dies of "Massive Heart Attack"; Secret Service Resignations Amidst Scandal |publisher=CNN |date= April 18, 2012 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

Clark also hosted various pageants from 1988 to 1993 on CBS.

Clark did a brief stint as announcer on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' in 1995.<ref>{{YouTube|id=swLeUwcQbBU|title=Pop Will Eat Itself on The Jon Stewart Show}}</ref>

Clark also created and hosted two Fox television specials in 2000 called ''[[Challenge of the Child Geniuses]]''.  This would be the last game show he would host.

From 2001 to 2003, Clark was a co-host of ''[[The Other Half (TV series)|The Other Half]]'' with [[Mario Lopez]], [[Danny Bonaduce]] and [[Dorian Gregory]], a syndicated daytime talk show intended to be the male equivalent of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. Clark also produced the television series ''[[American Dreams]]'' about a Philadelphia family in the early 1960s whose daughter is a regular on ''American Bandstand''. The series ran from 2002 to 2005.<ref name=AP />

===Other media appearances===
Clark was featured in the 2002 documentary film ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]''. He was criticized for hiring poor, unwed mothers to work long hours in his chain of restaurants for little pay. The mother featured is shown to work over 80 hours per week and is still unable to make her rent and then gets evicted which results in her having to have her son stay at his uncle's house. At his uncle's house the boy finds a gun and brings it to school where he shoots another first grader. In the documentary footage, Michael Moore, with cameraman in tow, approached Clark as he was pulling into his work parking space and attempted to question Clark about welfare policies that allow for those conditions. Moore tried to query him about the people he employed and the tax breaks he allegedly took advantage of, in employing welfare recipients; Clark refuses to answer any of Moore's questions, shutting the car door and driving away.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/04/19/dick-clark-a-career-in-milestones/ | title=Dick Clark: A career in milestones | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

Clark also appeared in interview segments of another 2002 film, ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'', which was based on the "unauthorized autobiography" of [[Chuck Barris]]. (Barris had worked at ABC as a standards-and-practices executive during ''American Bandstand''{{'s}} run on that network.)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1683415/dick-clark-movies.jhtml | title=Dick Clark: A Big-Screen Tribute | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

In the 2002 ''[[Dharma and Greg]]'' episode "Mission: Implausible," Greg is the victim of a college prank, and devises an elaborate plan to retaliate, part of which involves his use of a disguise kit; the first disguise chosen is that of Dick Clark. During a fantasy sequence that portrays the unfolding of the plan, the real Clark plays Greg wearing his disguise.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tv.com/shows/dharma-greg/mission-implausible-129704/ | title=Dharma & Greg Mission: Implausible TV.com | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

He also made brief cameos in two episodes of the ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. In one episode he plays himself at a Philadelphia diner, and in the other he helps [[Will Smith]]'s character host [[blooper]]s from past episodes of that sitcom.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-the-philadelphia-story/ | title=The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: The Philadelphia Story:Overview | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

From 1979 to 1980, Clark reportedly owned the former scandal-ridden Westchester Premier Theatre in [[Greenburgh, NY]] and renamed it the Dick Clark Westchester Theatre.<ref name=rivertowndv >{{cite web|last=Kanwar|first=Tanuja|title=Westchester Native Dick Clark Dead at 82|url=http://rivertowns.dailyvoice.com/news/westchester-native-dick-clark-dead-82|publisher=The Rivertowns Daily Voice|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref> A recently opened Stop & Shop supermarket now stands at that location.<ref name=rivertowndv />

==Personal life==
Clark was married three times. His first marriage was to Barbara Mallery in 1952; the couple had one son, Richard Augustus Clark III ("R.A.", or "Rac"), and divorced in 1961. He married Loretta Martin in 1962; the couple had two children, [[Duane Clark|Duane]] and Cindy, and divorced in 1971. His third marriage, to Kari Wigton, whom he married on July 7, 1977, lasted until his death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Sara|title=Dick Clark, Host of American Bandstand, Is Dead at 82|work=The Independent Sentinel|accessdate=April 21, 2012 | date = April 18, 2012 | url = http://www.independentsentinel.com/2012/04/dick-clark-host-of-american-bandstand-is-dead-at-82/}}</ref>

During an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in April 2004, Clark revealed that he had [[Type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/other/press-releases/pr06.htm |title= Dick Clark Goes Public With His Diabetes |publisher=Diabetes Monitor |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

On December 8, 2004, the then 75-year-old was hospitalized in [[Los Angeles]] after suffering what was initially termed a minor [[stroke]]. Although he was expected to be fine, it was later announced that Clark would be unable to host his annual ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' broadcast.<ref name="youtube.com">{{YouTube|id=MhP0EbjwNM4|title=New Years Eve at Times Square - 2004-5 - with Regis Philbin!!}}</ref> Clark returned to the series the following year, but the [[dysarthria]] that resulted from the stroke rendered him unable to speak clearly for the remainder of his life. He also suffered from [[Coronary artery disease]] in his last years.

Following his death, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] praised Clark's career: "With ''American Bandstand'', he introduced decades' worth of viewers to the music of our times. He reshaped the television landscape forever as a creative and innovative producer. And, of course, for 40 years, we welcomed him into our homes to ring in the New Year."<ref name="AP death">{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQJFW1m-ogVl_Q0eo-gQ4pthPvZg | title=Celebrities react to the death of Dick Clark | accessdate=April 20, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>
[[Motown]] founder [[Berry Gordy]] and singer [[Diana Ross]] spoke of Clark's impact on the recording industry: "Dick was always there for me and Motown, even before there was a Motown. He was an [[entrepreneur]], a visionary and a major force in changing pop culture and ultimately influencing integration," Gordy said. "He presented Motown and the Supremes on tour with the "[[Caravan of Stars]]" and on ''American Bandstand'', where I got my start."
