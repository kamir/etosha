'''Janis Ian''' (born '''Janis Eddy Fink'''; April 7, 1951) is a singer-songwriter who was mostly active in the 1960s and 1970s; her most successful song  "[[At Seventeen]]", was released as a single from her 1975 album ''[[Between the Lines (Janis Ian album)|Between the Lines]]'' which reached number 1 on the Billboard chart.

Born in 1951 in New York, Ian entered the American [[folk music]] scene while still a teenager in the mid-1960s. Most active musically in that decade and the 1970s, she has continued recording into the 21st century. She has won two [[Grammy Awards]], the first in 1975 for "At Seventeen", and the second in 2013 for [[Best Spoken Word Album]], for her autobiography, ''Society's Child'' (nearly 40 years later).

Ian is also a columnist and [[science fiction author]].<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.janisian.com/press/JanisIan2006Bio.pdf|title=Janis Ian: A Life in Song|format=PDF|work=Janis Ian Website|year=2006|accessdate=2007-06-09|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070507222117/http://janisian.com/press/JanisIan2006Bio.pdf|archivedate=May 7, 2007}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born to a [[Jewish American|Jewish]] family in New York City,<ref name="musicguide">{{cite book|title=All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues|editor=Bogdanov, Vladimir; Woodstra, Chris; and Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|year=2003|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-736-6|first=Jason|last=Ankeny}}</ref> she was primarily raised in [[New Jersey]], initially on a farm, and attended [[East Orange Campus High School|East Orange High School]] in [[East Orange, New Jersey]]<ref>Nash, Margo. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DC1631F935A25750C0A9659C8B63 "JERSEY FOOTLIGHTS"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 16, 2003; accessed December 19, 2007. "Yet when Janis Ian went to East Orange High School, she was kicked out of the chorus."</ref> and the [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts|New York City High School of Music & Art]]. Her parents, Victor, a music teacher, and Pearl, ran a summer camp in upstate New York. In that [[Cold War]] era they were frequently under government surveillance because of their left-wing politics. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

As a child she admired the work of folk pioneers such as [[Joan Baez]] and [[Odetta]]. Starting with piano lessons at the age of six or seven, Ian, by the time she entered her teens, had learned the organ, harpsichord, French horn, flute and guitar.<ref>''Life Magazine'', October 27, 1967, p. 53</ref> At the age of 12, she wrote her first song, "Hair of Spun Gold," which was subsequently published in the folk publication ''Broadside'' and was later recorded for her debut album. In 1964, she legally changed her name to Janis Ian. Her new last name was her brother, Eric's, middle name.<ref name="musicguide"/>

==Music career==
At the age of 13, Ian wrote and sang her first hit single, "[[Society's Child|Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking)]]", about an interracial romance forbidden by a girl's mother and frowned upon by her peers and teachers. Produced by [[Shadow Morton|George "Shadow" Morton]] and released three times from 1965 to 1967, "Society's Child" finally became a national hit upon its third release after [[Leonard Bernstein]] featured it in a CBS TV special titled ''Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution.''<ref name="musicguide"/>

The song's lyrical content was taboo for some radio stations, {{Clarify|date=October 2014}} and they withdrew or banned it from their playlists accordingly; in her 2008 autobiography ''Society's Child'', Ian recalls receiving hate mail and death threats as a response to the song, and mentions that a radio station in Atlanta that played it was burned down. In the summer of 1967, "Society's Child" reached #14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the single having sold 600,000 copies, and the album 350,000.<ref>''Life Magazine'', October 27, 1967 p. 53</ref>

Ian relates on her website that, although the song was originally intended for [[Atlantic Records]] and the label paid for her recording session, the label subsequently returned the [[Master recording|master]] to her and quietly refused to release it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/janis_ian/|title=Janis Ian interview (March 14, 2003)|publisher=Songfacts|accessdate=September 27, 2012|author=Wiser, Carl}}</ref> Years later, Ian says, Atlantic's president at the time, [[Jerry Wexler]], publicly apologized to her for this. The single and Ian's 1967 eponymous debut album were finally released on [[Verve Forecast]]; her album was also a hit, reaching #29. In 2001, "Society's Child" was inducted into the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Q-Z|Grammy Hall of Fame]], which honors recordings considered timeless and important to [[music history]]. Her early music was compiled on a double CD entitled ''Society's Child: The Verve Recordings'' in 1995.

"Society's Child" stigmatized Ian as a one-hit wonder until her most successful single in the United States, "[[At Seventeen]]", a bittersweet commentary on adolescent [[cruelty]], the illusion of popularity, and teenage [[angst]], as reflected upon from the perspective of a 24-year-old, was released in 1975. "At Seventeen" was a major hit, receiving tremendous acclaim from critics and record buyers alike—it charted at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It won the 1975 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female]] beating out [[Linda Ronstadt]], who was nominated for her ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'' album; [[Olivia Newton-John]]; and [[Helen Reddy]]. Ian performed "At Seventeen" as a musical guest on the debut of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on October 11, 1975. The song's album, ''[[Between the Lines (Janis Ian album)|Between the Lines]]'', was also a smash and hit #1 on Billboard's Album chart. It was quickly certified Gold and later earned a 'Platinum' certification for sales of over one million copies sold in the US. Another measure of her success is anecdotal: on Valentine's Day 1977, Ian received 461 Valentine cards, having indicated in the lyrics to "At Seventeen" that she never received any as a teenager.<ref name=dafydd>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rock Stars|first=Dafydd|last=Rees|author2=Luke Crampton|year=1996|publisher=Dk Pub|isbn=0-7894-1263-2}}</ref>

"Fly Too High" (1979), produced by [[disco]] producer [[Giorgio Moroder]], was Ian's contribution to the soundtrack of the [[Jodie Foster]] film ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]'', also featured on Ian's 1979 album ''Night Rains''. It earned her a [[Grammy]] nomination and became a hit single in many countries, including South Africa, Belgium. Australia, [[Israel]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Another country where Ian has achieved a high level of popularity is Japan. Ian had two top 10 singles on the Japanese [[Oricon]] charts, "Love Is Blind" in 1976, and "You Are Love" in 1980.

Ian's album ''[[Aftertones]]'' topped Oricon's album chart in October 1976.<ref name="officialwebsite"/> "You Are Love (Toujours Gai Mon Cher)" is the theme song of [[Kinji Fukasaku]]'s 1980 movie ''[[Virus (1980 film)|Virus]]''. She cut several other singles specifically for the Japanese market, including 1998's "The Last Great Place". She reached the pop charts only once more after "At Seventeen" ("[[Under the Covers (song)|Under the Covers]]", #71 in 1981), though she had several more songs reach the [[Adult Contemporary]] singles chart through 1980 (all failing to make the Top 20, however). She walked away from her CBS contract in 1982 with three albums to go. She spent much of the 1980s and early 1990s without a record deal. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

From 1982–92, Ian continued to write songs, often in collaboration with then-songwriting partner Kye Fleming, which have been covered by, among others, [[Amy Grant]], [[Bette Midler]] and [[Marti Jones]]. She released ''[[Breaking Silence]]'' in 1993,  going public that she is a lesbian.<ref name="keehnen">{{cite web|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Keehnen/Ian.html|title=At 42: Lesbian Legend Janis Ian Comes Out|first=Owen|last=Keehnen|date=March 24, 2005|publisher=Queer Culture Center|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The album, ''Folk Is The New Black'', was released jointly by the Rude Girl and Cooking Vinyl labels in 2006, her first in more than two decades.<ref name="dbw">{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.org/TTPOJanisIan.html|title=Trying The Patience Of: Janis Ian|first=David Bertrand|last=Wilson|work=Wilson & Alroy's Record Reviews|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref>
 
Other artists have recorded Ian's compositions, including [[Roberta Flack]], who had a hit in 1973 with Ian's song "Jesse".<ref name="keehnen"/> Ian's own version is included on the 1974 album ''Stars'' (the title song of which has also been oft-covered, including versions by [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Cher]], [[Nina Simone]] and [[Barbara Cook]]). She continues to tour, with a round of concerts scheduled for the United Kingdom in 2014, and a series of appearances in the US after that.<ref name="officialwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.janisian.com/ontour.php|title=Janis Ian: On Tour|publisher=janisian.com|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Criticism of the RIAA==
She is an outspoken critic of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA),<ref name=debacle>{{cite web|url=http://www.janisian.com/article-internet_debacle.html|title=The Internet Debacle – An Alternative View|first=Janis|last=Ian|work=[[Performing Songwriter Magazine]]|date=May 2002|accessdate=2007-06-09|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070509181400/http://www.janisian.com/article-internet_debacle.html|archivedate=May 9, 2007}}</ref> a [[record industry]] organization which she sees as acting against the interests of musicians and consumers. As such, she has willingly released several of her songs for free download from her website.<ref>[http://www.janisian.com/mp3_downloads.html Free Music Downloads] on Janis Ian's official website</ref> Along with [[science fiction author]]s [[Eric Flint]] and [[Cory Doctorow]], she has argued that their experience provides conclusive evidence that free downloads dramatically increased hard-copy sales, contrary to the claims of RIAA and [[NARAS]].<ref>[http://www.baen.com/library/palaver11.htm Prime Palaver #11] – letter by Janis Ian to [[Baen Free Library#Letters to and from Baen's first librarian|Baen librarian]], Eric Flint, September 16, 2002</ref> Ian's signature tune "[[At Seventeen]]" sold over two million singles in the United States alone yet was never certified.

"I've been surprised at how few people are willing to get annoyed with me over it," she laughs. "There was a little backlash here and there. I was scheduled to appear on a panel somewhere and somebody from a record company said if I was there they would boycott it. But that's been pretty much it. In general the entire reaction has been favorable. I hear from a lot of people in my industry who don't want to be quoted, but say 'yeah, we're aware of this and we'd like to see a change too.'"<ref name=towerofbabel>{{cite web|url=http://towerofbabel.com/sections/music/troubadours/janisian/|title=Janis Ian: Doing It From The Heart|first=Jan|last=Vanderhorst|date=October 2002|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>

==Writing and editing==
[[File:Janis Ian.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ian at a [[Borders Group|Borders book signing]] in 2005]]

Ian writes science fiction. A long-time reader of the genre, she got into [[science fiction fandom]] in 2001, attending the [[Millennium Philcon]]. Her short stories have been published in anthologies, and she co-edited, with [[Mike Resnick]], the anthology ''Stars: Original Stories Based on the Songs of Janis Ian'', published in 2003 (ISBN 978-0-7564-0177-1). She occasionally attends [[science fiction conventions]].<ref>{{cite web|author=John Teehan|url=http://www.sff.net/people/jdteehan/report.html|title=Janis at Worldcon 2001|publisher=Sff.net|accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>

Ian has been a regular columnist for, and still contributes to the [[LGBT]] news magazine, ''[[The Advocate]]''.<ref name="oasis">[http://www.oasismag.com/Issues/9603/oasis-coverstory.html "Revenge is sweet for Janis Ian"] by Jeff Walsh, March 1, 1996</ref> She has a selection of her columns available on her website. She contributed a column to ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine from 1995–2003. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

On July 24, 2008, Ian released her autobiography ''Society's Child'' (published by [[Penguin Tarcher]]) <!-- ISBN needed -->to much critical acclaim. An accompanying double CD, ''The Autobiography Collection'', has been released with many of Ian's best loved songs. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Personal life==
Janis married Portuguese filmmaker Tino Sargo in 1978; they divorced in 1983. Details of Sargo's physical and emotional abuse were discussed in Ian's autobiography, ''Society's Child''.<ref name="Ian 2008">Ian, Janis. 2008. ''Society's Child: My Autobiography.'' New York City: Tarcher.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> After moving to Nashville, she met Patricia Snyder in 1989. Ian came out as a lesbian in 1993 with the worldwide release of her album ''[[Breaking Silence]]''.<ref name="keehnen"/> Snyder and Ian married in [[Toronto]] on August 27, 2003.<ref name="glbtq">{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/ian_j.html|title=Ian profile|publisher=Glbtq.com|accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref> Ian has a stepdaughter and two grandchildren by Snyder.

Ian's mother, Pearl, was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1975. Ian and her brother convinced Pearl to pursue her lifelong dream of going to college. Pearl eventually enrolled in [[Goddard College]]'s adult education program, ultimately graduating with a Master's degree. After Pearl's death, Ian decided to auction off memorabilia and raise money to endow a scholarship at Goddard specifically for older [[continuing education]] students. This began what became the Pearl Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. At the end of each year, 90% or more of funds raised from sale of merchandise, donations from fans, and contributions from Ian herself are disbursed to various educational institutions to fund "Pearl Foundation scholarships". To date, it has contributed over $800,000 in scholarship funds, including [[Warren Wilson College]].<ref name="Ian 2008"/>
