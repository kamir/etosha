'''Iran''' ({{lang-fa|ايران}}), once known as '''Persia''', is a [[country]] in [[West Asia]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |title=Iran Country Profile |publisher=BBC NEWS |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541327 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cesww.fas.harvard.edu/ces_definition.html |title="CESWW" – Definition of Central Eurasia |publisher=Cesww.fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_iran.html |title=Iran Guide |publisher=National Geographic |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> It is part of the [[Middle East]] region. It shares [[border]]s  with [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], and [[Turkmenistan]].

[[Tehran]] is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] and biggest [[city]]. Iran is the eighteenth largest country in the world. It has more than 70 million people. Iran has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1945. It is a member of the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).<ref>http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml</ref> It is an [[Islamic republic]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Iran}}
In the past, Iran was called "Persia" by people outside of the [[country]]. The people that lived there called the country "Iran". The official name was Persia. The name Persia was used when dealing with other countries and in [[government]] papers. 

In 1935, [[Reza Shāh Pahlavi]] was [[shāh]] of Iran. He officially renamed the country "Iran". This was done to show that Iran belongs to all the non-Persian Iranians as well as to Persian Iranians. The name Iran means ''land of the [[Aryan]]s''. It is used in the ancient book of the [[Zoroastrian]]s, the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]]. In the 19th and early 20th century, the name ''Aryan'' was used by [[Europe]]ans to mean ''all [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]]s''.  The "Aryan Race" was a term that [[Adolph Hitler|Hitler]] used to describe his "Superior" or "perfect" race, but it first meant Iranians.<ref>Norton, 2002</ref>

=== Persian Empire ===

Around 500 BC, the area that is now Iran was the center of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city states fought against the Persian armies led by [[Darius the Great]] and [[Xerxes]]. Then [[Alexander the Great]] took the country by fighting the Achaemenid dynasty of [[Persia]]. He later ruled. 

After them, the Sassanian dynasty (224-651) took over. Other people took Persia by [[war|fighting]], like the [[Arab]]s (7th century), [[Turk]]s (10th century) and [[Mongols]] (13th century).  However, Iran has always had a different [[culture]] and continued to survive.

=== New Iran ===
{{further|Islamic Revolution}}
The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) worked in Iran to create [[riot]]s which led to the removal of [[Prime Minister]] Mosaddegh. The [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] then made the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] [[King]] of Iran, again. When the Shah left Iran, he had ruled for less than a year. The Iranian [[government]] was changed to an [[Islamic Republic]] by [[Islamic Revolution]].  Soon afterwards, the [[Iranian Students Movement]] (Tahkim Vahdat), with the backing of the new [[government]], took over the [[U.S.]] [[Embassy]] in [[Tehran]]. They held most of the [[diplomat]]s [[hostage]] for 444 days.  

Relations between the two countries have not been good since. For example, the [[United States]] claims that Iran supports [[terrorist]] [[group]]s against [[Israel]]. Iran does not see Israel as a country. Iran, along with most [[Arab]] countries, believes that Israel does not have the [[right]] to exist.  

Iran defended itself against Iraqi invasion in 1980. That [[war]] that lasted eight years. Many Arab and Western countries, including the [[United States]], provided [[weapon]]s and technical support for Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]]. Those weapons included biological and chemical [[weapon]]s of mass destruction. 

Now, the [[Western world|West]] is trying to prevent Iran from using [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear technology]], even though Iran is a member of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has reported many times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, it also says that it can not say for sure that Iran is not doing so in [[secret]]. 

A December 2007 [[CIA]] report on nuclear activity in Iran daid that Iran's [[secret]] program to get nuclear [[weapon]]s [[technology]] was stopped in 2003. It said that Iran will probably not be able to build a nuclear [[weapon]] soon.

== Economy ==
Iran has the [[natural resource]] of [[Petroleum|oil]]. It is a member of OPEC. Oil is one of its main exports. [[Rice]], handicrafts, [[carpet]]s and [[crocus]] are important local products. Iran is the world's largest exporter and producer of [[caviar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russiran.com/en/iranian-products/foods/caviar.html|title=Caviar|publisher=Russia-Iran.com|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref>

[[Rial]] is the [[money]] used in Iran.

== Religion in Iran ==

About 98% of Iranian people are [[Muslim]]. The [[state religion]] is [[Shia Islam]]. It has been the state religion since the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark W. Janis, Carolyn Maree Evans|title=Religion and International Law|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8CxMFjU12OUC&pg=PA381|page=381|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1999|isbn=9789041111746}}</ref> This is the religion of about 90% of Iranians.<ref name="cia">

The 2% of Iranians who are not Muslim are [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Mandaeism|Mandeans]], [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Christian]]s and [[Judaism|Jews]].<ref name="cia"/>
