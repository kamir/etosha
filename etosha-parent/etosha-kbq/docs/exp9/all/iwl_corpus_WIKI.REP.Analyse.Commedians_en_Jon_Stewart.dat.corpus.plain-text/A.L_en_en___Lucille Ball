'''Lucille Désirée Ball''' (August 6, 1911 – April 26, 1989) was an American actress, comedian, model, and film studio executive. She was the star of the sitcoms ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', and ''[[Life with Lucy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/lucille-ball/person/10038/biography.html|title=Lucille Ball Bio|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=tv.com}}</ref>

Ball's career in the spotlight began in 1929, when she landed work as a model. Shortly thereafter, Lucille began her performing career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] using the [[stage names|stage name]] Diane Belmont and Dianne Belmont. She performed many small movie roles in the 1930s and 1940s as a contract player for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], being cast as a chorus girl, or in similar roles, and was dubbed the "Queen of the Bs" (referring to her many roles in [[B-film]]s).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. In the midst of her work as a control player for RKO, Ball met Cuban [[bandleader]] [[Desi Arnaz]]. The two [[Elopement (marriage)|eloped]] in 1940.

During the 1950s, Lucille Ball became a television star. In 1951, Ball and Arnaz created the television series ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', a show that would go on to be one of the most beloved programs in television history. On July 17, 1951, at almost forty years of age, Ball gave birth to their first child, [[Lucie Arnaz|Lucie Désirée Arnaz]].<ref name="Lucie"/> A year and a half later, she gave birth to their second child, [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV, known as Desi Arnaz, Jr.]]<ref name="twoop-bio"/> Ball and Arnaz divorced on May 4, 1960.

In 1962, Ball became the first woman to run a major [[television studio]], [[Desilu Productions|Desilu]]. Her studio produced many successful and popular [[television series]], including ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.<ref>"Arnaz Quits Presidency Of Desilu; Former Wife, Lucille Ball, Gets Post", ''Wall Street Journal'', November 9, 1962, p. 18.</ref> She continued making film and television appearances for most of the rest of her life, albeit without ever attaining the success she enjoyed in the 1950s.

Ball was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] thirteen times and won four times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punoftheday.com/lucille-ball.html|title=Lucille Ball: Biography|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=punoftheday.com|quote=Ball wins four Emmys and nominated for a total of 13}}</ref> In 1977, Ball was among the first recipients of the Women in Film [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]].<ref name=WIF>{{cite web|title=Past Recipients: Crystal Award|url=http://wif.org/past-recipients|work=Women In Film|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref> She was the recipient of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B.

On April 26, 1989, Ball died of an [[Dissecting aortic aneurysm|abdominal aortic dissection]] at the age of seventy-seven.<ref name="Morbid">{{cite web|url=http://www.morbid-curiosity.com/id125.htm|title=Lucille Ball|accessdate=April 6, 2008|publisher= Morbid Curiosity|quote=Lucille Ball is recovering and dies}}</ref> At the time of her death, she had been married to [[standup comedian]] [[Gary Morton]], her business partner and second husband, for more than twenty-seven years.{{sfn|Sanders|Gilbert|1993|p=216}}

==Early life==
Ball was born to Henry Durrell Ball (September 16, 1887&nbsp;– February 28, 1915) and Désirée "DeDe" Evelyn Hunt (September 21, 1892&nbsp;– July 20, 1977) in [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]], in the [[Western New York|far western part of the state]]. Ball and her family, following her father's death in 1915, moved to nearby [[Celoron, New York|Celoron]] and lived there as a child with her grandparents. She later sometimes claimed she had been born in [[Butte, Montana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/lucy_related2.html|title=Time Life|accessdate=April 2, 2008|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|deadurl=yes|postscript=About Lucille Ball's relatives|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080406060542/http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/lucy_related2.html|archivedate=April 6, 2008}}</ref>

A number of magazines reported inaccurately that she had decided that Montana was a more romantic place to be born than New York and repeated a fantasy of a “Western childhood”; in fact, her father had moved the family there briefly for work, among other places.<ref name="Higham 1986">Higham , C.

Her father, a telephone [[Lineman (occupation)|lineman]] for [[Bell Telephone Company]], was frequently transferred because of his occupation. Within three years of her birth, Lucille had moved with her parents from Jamestown to [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]], and then to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]].<ref name="Cavett"/> While DeDe Ball was pregnant with her second child, [[Fred Ball|Frederick]], Henry Ball contracted [[typhoid fever]] and died in February 1915.{{sfn|Herringshaw|2011|pp=17–19}} Ball recalled little from the day her father died, but remembered a bird getting trapped in the house. From that day forward, she suffered from [[ornithophobia]].{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=12}}

After her father died, her mother returned to New York and her parents. Ball and her brother, Fred Henry Ball (July 17, 1915&nbsp;– February 5, 2007), were raised by their mother and maternal grandparents in [[Celoron, New York]], a summer resort village on [[Lake Chautauqua]], just west of Jamestown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucille Ball Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ba-Be/Ball-Lucille.html|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Lucy loved Celoron Park, one of the best amusement areas in the United States at that time. Its boardwalk had a ramp to the lake as a children’s slide, the Pier Ballroom, roller-coaster, bandstand, and a stage where vaudeville, concerts, and regular theatrical shows were presented, all making the Park an entertainment destination.<ref name="Higham 1986"/> Her grandfather, Fred Hunt, was an eccentric who also enjoyed the theater. He frequently took the family to [[vaudeville]] shows and encouraged young Lucy to take part in both her own and school plays. {{Citation needed| date=March 2012}}

Four years after the death of her father, Ball’s mother DeDe remarried, to Edward Peterson. While her mother and stepfather looked for work in another city, Ball and her brother were cared for by her stepfather’s parents. Ball’s new guardians were a [[puritanical]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] couple who banished all mirrors from the house except for one over the bathroom sink. When the young Ball was caught admiring herself in it, she was severely chastised for being vain.{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=23}} This period of time affected Ball so deeply that in later life she claimed that it lasted seven or eight years.{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=24}} Peterson was a [[Shriners|Shriner]]. When his organization needed female entertainers for the [[chorus line]] of their next show, he encouraged his twelve-year-old stepdaughter to audition.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=16}} While Ball was onstage, she realized performing was a great way to gain praise and recognition. Her appetite for recognition had thus been awakened at an early age.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=20}} In 1927 her family suffered misfortune. Their house and furnishings were lost to settle a financial [[legal judgment]], after a neighborhood boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone [[target shooting]] in their yard under Ball's grandfather's supervision. The family moved into a small apartment in Jamestown.{{sfn|Ball|1996|p=41}}

==Career==

===Teenage years and early career===
In 1925 Ball, then only 14, started dating Johnny DeVita, a 23-year-old local hood. DeDe was unhappy with the relationship, but was unable to influence her daughter to end it. She expected the romance to burn out in a few weeks, but that did not happen. After about a year, DeDe tried to separate them by using Lucille's desire to be in show business. Despite the family's meager finances, she arranged for Lucille to go to the [[John Murray Anderson]] School for the Dramatic Arts in New York City,{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=24}} where [[Bette Davis]] was a fellow student. Ball later said about that time in her life, "All I learned in drama school was how to be frightened."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=205}}

Ball was determined to prove her teachers wrong and returned to New York City in 1928. Among her other jobs, she landed work as a fashion model for [[Hattie Carnegie]].{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=30}} Her career was thriving when she became ill, either with [[rheumatic fever]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], or an unknown illness, and was unable to work for two years.<ref name="NetGlimse"/> She moved back to New York City in 1932 to resume her pursuit of a career as an actress and supported herself by again working for Carnegie{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=33}} and as the [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]] [[cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girl]]. Using the name Diane (sometimes spelled Dianne) Belmont, she started getting some chorus work on Broadway{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=28}} but the work was not lasting.  Ball was hired&nbsp;– but then quickly fired&nbsp;– by theatre [[impresario]] [[Earl Carroll]], from his ''Vanities'', and by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], from a touring company of ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]''.<ref name="titleLucille Ball at Hollywood.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Lucille_Ball/199957|title=Lucille Ball at Hollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|quote=Lucille Ball's stage name|archiveurl=http://archive.is/OK4bw|archivedate=January 26, 2013}}</ref> She was let go from the [[Shubert brothers]] production of ''Stepping Stones''. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Hollywood===
After an uncredited stint as a [[Goldwyn Girls|Goldwyn Girl]] in ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' (1933), starring [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Gloria Stuart]], Ball moved permanently to Hollywood to appear in films. She appeared in many small movie roles in the 1930s as a contract player for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], including a two-reel comedy short with the [[Three Stooges]] (''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', 1934) and a movie with the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]'', 1938). She can also be seen as one of the featured models in the [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] film ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), briefly as the flower girl in ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), as well as in a brief [[supporting role]] at the beginning of ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=103863 |title=Lucille Ball|accessdate=April 5, 2008|publisher=Everything2.com|quote=Ball and Rogers are lifelong friends}}</ref> another Astaire-Rogers film. Ginger Rogers was a distant maternal cousin of Ball's. She and Rogers played aspiring actresses in the film ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937), co-starring [[Katharine Hepburn]].

In 1936 she also landed the role she hoped would lead her to Broadway, in the [[Bartlett Cormack]] play ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'', a comedy set in a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] apartment in Hollywood. The play premiered in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|New Jersey]], on January 21, 1937 with Ball playing the part of Julie Tucker, "one of three roommates coping with neurotic directors, confused executives, and grasping stars who interfere with the girls' ability to get ahead."<ref name="Brady2001">{{cite book|last=Brady|first=Kathleen|title=Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w82Ltm6taMAC&pg=PA73|accessdate=December 26, 2012|year=2001|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8230-8913-0|page=73}}</ref> The play received good reviews, but there were problems, chiefly with its star, [[Conway Tearle]], who was in poor health. Cormack wanted to replace him, but the producer, [[Anne Nichols]], said the fault lay with the character and insisted that the part needed to be reshaped and rewritten. The two were unable to agree on a solution. The play was scheduled to open on Broadway at the [[Vanderbilt Theatre]], but closed after one week in Washington, D.C. when Tearle suddenly became gravely ill.{{sfn|Brady|2001|pp=73–74}}

Ball was signed to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in the 1940s, but she never achieved major stardom from her appearance in the studio's films.<ref name="isbn1550225901 ">{{cite book|author=Crouse, Richard J.|title=The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto|year=2003|page=196|isbn=1-55022-590-1|quote="Stage Door" gives Ball her big break}}</ref> She was known in many Hollywood circles as "Queen of the B's"&nbsp;– a title previously held by [[Fay Wray]]&nbsp;– starring in a number of [[B-movie]]s, such as ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (1939). Like many budding actresses Ball picked up radio work to earn side income as well as gain exposure. In 1937 she appeared regularly on ''The [[Phil Baker (comedian)|Phil Baker]] Show''.

When that completed its run in 1938, Ball joined the cast of ''The Wonder Show'' starring [[Jack Haley]] (best remembered as the [[Tin Woodman|Tin man]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', 1939). It was here that she began her fifty-year professional relationship with [[Gale Gordon]], who served as show announcer. ''The Wonder Show'' lasted one season, with the final episode airing on April 7, 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lucyfan.com/wondershow.html|title="The Wonder Show"&nbsp;– 1938 Radio Series&nbsp;– Starring Jack Haley, with Lucille Ball & Gale Gordon |accessdate=April 9, 2008|publisher=The Wonder Show|quote=Lucy and The Wonder Show}}</ref> [[MGM]] producer [[Arthur Freed]] purchased the Broadway hit musical play ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1943) especially for [[Ann Sothern]], but when Sothern turned down the part the choice role was awarded to Ball, who in real life was Sothern's best friend. In 1946 Ball starred in ''[[Lover Come Back (1946 film)|Lover Come Back]]'' and, in 1948, made an uncredited appearance as Sally Elliot in ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|The Fuller Brush Man]].''

===''I Love Lucy'' and Desilu===
[[File:Lucy in scotland 1956.JPG|thumb|A scene from "Lucy Goes to Scotland", 1956]]
In 1948, Ball was cast as Liz Cugat (later "Cooper"), a wacky wife, in ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', a radio program for [[CBS Radio]]. The program was successful, and CBS asked her to develop it for television. She agreed, but insisted on working with her real-life husband, Cuban bandleader [[Desi Arnaz]]. CBS executives were reluctant, thinking the public would not accept an All-American redhead and a Cuban as a couple. CBS was initially not impressed with the pilot episode produced by the couple's [[Desilu Productions]] company, so the couple toured the road in a [[vaudeville]] act with Lucy as the zany housewife wanting to get in Arnaz's show. The tour was a great success, and CBS put ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' into their lineup.<ref name="title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The ''I Love Lucy'' show was not only a star vehicle for Lucille Ball, but a way for her to try to salvage her marriage to Desi Arnaz, which had become badly strained, in part by both having hectic performing schedules which often kept them apart.

Along the way, she created a television dynasty and reached several "firsts." Ball was the first woman in television to be head of a production company: Desilu, the company that she and Arnaz formed. After their divorce, Ball bought out Arnaz's share of the studio, and she proceeded to function as a very active studio head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/previews/american_masters_lucy|title=American Masters "Lucille Ball: Finding Lucy"|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|quote=Ball first woman to head a major studio}}</ref> Desilu and ''I Love Lucy'' pioneered a number of methods still in use in television production today such as filming before a [[live studio audience]] with a number of cameras, and distinct [[Stage set|sets]] adjacent to each other.<ref name="titleDesi Arnaz">{{cite web|url=http://lucille-ball.info/desi-arnaz-biography|title=Desi Arnaz|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=Lucille Ball Info|quote=Arnaz revolutionizes television}}</ref> During this time Ball taught a thirty-two week [[comedy workshop]] at the [[Brandeis-Bardin Institute]]. Ball was quoted as saying, "You cannot teach someone comedy; either they have it or they don't."{{sfn|Karol|2004|p=201}}

Ball and Arnaz wanted to remain in their Los Angeles home, but the [[Time zones in the U.S.|time zone]] logistics made that broadcast norm impossible. Prime time in L.A. was too late at night on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to air a major network series, meaning the majority of the TV audience would be seeing not only the inferior picture of [[kinescope]]s but seeing them at least a day later.<ref name="titleI Love Lucy Turns 50 - Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, background info on influential, groundbreaking TV comedy|USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)|Find Articles at BNET.com">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2676_130/ai_78256901|title="I Love Lucy" Turns 50&nbsp;– Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, background info on influential, groundbreaking TV comedy|publisher=USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)|accessdate=April 5, 2008|quote=Arnaz did not want kinescope|first=Wes|last=Gehring|year=2001}}</ref>

Sponsor [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] did not want to show day-old kinescopes to the major markets on the East Coast, yet neither did they want to pay for the extra cost that filming, processing, and editing would require, pressuring Ball and Arnaz to relocate to New York City. Ball and Arnaz offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, on the condition that their company, Desilu, would retain the rights to that film once it was aired. CBS relinquished the show rights to Desilu after initial broadcast, not realizing they were giving away a valuable and durable asset. In 1957, CBS bought the rights back for one million dollars, which provided Ball and Arnaz the down payment for the purchase of the former [[RKO Pictures|RKO Studios]], which became Desilu Studios.<ref>Cushman, Marc; ''These Are the Voyages, Vol. 1''; Jacobs/Brown Press; San Diego, CA, USA; 2013; p. 27</ref>

[[File:Lucille Ball John Wayne 1955.JPG|thumb||left|With [[John Wayne]] in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', 1955]]
''I Love Lucy'' dominated the ratings in the United States for most of its run. (There was an attempt to adapt the show for radio; the cast and writers adapted the memorable "Breaking the Lease" episode — in which the Ricardos and Mertzes fall out over an argument, the Ricardos threaten to move, but they're stuck in a firm lease — for a radio audition disc that never aired but has survived.)<ref>[https://archive.org/download/Singles_And_Doubles_Singles_H-K/52-02-26_xxx_I_Love_Lucy_-_Breaking_The_Lease.mp3](mp3) – archive.org</ref> A scene in which Lucy and Ricky are practicing the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], in the episode "Lucy Does The Tango", evoked the longest recorded studio audience laugh in the history of the show; so long that the [[Tango (dance)|sound editor]] had to cut that particular part of the soundtrack in half.<ref name="isbn0-8230-8456-6">{{cite book|author=Hofstede, David|title=5000 Episodes and No Commercials: The Ultimate Guide to TV Shows on DVD 2007|publisher=Back Stage Books|location=New York|year=2006|page=149|isbn=0-8230-8456-6|quote=Longest laugh in television history|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref> During the show's production breaks they starred together in two feature films: ''[[The Long, Long Trailer]]'' (1954) and ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956). Desilu produced several other popular shows, such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and ''[[Mission: Impossible]]''. Desilu was eventually sold for $17,000,000 and merged into [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1967.<ref>Cushman, Marc; ''These Are the Voyages, Vol. 2''; Jacobs/Brown Press; San Diego, CA, USA; 2014; p. 307</ref>

==Later career==
The 1960 Broadway musical ''Wildcat'' ended its run early when Ball became too ill to continue in the show.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=220}} The show was the source of the song she made famous, "Hey, Look Me Over," which she performed with Paula Stewart on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. She made a few more movies including ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine, and Ours]]'' (1968), and the musical ''[[Mame (film)|Mame]]'' (1974), and two more successful long-running sitcoms for CBS: ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' (1962–68), which costarred Vivian Vance and [[Gale Gordon]], and ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' (1968–74), which also featured Gordon, as well as Lucy's real life children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. She appeared on the [[Dick Cavett]] show in 1974 and spoke of her history and life with Arnaz. She revealed how she felt about other actors and actresses as well as her love for Arnaz. Ball revealed in this interview that the strangest thing to ever happen to her was after she had some dental work completed and having lead fillings put in her teeth, she started hearing radio stations in her head. She explained that going home one night from the studio, as she passed one area, she heard what she thought was [[morse code]] or a "tapping". She stated that "as I backed up it got stronger. The next morning, I reported it to the authorities and upon investigation, they found a Japanese [[radio transmitter]] that had been buried and was actively transmitting codes back to the Japanese."{{sfn|Karol|2004|p=164}}<ref name="snopes">{{cite web|title=Brace Yourself|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/fillings.asp|date=August 5, 2007|publisher=snopes.com|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

Ball was originally considered by [[Frank Sinatra]] for the role of Mrs. Iselin in the Cold War thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]''.

==Personal life==

===Marriage, children, and divorce===
In 1940, Ball met Cuban-born bandleader [[Desi Arnaz]] while filming the [[Rodgers and Hart]] stage hit ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. When they met again on the second day, the two connected immediately and eloped the same year. Although Arnaz was drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]] in 1942, he ended up being classified for limited service due to a knee injury.<ref name="TCM">{{cite web| title=Arnaz, Desi | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/5686%7C37992/Desi-Arnaz/biography.html | publisher=tcm.com| date=| accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref> As a result, Arnaz stayed in Los Angeles, organizing and performing [[USO]] shows for wounded [[G.I. (military)|GI's]] being brought back from the Pacific. That same year, Ball appeared opposite [[Henry Fonda]] in ''[[The Big Street]]'', in which she plays a paralyzed nightclub singer and Fonda portrays a [[busboy]] who idolizes her. The following year Ball appeared in ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|DuBarry Was a Lady]]'', a film for which the natural brunette first had her hair dyed the flaming red that would become her screen trademark. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Ball originally filed for divorce in 1944, going so far as obtaining an [[interlocutory decree]]; however, she reconciled with Arnaz and stopped the proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/lucilleballbi_rtkn.htm|title=Lucille Ball biography|accessdate=April 5, 2008|publisher=Essortment.com|quote=Ball and Arnaz patch things up before divorce became final}}</ref> Even though the couple were only six years apart in age, many apparently believed that it was less socially acceptable for an [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|older woman to marry a younger man]], and hence split the difference in their ages, both claiming a 1914 birth date until this was disproved some years later.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

On July 17, 1951, one month before her 40th birthday, Ball gave birth to her first child, [[Lucie Arnaz|Lucie Désirée Arnaz]].<ref name="Lucie"/> A year and a half later, Ball gave birth to her second child, [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV]], known as Desi Arnaz, Jr.<ref name="twoop-bio"/> Before he was born, ''I Love Lucy'' was a solid ratings hit, and Ball and Arnaz wrote the pregnancy into the show. (Ball's necessary and planned [[caesarean section]] in real life was scheduled for the same date that her television character gave birth.)<ref name="twoop-bio"/> There were several challenges from CBS, insisting that a pregnant woman could not be shown on television, nor could the word "pregnant" be spoken on-air.

The country was in an uproar over Lucy’s approaching delivery through the winter of 1952. Even the coverage of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]’s winning the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 U.S. presidential election]] had to battle for media time against Lucy's special event. On January 14, 1953, reports flew around that baby Ricardo would be born on the following Monday’s show. Thousands called the studio and the Hollywood Press Office, demanding to know the details. January 19 would be a date to be remembered in the records of television history. Eisenhower’s swearing-in ceremony had an audience of 29 million people, while 44 million watched Lucy Ricardo welcome little Ricky.<ref name="Higham 1986"/>  The birth made the first cover of ''[[TV Guide]]'' for the week of April 3–9, 1953. Lucy appeared on the cover of TV Guide more times than any other star in the history of the magazine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Lucille Ball, famous TV clown |url=http://lucille-ball.info/biography-of-lucille-ball/ |publisher=Lucille Ball Info |accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref>

In October 1956, Ball, [[Vivian Vance]], Desi Arnaz, and [[William Frawley]] all appeared on a [[Bob Hope]] special on [[NBC]], including a spoof of ''I Love Lucy'', the only time all four stars were together on a color [[Broadcasting|telecast]]. By the end of the 1950s, Desilu had become a large company, causing a good deal of stress for both Ball and Arnaz; his increased drinking further compounded matters.{{citation needed|date=March 2012|reason=Previous ref <!--http://members.tripod.com/TropicanaNightclub/desihistory.html--> not a reliable source}}

On March 3, 1960, a day after Desi's forty-third birthday (and one day after the filming of Lucy and Desi's last episode together), Lucy filed papers in Santa Monica Superior Court, claiming married life to Desi was "a nightmare" and nothing at all like it appeared on ''I Love Lucy''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Bart`|title=Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel|year=1976|publisher=Clarke, Irwin & Company Limited|location=Toronto and Vancouver|page=166}}</ref>

On May 4, 1960, just two months after filming that episode (the final episode of ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''), the couple divorced. Until his death in 1986, however, Arnaz and Ball remained friends and often spoke very fondly of each other. Her real-life divorce indirectly found its way into her later television series, as she was always cast as an unmarried woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2003_09_25.html|title=Powell's Books&nbsp;– Review-a-Day&nbsp;– Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball by Stefan Kanfer|work=The New Republic Online|accessdate=April 5, 2008|quote=Ball's real life divorce makes it into her new shows as showing her as a single woman}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kanfer|2003|pp=72–84}}. "Ball and Arnaz remain friends".</ref>

The following year, Ball starred in the Broadway musical ''[[Wildcat (musical)|Wildcat]]'', which co-starred [[Keith Andes]] and [[Paula Stewart]]. That marked the beginning of a thirty-year friendship between Lucy and Stewart, who introduced Lucy to second husband [[Gary Morton]], a [[Borscht Belt]] comic who was thirteen years her junior.{{sfn|Sanders|Gilbert|1993|p=216}} According to Ball, Morton claimed he had never seen an episode of ''I Love Lucy'' due to his hectic work schedule.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=94}} Ball immediately installed Morton in her production company, teaching him the television business and eventually promoting him to producer. Morton played occasional bit parts on Ball's various series.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=103}}

Ball was outspoken against the relationship her son had with [[Liza Minnelli]]. Talking about Minnelli dating her son, she was quoted as saying, "I miss Liza, but you cannot domesticate Liza."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|pp=35–37}}

Ball's close friends in the business included perennial co-star [[Vivian Vance]] as well as film stars [[Ann Sothern]] and [[Ginger Rogers]], and comedic television performers [[Mary Wickes]] and [[Mary Jane Croft]]; all appeared at least once on her various series. Former Broadway co-stars Andes and Stewart also appeared at least once on her later sitcoms. Ball mentored actress and singer [[Carole Cook]], and befriended [[Barbara Eden]], when Eden appeared on an episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.

==Death==
On April 18, 1989, Ball was at her home in Beverly Hills when she complained of chest pains. An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the emergency room of [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]. She was diagnosed with [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]] and underwent [[heart surgery]] for nearly eight hours, receiving an aorta from a 27-year-old man who had died in a motorcycle accident. The surgery appeared to have been successful, and Ball began recovering very quickly, even walking around her room with little assistance. She received a flurry of get-well wishes from Hollywood, and across the street from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the [[Hard Rock Café]] erected a sign reading "Hard Rock Loves Lucy". However, shortly after dawn on April 26, Ball awoke with severe back pains and soon lost consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1187461.html|title=Article: Lucille Ball, Pioneer of Television Comedy, Dies at 77|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Ball Dies of Aorta Failure">{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Lucille|title=Ball dies of ruptured aorta|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-27/news/mn-1618_1_love-lucy-aorta-emergency-heart-surgery|publisher=L.A.
