'''''Jack's Big Music Show''''' is an American musical children's [[television program]] that aired on the [[Nick Jr. (TV channel)|Noggin]] (now called [[Nick Jr.]]) television network.  The show premiered on the network on November 7, 2004 after the first episode they did a 1-year hiatus till Fall of 2005. ''Jack's Big Music Show'' was nominated for a 2008 Emmy award for Outstanding Pre-school Television Series. 

According to Nick Jr.'s website:
:The mission of ''Jack’s Big Music Show'' is to expose and foster an appreciation of music. Music and musical instruments help children expand their universe and develop memory, language, literacy, and reasoning skills as well as the cognitive, social, and motor skills that are needed to excel in school.<ref>[http://www.noggin.com/parents/jacks_learningactiv.php Learning Goals and Activities] Noggin Website</ref>

The show was produced by Spiffy Pictures (led by David Rudman, Todd Hannert, and Adam Rudman).

The popularity of the show made the idea of appearing on it attractive to musicians. An executive from Noggin in 2006 said that they were "clamoring to get onto ''Jack's Big Music Show''."<ref>[http://www.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2006/06/24/kindie/index3.html Kindie Rock], Scott Lamb, [[Salon.com]], June 24, 2006</ref>

In May 2007, production was cancelled and it was announced that no new episodes would be produced with the last episode being aired on April 1, 2008.

==Influences==
In an interview on the Nick Jr. website, Rudman says that ''The Jack Benny Show'' was an influence on ''Jack's Big Music Show'' (along with ''[[The Little Rascals]]'').<ref>[http://www.nickjr.com/jacks-big-music-show/about-jacks-big-music-show/jacks-big-music-show-creators_ap.html Meet the Creators of ''Jack's Big Music Show''] Nick Jr. Website</ref> 

The names Jack, Mary, Mel, and the "Schwartzman Quartet" are references to characters on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' ([[Jack Benny]], [[Mary Livingstone]], [[Mel Blanc]], and the Sportsmen Quartet). Other possible name references to ''Jack Benny Program'' regulars include the squirrels Sheldon and Leonard ([[Sheldon Leonard]]), Phil the Coo-Coo Bird ([[Phil Harris]]), and Gertrude the Groundhog ([[Bea Benaderet]]'s recurring character Gertrude Gearshift).

The ring around Mel's eye is an obvious homage to [[Pete the Pup]] from ''The Little Rascals''.

Hannert says that the music is influenced by [[Chuck Berry]] and the whole history of [[rock and roll]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}
