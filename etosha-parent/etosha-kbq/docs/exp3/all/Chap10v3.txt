10. Lifecycle of Social Networks
Di↵erent Wikipedia projects grow di↵erently. This is not surprising, because they are maintained by di↵erent communities. Thus they are influenced by di↵erent economical, political and cultural conditions. Because each Wikipedia sub project is created in a di↵erent language, one can say, that each Wikipedia project represents a di↵erent cultural context wherein di↵erent topics are important. This view is based on di↵erences in how languages are used and how di↵erent cultural aspects are reflected within community driven large projects. Comment from Lev: (Hofsted’s Cultural dimensions) + citation of Axelrod’s model [? ] A second perspective exist. On a higher abstraction level, all Wikipedias can be unified, by ignoring the cultural
and lingual di↵erences. In this case one can say: Wikipedia is the global encyclopedia. It is a crowd based information storage and knowledge creation system. A growing system with inherent memory. For multiple languages, there exist several Wikipedia instances. All may have comparable properties. If a reasonable approach of normalization of the data exists, one could compare the project life cycles or phases. To verify this hypothesis we analyze the growth procedure of four Wikipedias. We selected English, Swedish,
Dutch, and Hebrew Wikipedias for this sub project. A preliminary report was also published by Schreck et al. [? ] http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1776v1.pdf.
10.1. Growth of Social Content Networks
The Wikipedia projects are more than just networks, to which a new node is added at a given time. Pages provide information, they innervate new ideas, lead to questions, and as a consequence, new pages are added by di↵erent people. The system is embedded in its user community which consists of editors and reader. Not all people contribute to Wikipedia, but a critical mass of users seams to be required by a Wikipedia project in order to survive. Because our social structures connect users and editors to each other in a transparent way, Wikipedia can be compared with a solid body which exist in a field of radiation. The incoming energy flow leads to an increase of internal energy and to heating. Until the body reaches an
equilibrium state. Now it can radiate as well. Explain Strahlungsgleichgewicht Energie wird in z.B. in Form von Strahlung in ein System bertragen. Die
E�zienz der bertragung hngt von vielen Faktoren ab.

Die Erhhung der Temperatur ist eine recht einfache Vorstellung, die Anregung von Rotationsmoden eine andere, mit einem komplizierteren Modell verbundene.

Ereignissen zhlen lsst, zur messbaren Strukturvernderung des Systems und zum Volumen Wachstum in Beziehung zu setzen ist. Gibt es Phasen, in denen der eine odere Anteil dominiert? Wie kann man solche Phasen erkennen?
10.2. New Approach: A Data Driven Adjustable Growth Model
According to section ?? the random graph model is used to create new links between existing nodes with an equal probability for all possible nodes. The model called preferential attachment connects new nodes to an existing network, based on the properties of the nodes (node degree) which are already available. Nodes with some neighbors have a higher chance to get new linked nodes, but nodes can also be added with out any link. This simple models are helpful but can not be used to describe the Wikipedia networks entirely because the neglect the change of internal state and structure. A new model is required. Inspired by the ”Strahlungsgleichgewicht” we use equation for the process of network
growth has to cover the creation of new nodes as well as the creation of new links. In the case of wikipedia we can count the number of edit events. But what is going on during such an edit event? New text can be added and the overall amount of data grows (see . ), new nodes are added and new links are added. All edit activity lead to one, two or all of the mentioned results. Finally it is also possible that no additional content is added but the internal structure is changed during editorial sessions.
�Isystem = Ilinkcreation + Inodecreation + Inodechanges + Ilinkchanges t aedit · vcontrib (10.1) While the creation of links and the creation of new pages is primary a structural change, the text creation or
content creation leads to more information within Wikipedia. Structural information also contains information.

This means, also the creation or reorganization of the network structure leads to more information. If a large page is just spilt into smaller but linked pages, it is much easier to retrieve information. Relations to other nodes in the network can be found automatically. Therfore the context or the meaning of a certain text has to be known. With such information, the wikipedia pages can be used like a semantic network. The link structure and the content within the neighborhood define context. A formal representation of Wikipedia data is available as a semantic graph, as provided by the DBPedia project [? ].
10.2.0.a. Dataset
Here we work with the data set from the German wikipedia, which is available via http://de.wikipedia.org. The rawdata was obtained from the list of all available links and all revisions. For each link the pageid of the source and the destination are stored together with the a timestamp which describes the link creation event. The time resolution is one second. For the analysis the data is aggregated to a time resolution of one hour. Based on this time series the nr of new created pages nN and the number of new created links lN per hour is
calculated for each selected wikipedia subproject (currently in progress: 60,68,109,222). Fig 1 show the both time series for the German wikipedia with hourly resolution and Fig. 2 shows the same data, but with a binning of 24, which gives the dayly data. If appropriate computational resources are available, one should measure the topological properties of the network
as a function of time. This can be done a global or a local scale. The global topology is calculated for the full graph, while a local topology takes only the local neighborhood around some pre selected nodes which represent the topic one is interested in well at much lower cost.

10.3. Results and Discussion
How can we describe the life cycle of Wikpedia? How can we characterize the growth of Wikipedia? What is the critical mass for editors?
Figure 10.3.: Access Rate Trends. Typical trends for changes in access volume of Swedish Wikipedia articles, for which an English version is created during the time frame of our study. Accumulated access volume per day is plotted versus time in days since 01.01.2009 as blue, red, and yellow symbols for three groups of articles with very large (N � 105, yellow), large (105 > N � 104, red), and intermediate (104 > N , blue) total access volume N . The continuous lines mark the average values, and the dashed lines are exponential fits. The drops in access frequency between days 150 and 240 are probably due to server problems with counting accesses. The strong variations disallow a reliable estimation of growth trends, since the access volume seems to be apparently decreasing in the considered time frame.
10.4. Comparison of Growth of Article Number and Article Quality
Several models are used to describe the growth process of networks. Two very popular network models are the random graph model and the scale free network. Both models describe how the internal structure evolves in time, based on the degree distribution. In the first case, one assumes that all nodes (pages) already exist, and the growth process consists of adding links, one in each time step. In the second case, one page is added in each time step. This means a new link and a new page are created at the same time. In a real network, like the Wikipedia content network, both processes of adding new pages and adding new
links between pages are coupled and cannot be separated from each other. In order to describe the growth of the Swedish Wikipedia project in more detail we analyze the growth rates for the number of pages and the number of links. Because we have several types of links we also compare the growth rates of the number of links for those types. Internal links are links within the same Wikipedia (same language) and redirects to another page of the same Wikipedia. Internal links represent semantic relations between the terms the pages are about or just relations between topics or concepts which are used within a certain page. If the meaning of a term is ambiguous, special pages help to show users all possible meanings (based on other pages). Such pages do not contribute much text, but this structural information is of a high value and increases the usability of Wikipedia. External links are links to another language (Interwiki links) and links to pages outside the Wikipedia project (e.g., references). The frequency of such links represents an important quality indicator for Wikipedia articles.
Chapter 10. Lifecycle of Social Networks 74
10.4.1. Evolution of the Degree Distribution
Figure 10.4.: Evolution of Degree Distribution. Degree distribution p(k) (i.e., distribution of the number k of links per page) for internal links in the Swedish Wikipedia project. One curve is shown for each month from January 2001 till December 2009.
All links contribute to the Wikipedia’s structure which evolves over time. The creation of a new link is a result of an edit activity of an user. Figure 15 shows the temporal evolution of the internal link degree distribution for all pages of the Swedish Wikipedia. Redirects and external links are disregarded in this plot. Already since the beginning in 2002 the degree distribution can be described by a power law, with the exception of pages with a very low degree (low number of links). While pages are added over time, the distribution changes and its power-law shape becomes more obvious, since the range of degrees becomes wider. Actually, most of the pages have much more than ten internal links and are well described by a power-law degree distribution. Only the number of pages with less than ten internal links is smaller than assumed in the scale-free model that predicts power-law degree distributions.
10.4.2. Growth of the Content Network and Structural Changes
Figure 16(a) shows the total number of pages for four Wikipedia projects (Swedish, English, Dutch, and Hebrew). The number of pages NP (t) is growing by the number of new pages nP (t) = NP (t)�NP (t� 1) per time interval �t = 1 month. Figure 16(b) shows the growth rate � for an exponential growth model NP (t) = NP (t� 1) exp(�), which has been determined by � ⇡ nP (t)/NP (t). Note that an increased �t has been used if nP (t) = 0. In the beginning the growth rate � is quite large. Later, a tendency towards saturation can be identified. This
shows that the character of edit events changed over time. In the early stage of a Wikipedia project most of the edit events are related to the creation of new pages, while later on the internal structure evolves. For the English Wikipedia project, one can see an intermediate regime with an exponential growth (� ⇡ 0.7). Such an exponential growth cannot be unambiguously identified for the Swedish Wikipedia. Interestingly, the page-growth rate has been drastically increasing during the last few months (in 2013) for the Dutch and – even more dramatically – for the Swedish Wikipedia. Acutally, the Swedish and the Dutch Wikipedia started to create articles using bots. Figure 17 confirms that editorial activity tends to focus more on the addition of links than the creation of new
pages during later states of Wikipedia evolution. It shows the ratio of the total number of pages NP (t) and the total number of links l(t) as function of time. For all languages this ratio decreases during most of the time after a relatively large value (around 0.2, i.e., approximately five links per article) in the beginning. The final values are between 0.015 and 0.04, i.e. at approximately 25-60 links per article. For the Dutch and the Swedish Wikipedia the initial change (between 2001 and 2003) is quite sudden. In general, all four languages show a stronger decay of the page number to link number ratio in the beginning and a much slower decay later on. This behavior suggests that an exponential decay model may also be appropriate. However, we cannot find any regimes with unique or approximately constant decay rates for any of the considered four languages. The di↵erent decay rates of the page number to link number ratio might also be indicators for two di↵erent network growth processes. The Swedish Wikipedia has initially ⇡ 5 links per page and later the number of links per page increases to an
average of ⇡ 25. This is in line with the change in the degree distribution, which is shown in Fig. 15. Here one can see a continuous shift towards a dominating structural growth process, while the growth of content volume – measured in number of pages – becomes less important. The current ratio of page number to link number for the Swedish Wikipedia is quite similar those for the English and the Dutch version, while the Hebrew Wikipedia has about twice as many links per article. During the quick growth of the Swedish Wikipedia article number in the past few months (see Figs. 16(a,b)), the article to link number ratio has slightly grown, which may indicate a slight change of the structure towards properties typical for Wikipedias at earlier stages of evolution. Although, this weak growth is still comparable with typical fluctuations of the ratio (just about twice as large), it may indicate that creating articles by bots leads to a step back in the quality of content.

Figure 10.5.: Comparison of Growth Rate for four languages. For the Wikipedia projects in Swedish (blue),
English (red), Dutch (yellow), and Hebrew (green) (a) the number of pages and (b) the exponential growth rate � is shown.
Next we separate the changes of internal and external link numbers. External links (to other language versions or references outside Wikipedia) are particularly important for confirmation of the article content and can thus be regarded as an important quality indicator for the articles. Figure 18 shows the ratio of the number of external links to the number of all links (internal and external). The increasing curves show, that the ratio of external links grows for most of the time in all four Wikipedias. We note that there are two major groups of external links: just ’further reading’ links (often in bad articles) and references (more likely in good articles). The habit of adding references increased in the last years, while one got more discouraged adding just simple links; they are usually also limited to 3-5 per article.
In Fig. 18 one can also find indicators for two regimes for each Wikipedia project except the English: fast growth from approximately 2003 to 2005 followed by a behavior close to saturation after 2005. Table 2 shows the times where the qualitative behavior changes. The transition time A (tA) is determined from Figure 17, which shows the ratio of total number of pages and total number of links while the transition time C (tC) is based on the plot in Figure 18, which shows the ratio of external and internal links. For all languages we find that tA is before tC , but the di↵erences vary from 4 to 52 months depending on the languages.

Note that only Swedish data is available till present and that the vertical axis has a logarithmic scale.

The Swedish Wikipedia has already reached the largest ratio of external links among all links in 2010 and has continued to increase this ratio during the last 2.5 years (see Fig. 18). This is an indication for a very good reference quality of average articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, better than in the Dutch Wikipedia. Note that the ratio of external links is very much lower in the English Wikipedia, just approximately half as large as in the Swedish Wikipedia (data from 2010). The slight drop of the Swedish curve in Fig. 18 in the last months is probably associated with the drastic increase of the total number of articles (see Fig. 16). However, it is too weak to be considered as an indication of a drop in article reference quality, and there was a significant larger increase during 2012 just before the slight drop. We note that bot generated articles usually have a quite high density of references, meaning just one sentence but 2-3 references to publications which, however, may not be linked using a web link. Overall, we can conclude that the article reference quality of the Swedish Wikipedia has not decreased significantly in the past months despite the quite drastic content increase with nearly doubled article number probably due to article creation by bots.

10.4.3. Attachement Probability
A link is created to a node with degree k=x. For all link creation events we count the number of nodes with degree k within a given range kmin...kmax to draw a histogram which shows the distribution function of the attachment probability. We have to compare this result with the theoretical distribution used in in the BA-Model ... Link creation in the presence of edit-activity and access-activity has to be studied if the model should be modified
for per link creation predictions. So far we investigated the system properties only. But for a prediction of a probability for link creation between
two nodes, a separate approach is required. For a given time, one wants to calculate a link creation probability for a selected node pair. Therefore the following data is taken into account: the short term history of both nodes regarding edit and access activity. The large amount of Wikipedia data allows application of a machine learning algorithms such as decision trees
and rule-based models for classification. But one has to be careful. Because the system is not stationary, the models may not behave well unless they are
trained with data from within the same phase. Here we investigate data from one regime only. A detailed study of the impact of non stationary conditions has to be investigated in a separate project. Here we consider the logistic regression to classify the event under consideration as one of type A, which means,
a link is probably created within the next time window or of type B, which means, no link will be created. Other properties, such as correlation between time series, existence of peaks in both series can be used as additional features which may have an influence on the quality of the model. More work is required here ...
Further research (maybe later on) ...
10.4.4. Phases and Phase Transitions
We distinguish di↵erent phases in a less restricted way, compared to the clear definition of a phase transition in physics. If a particular property is dominating, we consider this a phase in the life cycle of the system. A more precise term could be regime. More research on more data is required before real phase transitions can be propagated. Figure ... shows quite stable growth rates within several time ranges. Even a negative growth rate could be
measured, this is a clear indicator for internal structural changes. Can we di↵erentiate between phases with more change in content from such with more structural changes?

Several models are used to describe the growth process of networks. Two very popular network models are the random graph model and the scale free network. Both models describe how the internal structure evolves in time, based on the degree distribution. In the first case, one assumes that all nodes (pages) already exist, and the growth process consists of adding links, one in each time step. In the second case, one page is added in each time step. This means a new link and a new page are created at the same time. In a real network, like the Wikipedia content network, both processes of adding new pages and adding new
links between pages are coupled and cannot be separated from each other. In order to describe the growth of the Swedish Wikipedia project in more detail we analyze the growth rates for the number of pages and the number of links. Because we have several types of links we also compare the growth rates of the number of links for those types. Internal links are links within the same Wikipedia (same language) and redirects to another page of the same Wikipedia. Internal links represent semantic relations between the terms the pages are about or just relations between topics or concepts which are used within a certain page. If the meaning of a term is ambiguous, special pages help to show users all possible meanings (based on other pages). Such pages do not contribute much text, but this structural information is of a high value and increases the usability of Wikipedia. External links are links to another language (Interwiki links) and links to pages outside the Wikipedia project (e.g., references). The frequency of such links represents an important quality indicator for Wikipedia articles.

All links contribute to the Wikipedia’s structure which evolves over time. The creation of a new link is a result of an edit activity of an user. Figure 15 shows the temporal evolution of the internal link degree distribution for all pages of the Swedish Wikipedia. Redirects and external links are disregarded in this plot. Already since the beginning in 2002 the degree distribution can be described by a power law, with the exception of pages with a very low degree (low number of links). While pages are added over time, the distribution changes and its power-law shape becomes more obvious, since the range of degrees becomes wider. Actually, most of the pages have much more than ten internal links and are well described by a power-law degree distribution. Only the number of pages with less than ten internal links is smaller than assumed in the scale-free model that predicts power-law degree distributions.
10.4.2. Growth of the Content Network and Structural Changes
Figure 16(a) shows the total number of pages for four Wikipedia projects (Swedish, English, Dutch, and Hebrew). The number of pages NP (t) is growing by the number of new pages nP (t) = NP (t)�NP (t� 1) per time interval �t = 1 month. Figure 16(b) shows the growth rate � for an exponential growth model NP (t) = NP (t� 1) exp(�), which has been determined by � ⇡ nP (t)/NP (t). Note that an increased �t has been used if nP (t) = 0. In the beginning the growth rate � is quite large. Later, a tendency towards saturation can be identified. This
shows that the character of edit events changed over time. In the early stage of a Wikipedia project most of the edit events are related to the creation of new pages, while later on the internal structure evolves. For the English Wikipedia project, one can see an intermediate regime with an exponential growth (� ⇡ 0.7). Such an exponential growth cannot be unambiguously identified for the Swedish Wikipedia. Interestingly, the page-growth rate has been drastically increasing during the last few months (in 2013) for the Dutch and – even more dramatically – for the Swedish Wikipedia. Acutally, the Swedish and the Dutch Wikipedia started to create articles using bots. Figure 17 confirms that editorial activity tends to focus more on the addition of links than the creation of new
pages during later states of Wikipedia evolution. It shows the ratio of the total number of pages NP (t) and the total number of links l(t) as function of time. For all languages this ratio decreases during most of the time after a relatively large value (around 0.2, i.e., approximately five links per article) in the beginning. The final values are between 0.015 and 0.04, i.e. at approximately 25-60 links per article. For the Dutch and the Swedish Wikipedia the initial change (between 2001 and 2003) is quite sudden. In general, all four languages show a stronger decay of the page number to link number ratio in the beginning and a much slower decay later on. This behavior suggests that an exponential decay model may also be appropriate. However, we cannot find any regimes with unique or approximately constant decay rates for any of the considered four languages. The di↵erent decay rates of the page number to link number ratio might also be indicators for two di↵erent network growth processes. The Swedish Wikipedia has initially ⇡ 5 links per page and later the number of links per page increases to an
average of ⇡ 25. This is in line with the change in the degree distribution, which is shown in Fig. 15. Here one can see a continuous shift towards a dominating structural growth process, while the growth of content volume – measured in number of pages – becomes less important. The current ratio of page number to link number for the Swedish Wikipedia is quite similar those for the English and the Dutch version, while the Hebrew Wikipedia has about twice as many links per article. During the quick growth of the Swedish Wikipedia article number in the past few months (see Figs. 16(a,b)), the article to link number ratio has slightly grown, which may indicate a slight change of the structure towards properties typical for Wikipedias at earlier stages of evolution. Although, this weak growth is still comparable with typical fluctuations of the ratio (just about twice as large), it may indicate that creating articles by bots leads to a step back in the quality of content.

English (red), Dutch (yellow), and Hebrew (green) (a) the number of pages and (b) the exponential growth rate � is shown.
Next we separate the changes of internal and external link numbers. External links (to other language versions or references outside Wikipedia) are particularly important for confirmation of the article content and can thus be regarded as an important quality indicator for the articles. Figure 18 shows the ratio of the number of external links to the number of all links (internal and external). The increasing curves show, that the ratio of external links grows for most of the time in all four Wikipedias. We note that there are two major groups of external links: just ’further reading’ links (often in bad articles) and references (more likely in good articles). The habit of adding references increased in the last years, while one got more discouraged adding just simple links; they are usually also limited to 3-5 per article.
In Fig. 18 one can also find indicators for two regimes for each Wikipedia project except the English: fast growth from approximately 2003 to 2005 followed by a behavior close to saturation after 2005. Table 2 shows the times where the qualitative behavior changes. The transition time A (tA) is determined from Figure 17, which shows the ratio of total number of pages and total number of links while the transition time C (tC) is based on the plot in Figure 18, which shows the ratio of external and internal links. For all languages we find that tA is before tC , but the di↵erences vary from 4 to 52 months depending on the languages.

The Swedish Wikipedia has already reached the largest ratio of external links among all links in 2010 and has continued to increase this ratio during the last 2.5 years (see Fig. 18). This is an indication for a very good reference quality of average articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, better than in the Dutch Wikipedia. Note that the ratio of external links is very much lower in the English Wikipedia, just approximately half as large as in the Swedish Wikipedia (data from 2010). The slight drop of the Swedish curve in Fig. 18 in the last months is probably associated with the drastic increase of the total number of articles (see Fig. 16). However, it is too weak to be considered as an indication of a drop in article reference quality, and there was a significant larger increase during 2012 just before the slight drop. We note that bot generated articles usually have a quite high density of references, meaning just one sentence but 2-3 references to publications which, however, may not be linked using a web link. Overall, we can conclude that the article reference quality of the Swedish Wikipedia has not decreased significantly in the past months despite the quite drastic content increase with nearly doubled article number probably due to article creation by bots.

10.4.3. Attachement Probability
A link is created to a node with degree k=x. For all link creation events we count the number of nodes with degree k within a given range kmin...kmax to draw a histogram which shows the distribution function of the attachment probability. We have to compare this result with the theoretical distribution used in in the BA-Model ... Link creation in the presence of edit-activity and access-activity has to be studied if the model should be modified
for per link creation predictions. So far we investigated the system properties only. But for a prediction of a probability for link creation between
two nodes, a separate approach is required. For a given time, one wants to calculate a link creation probability for a selected node pair. Therefore the following data is taken into account: the short term history of both nodes regarding edit and access activity. The large amount of Wikipedia data allows application of a machine learning algorithms such as decision trees
and rule-based models for classification. But one has to be careful. Because the system is not stationary, the models may not behave well unless they are
trained with data from within the same phase. Here we investigate data from one regime only. A detailed study of the impact of non stationary conditions has to be investigated in a separate project. Here we consider the logistic regression to classify the event under consideration as one of type A, which means,
a link is probably created within the next time window or of type B, which means, no link will be created. Other properties, such as correlation between time series, existence of peaks in both series can be used as additional features which may have an influence on the quality of the model. More work is required here ...
Further research (maybe later on) ...
10.4.4. Phases and Phase Transitions
We distinguish di↵erent phases in a less restricted way, compared to the clear definition of a phase transition in physics. If a particular property is dominating, we consider this a phase in the life cycle of the system. A more precise term could be regime. More research on more data is required before real phase transitions can be propagated. Figure ... shows quite stable growth rates within several time ranges. Even a negative growth rate could be
measured, this is a clear indicator for internal structural changes. Can we di↵erentiate between phases with more change in content from such with more structural changes?
