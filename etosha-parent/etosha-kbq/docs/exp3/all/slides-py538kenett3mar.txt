The choice of the proper network representation determines our ability to use network theory successfully. ! In some cases there is a unique, unambiguous representation. In other cases, the representation is by no means unique. ! For example,, the way we assign the links between a group of individuals will determine the nature of the question we can study.

Factor models are simple and widespread model of multivariate time series! A general multifactor model for N variables xi(t) is
is a constant describing the weight of factor j in explaining the dynamics of the variable xi(t).! The number of factors is K and they are described by the time series fj(t). is a (Gaussian) zero mean noise with unit variance
Factor models
Factor models: examples
Multifactor models have been introduced to model a set of asset prices, generalizing CAPM! ! ! ! where now B is a (NxK) matrix and f(t) is a (Kx1) vector of factors. ! ! The factors can be selected either on a theoretical ground (e.g. interest rates for bonds, inflation, industrial production growth, oil price, etc.) or on a statistical ground (i.e. by applying factor analysis methods, etc.)! ! Examples of multifactor models are Arbitrage Pricing Theory (Ross 1976) and the Intertemporal CAPM (Merton 1973).
