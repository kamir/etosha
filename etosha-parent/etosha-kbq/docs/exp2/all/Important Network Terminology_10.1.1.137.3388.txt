Exponential random graph models, also known as p* models, constitute a family of
statistical models for social networks. The importance of this modeling framework lies in
its capacity to represent social structural effects commonly observed in many human
social networks, including general degree-based effects as well as reciprocity and
transitivity, and at the node-level, homophily and attribute-based activity and popularity
effects. The models can be derived from explicit hypotheses about dependencies among
network ties. They are parameterized in terms of the prevalence of small subgraphs
(configurations) in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of
local social processes from which a given network emerges. The models are estimable
from data and readily simulated. Versions of the models have been proposed for
univariate and multivariate networks, valued networks, bipartite graphs and for
longitudinal network data. Nodal attribute data can be incorporated in social selection
models, and through an analogous framework for social influence models.
