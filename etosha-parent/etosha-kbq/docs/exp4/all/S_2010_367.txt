Letter dated 6 July 2010 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council
I have the honour to refer to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), established on 30 November 1999 pursuant to Security Council resolution 1279 (1999), which, as of 1 July 2010, bears the title United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Following the usual consultations, I should like to inform you of my intention to appoint Lieutenant General Chander Prakash (India) as Force Commander of MONUSCO. Lieutenant General Prakash will replace Lieutenant General Babacar Gaye (Senegal), who will complete his tour of duty with the Mission on 31 July 2010. I should like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to Lieutenant General Gaye, whose dedication to duty and effective leadership of the Missionâ€™s military component, during a crucial period of time, have allowed MONUC/MONUSCO to make important progress towards the return of peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council.
