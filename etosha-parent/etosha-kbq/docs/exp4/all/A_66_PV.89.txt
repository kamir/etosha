Reports of the Third Committee
The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): The General Assembly will consider the reports of the Third Committee on agenda items 27, 28, 62, 64 to 69, 107, 108, 121 and 135.
I now request the Rapporteur of the Third Committee, Miss Kadra Ahmed Hassan of Djibouti, to introduce the reports of the Committee in one intervention.
Miss Hassan (Djibouti), Rapporteur of the Third Committee (VSRNH� LQ�)UHQFK): It is a great honour and privilege for me to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the Third Committee submitted under the agenda items allocated to it by the Assembly: items 27, 28, 62, 64 to 69, 107, 108, 121 and 135.
The reports, contained in documents A/66/454 to A/66/466, include the texts of draft resolutions and decisions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption. For the convenience of delegations, the Secretariat has issued document A/C.3/66/INF/1*, which contains a checklist of action taken on the draft proposals contained in the reports before the Assembly.
Under agenda item 27, entitled “Social development”, including its sub-items (a), (b) and (c), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 35 of document A/66/454 (Part II), the adoption of seven draft resolutions and, in paragraph 36, the adoption of one draft decision.
I call the Assembly’s attention to a minor error in the English version of the report. The following countries, which were inadvertently omitted and whose names were read out by the principal sponsors, should be added to the list contained in paragraph 9 on page 7: Austria, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Philippines, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Thailand and Ukraine.
The Assembly will also recall that, at its 73rd plenary meeting, on 5 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 66/67, entitled “Tenth anniversary of the International Year of Volunteers”, which was recommended by the Third Committee in document A/66/454 (Part I).
Under agenda item 28, entitled “Advancement of women”, including its sub-items (a) and (b), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 26 of document A/66/455, the adoption of five draft resolutions and, in paragraph 27, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under agenda item 62, entitled “Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, questions relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 13 of document A/66/456, the adoption of three draft resolutions.
Under agenda item 64, entitled “Report of the Human Rights Council”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 20 of document A/66/457, the adoption of three draft resolutions and, in paragraph 21, the adoption of one draft decision.
2 11-64365
document A/66/462/Add.1, the adoption of four draft resolutions.
It is my understanding that the Assembly will defer its consideration of draft resolution IV, entitled “Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto” until such time as it has before it the relevant report of the Fifth Committee.
Under sub-item (b) of agenda item 69, entitled “Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 108 of document A/66/462/Add.2, the adoption of 23 draft resolutions.
Under sub-item (c) of agenda item 69, entitled “Human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 33 of document A/66/462/ Add.3, the adoption of four draft resolutions.
It is my understanding that the Assembly will defer its consideration of draft resolution II, entitled “Situation of human rights in Myanmar”, until such time as it has before it the relevant report of the Fifth Committee.
Under sub-item (d) of agenda item 69, entitled “Comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action”, the Third Committee advises the Assembly, in document A/66/462/Add.4, that no action was required under the sub-item.
Under agenda item 107, entitled “Crime prevention and criminal justice”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 25 of document A/66/463, the adoption of six draft resolutions and, in paragraph 26, the adoption of one draft decision. Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolutions I and II, as contained in the report, it will not need to adopt draft resolutions I and II contained in the report under agenda item 108, entitled “International drug control”, as the texts in the two reports before the Assembly are identical.
I wish to point out that in paragraph 18 on page 11 of the English version of the report, the name of Switzerland should be deleted from the list of sponsors.
Under agenda item 108, entitled “International drug control”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 16 of document A/66/464, the adoption of
I should point out that on page 6 of the English version of the report, the draft resolution entitled “United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training”, should be designated as draft resolution II, not draft resolution III.
Under agenda item 65, entitled “Promotion and protection of the rights of children”, including its sub-items (a) and (b), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 32 of document A/66/458, the adoption of three draft resolutions and, in paragraph 33, the adoption of a draft decision.
I would like to make a minor correction to the English version of draft resolution I, entitled “Strengthening collaboration on child protection within the United Nations system”. Paragraph 2 should read as follows:
“Reiterates the importance of all relevant actors of the United Nations on child protection to continue to exercise their functions in a fully independent manner and to act in full observance of their respective mandates;”
The corrected version of the report, contained in document A/66/458*, has been published in the Official Document System.
Under agenda item 66, entitled “Rights of indigenous peoples”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 11 of document A/66/459, the adoption of one draft resolution.
Under agenda item 67, entitled “Elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance”, including its sub-items (a) and (b), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 17 of document A/66/460, the adoption of two draft resolutions and, in paragraph 18, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under agenda item 68, entitled “Right of peoples to self-determination”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 19 of document A/66/461, the adoption of three draft resolutions and, in paragraph 20, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under agenda item 69, entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 5 of document A/66/462, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under sub-item (a) of agenda item 69, entitled “Implementation of human rights instruments”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 22 of
11-64365 3
A/66/PV.89
“When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”
May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance. This means that where recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Committee.
Before proceeding, I would like to draw the attention of members to a note by the Secretariat, entitled “List of proposals contained in the reports of the Third Committee”, which has been circulated, in English only, as document A/C.3/66/INF/1*. That note has been distributed desk-to-desk as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the Committee in its reports.
In that connection, members will find in the third column of the note the numbers of the draft resolutions or decisions of the Committee, with the corresponding symbols of the reports for action in the plenary in the second column of the same note.
Furthermore, Members are reminded that additional sponsors are no longer accepted now that draft resolutions and decisions have been adopted by the Committee. Any clarification about sponsorship should be addressed to the Secretary of the Third Committee.
Agenda item 27 (FRQWLQXHG)

draft resolution III only, since draft resolutions I and II are already contained in document A/66/463.
Under agenda item 121, entitled “Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 6 of document A/66/465*, the adoption of one draft decision.
Lastly, under agenda item 135, entitled “Programme planning”, the Third Committee advises the Assembly, in document A/66/466, that no action was required under the agenda item.
I would like to thank my fellow Bureau members, in particular the Chair of the Committee, Ambassador Hussein Haniff, and Vice-Chairs Donnette Critchlow, Carolina Popovici and Luca Zelioli, as well as the Secretary of the Committee, Otto Gustafik, for their support and friendship in making this session efficient and ensuring its timely conclusion.
I respectfully commend the reports of the Third Committee to the plenary of the General Assembly for its consideration.

I would like to wish you, Mr. President, the Bureau members, the Secretariat and my colleagues all the pleasures of the holidays, with warmth and blessed peace.

The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): I thank the Rapporteur of the Third Committee.
If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Third Committee that are before the Assembly today.

Mr. Bené (Holy See): On the adoption this morning of resolution 66/126 on the preparations for and observance of the twentieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family, my delegation takes this opportunity to affirm the central role of the family in the life of every human person, community and society.
Affirmed in international instruments, the family, founded on the marriage of one man and one woman, is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State. In the preparations for and observance of the twentieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family, my delegation affirms the importance of Governments working together to support the family.

The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 28 and its sub-items (a) and (b)?
With the family institution increasingly under attack in many societies, my delegation reaffirms the indispensible role of the family, bearing in mind the different cultural, political and social realities in which the family exists. Each family is called to be a living cell of society, a wellspring of virtues, a school of constructive and peaceful coexistence, an instrument of harmony and a privileged environment in which human life is welcomed and protected, joyfully and responsibly, from its beginning until its natural end. In that regard, my delegation takes the opportunity to point out the role of parents, and in particular their primary responsibility, prior to the State, for the upbringing and development of their children.
Finally, resolution 66/126 rightly encourages Member States to adopt holistic approaches to policies and programmes that address family poverty, social exclusion and work/family balance and that share good practices in those areas.
I take this opportunity to express gratitude for the support that resolution 66/126 gives to the family.

I give the f loor to the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania in explanation of vote before the voting.
Ms. Maduhu (United Republic of Tanzania): I take the f loor today to speak on behalf of the members of the Group of African States on draft resolution I, entitled “Report of the Human Rights Council”. For the African Group, the draft resolution is in conformity, from the procedural aspect, with the status of the Human Rights Council as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, and whereby the Third Committee is the Main Committee of the Assembly responsible for the consideration of human rights issues, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 65/291 on the review of the Human Rights Council. Thus, all recommendations of the Council, including its decisions and resolutions, should be considered by the Third Committee.
The Group has presented the aforementioned draft resolution despite the fact that it observes with deep concern that the work of the Council has recently become more politicized and selective. The Group is alarmed at the adoption by the Council of several resolutions, including one on an undefined notion that has no legal foundation in international law. The Group reaffirms that fundamental freedoms and human rights are universally recognized and should be enjoyed by all human beings without discrimination on the basis of their humanity, without regard to any particular individual conduct or sexual preference.
The Group is also alarmed at the systematic attempts to misinterpret the Universal Declaration and international treaties to include undefined notions. The Group regrets that the Council continues to adopt a confrontational rather than a cooperative and consensus-building approach in its work, resulting in an increasing number of resolutions being adopted by voting. These include recommendations that are of utmost important to the Group, inter alia, concerning trafficking in persons, access to medicine in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, combating contemporary forms of slavery, the right to development, and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms through a better understanding of traditional values of humankind, among others.

As my delegation has stated in other forums, no international consensus exists regarding the terms of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity”, which are ill-defined terms that are open to various forms of subjective interpretation. For that reason, their inclusion under the category of “Other status” in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights would be inappropriate and, in any event, unnecessary in the case of rights afforded to all human beings.
The attempt to create novel categories of non-discrimination ex post facto and read them into the Covenants themselves exceeds the competence of the treaty-monitoring bodies and would undermine the reasons why States ratified such treaties. Furthermore, principles enunciated by experts have no binding authorities, save those which are consonant with internationally agreed human rights law.

would like to reaffirm that the rationale behind creating the Universal Periodic Review was to ensure universality and non-selectivity in the work of the Human Rights Council, the real performance of which, in a logical setting, would allow the United Nations human rights machinery to act beyond the monopoly of a few Member States. However, it is deplorable that, despite the existence of the mechanism of the Universal Periodic Review in the Human Rights Council, certain countries still continue to bring country-specific resolutions before both the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly to meet their political purposes.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has always manifested its sincere commitment to the promotion of human rights at the national, regional and international levels. Our unwavering commitment and corresponding efforts and activities on the promotion of human rights emanate from our religious obligation and the provisions of our Constitution, as well as from the international treaties to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party. Accordingly, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is fully cooperating with the United Nations mechanism on human rights.
On 17 and 18 October, the third periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was considered by the Human Rights Committee with the active and constructive participation of a high-ranking delegation dispatched from Iran. My country is also an active party to many of the core international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
In that regard, Iran submitted a third periodic report on the basis of article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and defended that report on 17 and 18 October during the 103rd session of the Human Rights Committee in Geneva. The second periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran within the framework of the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was also submitted to the relevant committee. Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran has submitted and defended two reports, and is in the final stage of preparing its

Report of the Third Committee (A/66/462/Add.3)
The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): The Assembly has before it four draft resolutions recommended by the Third Committee in paragraph 33 of its report. Before proceeding further, I should like to inform members that action on draft resolution II, entitled “Situation of human rights in Myanmar”, is postponed to a later date to allow time for the review of its programme budget implications by the Fifth Committee. The Assembly will take action on draft resolution II as soon as the report of the Fifth Committee on its programme budget implications is available.
I now give the f loor to those representatives wishing to speak in explanation of vote before the voting.
Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the outset, let me thank you, Sir, for providing me with this opportunity to reiterate in brief the position of my delegation with regard to draft resolution III, entitled “Human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran”.
Building on the invaluable lessons learned from the shortcomings of the former Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council has inspired new hopes and desires for sound and decent solutions to the maladies of the Commission, in particular regarding its selective approach towards the human rights situations in different countries. Likewise, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers the Human Rights Council to be a focal point for all Governments to address global human rights challenges devoid of politicization, selectivity, double standards and confrontation.
While reiterating our grave dissatisfaction with the emerging concerted efforts to force the Council back onto the path of the former Commission, my delegation
11-64365 19

A/66/462/Add.3, under agenda item 69, “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
No one can ignore, and members know full well, that the international legal framework within which Member States function is based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a country on any pretext whatsoever. That principle has been enshrined in many international instruments, notably in Article 2.7 of the Charter of the United Nations, and in many relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
Firmly convinced of the importance of protecting and promoting human rights, we are highly surprised by the claims of the main proponents of draft resolution IV. The authors of the text, who claim to promote and protect human rights in Syria, have voted against the promotion and protection of the rights of Syrian civilians living under Israeli occupation in the Syrian Golan. Furthermore, those same States have voted against many resolutions on the just and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The authors of the draft resolution exploit human rights issues to conspire against the sovereignty, stability, independence and territorial integrity of certain Member States.
The draft resolution before us today is simply one effort among many on the part of some authors — I do not say all, but some — that are participating in the political, media and diplomatic war against my country, Syria, in an attempt to create an environment conducive to the implementation of their plan to fragment the people of our region along communitarian, ethnic, religious and sectarian lines to justify the application of the Israeli theory of the Judaism of the State of Israel, which is being promoted by the United States and the principal sponsors of the draft resolution against Syria. That is being done to the detriment of the national, legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, which have been recognized hundreds of times by the United Nations over the decades.
The most striking proof of that f lagrant political hypocrisy, duplicity and manoeuvring is the fallacious claim by the authors of the draft, whose own States have imposed economic sanctions on Syria, its media — and on one daily newspaper in particular — and on our public and private television channels. Why? The answer is clear — that newspaper and those television channels are systematically broadcasting the confessions of terrorist groups and elements belonging to armed groups about foreign arms transfers across the internationally
third and fourth reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
I would like to reiterate the position of my Government that if Canada is really concerned about the human rights situation, it is certainly on the wrong track. While saying that, we do not mean to counter those unsubstantiated allegations by accusing our accusers in return or by reminding members of the concerns raised by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and about the situation of minority groups in that country. We by no means intend to say that, nor do we seek to refer to the serious concerns expressed by the independent expert on minority issues to the Human Rights Council over the use of racial profiling as a systematic practice and the excessive use of force leading to death, particularly with respect to young black males.
Nor do we intend to refer to the human rights situation in the United States, even in recent months; or to that country’s reaction to the so-called peaceful protests around the country; to the reports by reliable sources in 2011 regarding the continued use of excessive force and cruel prison conditions, including indefinite military detention, in Guantanamo; or to the devastating situation of detainees in the United States detention facility on the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and in secret United States detention centres around the world.
My delegation believes that the right track resides in the sincere willingness and determination of the countries involved to work together and to create a favourable environment based upon common understanding and respect for the promotion of the human rights situation at any level. It is the strong belief of my country that naming and shaming tactics, the adoption of country-specific resolutions and the manipulation of United Nations human rights mechanisms will not lead us towards mutually acceptable results that will benefit the promotion of human rights.
Finally, in proposing a motion of no-action on draft resolution III, my delegation would like to request all delegations to consider the politicized nature of this move. We urge them to vote in favour of the motion and to reject such attempts to save the credibility and integrity of the United Nations human rights mechanism.
Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): I would like to thank you, Sir, for giving me the f loor. I wish to convey the position of my country regarding draft resolution IV contained in document
20 11-64365
A/66/PV.89
behest of outside agendas to provoke communitarian, sectarian and factional war in Syria and to destabilize and destroy the well-known coexistence in my country.
The documents include confessions by elements of those armed groups about crimes involving arms transfers from certain neighbouring countries of Syria. We have also regularly provided the Secretary-General and members of the Security Council with quasi-periodic information concerning Syrian reforms that are currently under way. Unfortunately, despite all this transparency, none of that information appears in the draft resolution against Syria, which treats the issue in a one-sided manner.
In another attempt by certain of the draft resolution’s authors to destroy Syria through foreign military intervention using civilian protection as a pretext, the Security Council recently heard a briefing from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who presented the human rights situation in Syria in a sentimental, subjective, politicized and unprofessional way in an effort to tell certain countries what they expected to hear.
During the briefing, the High Commissioner laid full blame for the events in Syria on the Syrian Government. Going beyond her mandate and the mandate of her Office, she went so far as to call for the transfer of the Syrian issue to the International Criminal Court. At the same time, however, she closed her eyes to the human rights violations committed by armed terrorist groups and to the billions of dollars that have been provided to those groups in the form of money, weapons, media and logistical support to destabilize Syria, destroy its people and force it to change its national and independent political options.
Syria has affirmed and reaffirms today that the only solution to the current crisis is to support total and inclusive national dialogue and reform, meet the legitimate aspirations of our people, and conduct an honest investigation into the events taking place. We call on States Members of the United Nations to support necessary reforms that reflect the demands of our people and an inclusive Syrian national dialogue, and to abstain from considering politicized and unprofessional reports that harm the credibility and integrity of the United Nations.
We wish to ask a number of questions. Where were the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council when Israel violated
recognized borders of Syria from certain neighbouring countries. Those armed elements are receiving funds and advanced communications technologies from those neighbours, who are encouraging them to commit acts of terrorism. We have also heard terrible confessions of assassination, rape and mutilation being perpetrated by those same elements against civilian and military victims, along with the destruction of private and public property.
Can the authors of the draft resolution explain to us the link between the promotion and protection of human rights in Syria, on the one hand, and the bombings of gas pipelines, trains and railways; the explosion at an oil refinery in Homs; the murder of some military pilots; and attacks on civilians when they go to school or evade the occupation through civil disobedience, on the other?
My country is indignant about that selective approach and about the ongoing deception and political pressure. We are all the more so because the main authors of the draft resolution have a black history on human rights. Indeed, certain European countries and the United States of America continue to harass sovereign countries, threaten the peoples of the developing world, impose unilateral economic sanctions, and deprive their populations of the right to life, development and peace.
Furthermore, how can certain other countries that have co-sponsored this draft resolution claim to defend human rights in Syria when their own authorities are depriving their own people of the most basic human rights, including the right to elections, the rights of women and minorities, the rights of foreign nationals, and freedom of worship? Let us not forget that those same countries do not even have constitutions that guarantee democratic parliamentary rights, multi-party systems or alternation of authority.
On behalf of my country, we have submitted to the Secretary-General, the President of the Security Council, the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Executive Director of UNICEF and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict fully documented information on the confessions that have been made by armed terrorist elements, through audio and visual recordings, confirming their involvement in the killing of civilians and military personnel. Those confessions also reveal acts of mutilation and vandalism committed at the
11-64365 21
A/66/PV.89
Despite that signal, the crackdown by Syrian security forces against peaceful protesters and civilians has continued unabated. According to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, reliable information indicates ongoing systematic attacks on civilians, including a shoot-to-kill policy by Syrian security forces, thousands of arbitrary arrests and the widespread use of torture in Syrian detention centres.
The number of people killed since the protests in Syria began earlier this year now probably exceeds 5,000, including many children, as attested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Pillay. Despite the repeated calls of the international community, the Syrian authorities continue to refuse access to the commission of inquiry mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council and have so far have failed to implement the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States.
The draft resolution before us is a unique and ad hoc response to the dramatic events taking place on the ground in the Syrian Arab Republic as we speak. Over the past weekend alone, more than 20 dead were added to the sad and long list of victims.
The draft resolution enjoys substantial support from Member States in the Arab region. It underlines the courageous initiative of the League of Arab States to address the situation in Syria and calls for full implementation of its Plan of Action by the Syrian authorities in its entirety and without delay. That is the call of the draft resolution. It supports the voice of the Arab region. Let me emphasize that the draft resolution before the Assembly does not establish any new mechanism as such.
The human rights situation in Syria continues to deteriorate. It is time for the General Assembly, as the main and universal body of the United Nations, to reinforce the clear message of its Third Committee and call on the Syrian authorities to immediately stop human rights violations and the violence against its own population. The General Assembly should also urge the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with the United Nations and with the League of Arab States. My delegation will therefore vote in favour of draft resolution IV and calls on all Member States to do likewise.
The President (VSRNH�LQ�$UDELF): We will now take decisions on draft resolutions I, III and IV, one by one.
and continues to violate the human rights of people in the occupied Syrian Golan, a part of Syria that is dear to us and whose inhabitants have for four decades been targeted by systematic and grave human rights violations? For four decades, the Security Council has been unable to carry out its duty due to the position of certain influential hegemonic countries that support Israel and its aggressive expansionist policies.
What is the link between the promotion and protection of human rights in Syria and the frenetic attempts of certain sponsors of the draft resolution to propagate extreme Salafist Wahhabi thought in Syria, with its inevitable attacks on the admirable example of coexistence that has prevailed among the different components of the Syrian people for thousands of years? Why are groups accused of belonging to the Salafi school of thought held in Western prisons, such as Guantanamo, on the one hand, while the same extremist sectarian Salafi groups are allowed to become active in Syria and certain other countries of the region, on the other? Those are questions that we lay before the States Members of the United Nations.
In the light of the foregoing, my country calls for a recorded vote on draft resolution IV and, in order to preserve the dignity and credibility of the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations, I call on all Member States to vote against it. I hope that each and every one of us here will understand that encouraging the diabolical union between petrodollars, on the one hand, and the hegemony of influential countries within the Organization, on the other, will inevitably do tremendous damage and injustice to some Member States and to the credibility of the United Nations.
Mr. Wittig (Germany): I am taking the f loor in connection with draft resolution IV contained in document A/66/462/Add.3, entitled “Situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic”. Germany is one of the main sponsors of the draft resolution.
On 22 November, the Third Committee adopted the draft resolution on the human rights situation in Syria by a vote of 122 to 13, with 41 abstentions. That unprecedented and clear result was meant by the international community to send a strong signal to the Syrian authorities to immediately stop the violence and the systematic human rights violence against their own population.

Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran) (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): Pursuant to rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, I move that no action be taken on draft resolution III at this time.
The President (VSRNH�LQ�$UDELF): The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran has requested, pursuant to rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, that the Assembly not take action on draft resolution III. Rule 74 stipulates the following:
“During the discussion of any matter, a representative may move the adjournment of the debate on the item under discussion.

situations in all countries on an equal footing and based on constructive dialogue. For those reasons, Cuba will vote in favour of the motion for no action on draft resolution III.
Mr. Rishchynski (Canada): We wish to express our deep disappointment that a motion for no action has been proposed in the plenary of the General Assembly on draft resolution III, concerning the human rights situation in Iran. This is an extraordinary step, taken to stif le debate and undermine the authority and responsibility of the General Assembly. The draft resolution under consideration was adopted in the Third Committee by the large margin of 54 votes. The international community was clear in its message that the situation of human rights in Iran is of serious concern and deserves the General Assembly’s consideration. That is what we are here to do today.
This is how the work of the Committees of the General Assembly is intended to proceed. We debate, discuss and consider the issues in committee; we reach a decision, and that decision becomes our collective recommendation to the plenary of the Assembly. A motion for no action in the Assembly, after a draft resolution has been considered on its merits in the Third Committee and recommended to the Assembly for adoption, signifies a complete disregard for the work of Member States — ourselves — in the Committee. It also undermines the General Assembly’s jurisdiction.
We may have differing views on the substance of a human rights draft resolution, but we must all agree on the critical importance of maintaining the integrity of our work in the General Assembly and in the Third Committee. The Assembly must be permitted to consider any draft resolution that is recommended to it by the Committee on its individual merits. For all of these reasons, Member States have consistently rejected motions for no action in such circumstances in the past. We therefore strongly urge all Member States to once again vote against the no-action motion in order to allow the General Assembly to vote on the merits of the draft resolution.
Ms. Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland): I have the honour to speak today on behalf of seven countries — Andorra, Australia, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland, as well as my own country, Iceland — against the proposed motion for no action.
The General Assembly has entrusted its Third Committee, a body of universal membership, with
is undesirable, inconsistent and illegitimate and is of no genuine interest.
None of the countries submitting draft resolutions that we are considering under sub-item (c) of agenda item 69 has sufficient moral standing to act as the world’s court. To make such a claim is laughable and an offence to all who read the press every day, in particular those who read yesterday’s extensive report in the 1HZ� <RUN�7LPHV on the countless civilian victims claimed by the recent NATO bombings.
We reiterate that consideration of these issues falls solely to the Human Rights Council, which has adopted guidelines and methods for the Universal Periodic Review process sufficient to guarantee impartial objective and non-selective scrutiny of the human rights situation in any part of the world, without focusing exclusively on developing countries or any other country that is inconvenient to the interests of powerful countries. Dialogue, mutual respect and transparent and disinterested international cooperation that adheres strictly to the principles of the United Nations Charter are the essential framework for promoting and protecting human rights.
For all of these reasons, the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will vote for the no-action motion. We urge all delegations to do the same and thereby avoid using human rights as a tool of intervention, manipulation, criminalization and political pressure against given States.
Ms. Astiasarán Arias (Cuba) (VSRNH� LQ� 6SDQLVK): Cuba will vote in favour of the no-action motion that has been submitted under rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly with respect to the draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Cuba is well known to be traditionally opposed on principle to resolutions on specific countries that selectively target countries of the South on the basis of political motives that have nothing to do with genuine protection of human rights. The noxious practices of selectivity, politicization and double standards in considering human rights situations should be eliminated from human rights mechanisms within the United Nations.
Cuba believes that the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review is and must continue to be the ideal forum for investigating human rights

the mandate and responsibility to debate and act on human rights issues, including by addressing human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives. The no-action motion would in effect prevent the Assembly from fulfilling its mandate and acting on a recommendation by its Third Committee.
The responsibility to address human rights issues does not rest exclusively with the Human Rights Council or its Universal Periodic Review. We believe that any motion to preclude the discussion of human rights issues in the General Assembly is not only unjustified, but also undermines the credibility of this body. The Assembly and its Third Committee enrich the international human rights dialogue with their discussion, interactive dialogue with the special rapporteurs and representatives, and consideration of human rights issues and situations. This can take place, however, only if every serious human rights issue put forward for discussion is debated and considered on its merits.

In particular, my delegation cannot overlook the fact that some of the principal sponsors of the resolution have inappropriately manipulated their foreign aid as a weapon to bring pressure to bear on small developing countries to join with them in adopting this resolution. We therefore neither recognize nor accept the forced adoption of this resolution and categorically reject it.
In conclusion, my delegation would like to thank those delegations that expressed their support, solidarity and sympathy for us by voting against the resolution or abstaining.

The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): I shall now call on those delegations wishing to speak in explanation of vote on the resolutions just adopted.
Mr. Kim Song (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea): My delegation totally rejects resolution 66/174 as a politically motivated product of plotting and fabrication. There have never been violations of human rights in my country such as are mentioned in the resolution. The sponsors of the resolution introduced it in an effort to overthrow our political and social system by increasing international pressure on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. In fact, over the past 60 years we have suffered the imposition of economic sanctions, political pressure and even military threats from the principal sponsors of this resolution.
The real reason is not about human rights but that our political system is different from theirs. The kind of system we have is a matter to be decided by us. The resolution is also an extreme manifestation of selectivity and double standards, as well as a demonstration of the hotbed of confrontation and distrust we face. Although we maintain our consistent and principled position that all problems must be resolved through negotiations and dialogue, we cannot compromise with a confrontational approach of the kind embodied by the adoption of the resolution on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
All human rights issues should be considered within the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review mechanism, not in a plenary meeting of the General Assembly. This ongoing practice is clearly counter to the principles of impartiality and non-selectivity in the treatment of human rights issues.

Reports of the Third Committee
The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): The General Assembly will consider the reports of the Third Committee on agenda items 27, 28, 62, 64 to 69, 107, 108, 121 and 135.
I now request the Rapporteur of the Third Committee, Miss Kadra Ahmed Hassan of Djibouti, to introduce the reports of the Committee in one intervention.
Miss Hassan (Djibouti), Rapporteur of the Third Committee (VSRNH� LQ�)UHQFK): It is a great honour and privilege for me to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the Third Committee submitted under the agenda items allocated to it by the Assembly: items 27, 28, 62, 64 to 69, 107, 108, 121 and 135.
The reports, contained in documents A/66/454 to A/66/466, include the texts of draft resolutions and decisions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption. For the convenience of delegations, the Secretariat has issued document A/C.3/66/INF/1*, which contains a checklist of action taken on the draft proposals contained in the reports before the Assembly.
Under agenda item 27, entitled “Social development”, including its sub-items (a), (b) and (c), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 35 of document A/66/454 (Part II), the adoption of seven draft resolutions and, in paragraph 36, the adoption of one draft decision.
I call the Assembly’s attention to a minor error in the English version of the report. The following countries, which were inadvertently omitted and whose names were read out by the principal sponsors, should be added to the list contained in paragraph 9 on page 7: Austria, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Philippines, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Thailand and Ukraine.
The Assembly will also recall that, at its 73rd plenary meeting, on 5 December, the General Assembly adopted resolution 66/67, entitled “Tenth anniversary of the International Year of Volunteers”, which was recommended by the Third Committee in document A/66/454 (Part I).
Under agenda item 28, entitled “Advancement of women”, including its sub-items (a) and (b), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 26 of document A/66/455, the adoption of five draft resolutions and, in paragraph 27, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under agenda item 62, entitled “Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, questions relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 13 of document A/66/456, the adoption of three draft resolutions.
Under agenda item 64, entitled “Report of the Human Rights Council”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 20 of document A/66/457, the adoption of three draft resolutions and, in paragraph 21, the adoption of one draft decision.

document A/66/462/Add.1, the adoption of four draft resolutions.
It is my understanding that the Assembly will defer its consideration of draft resolution IV, entitled “Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto” until such time as it has before it the relevant report of the Fifth Committee.
Under sub-item (b) of agenda item 69, entitled “Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 108 of document A/66/462/Add.2, the adoption of 23 draft resolutions.
Under sub-item (c) of agenda item 69, entitled “Human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 33 of document A/66/462/ Add.3, the adoption of four draft resolutions.
It is my understanding that the Assembly will defer its consideration of draft resolution II, entitled “Situation of human rights in Myanmar”, until such time as it has before it the relevant report of the Fifth Committee.
Under sub-item (d) of agenda item 69, entitled “Comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action”, the Third Committee advises the Assembly, in document A/66/462/Add.4, that no action was required under the sub-item.
Under agenda item 107, entitled “Crime prevention and criminal justice”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 25 of document A/66/463, the adoption of six draft resolutions and, in paragraph 26, the adoption of one draft decision. Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolutions I and II, as contained in the report, it will not need to adopt draft resolutions I and II contained in the report under agenda item 108, entitled “International drug control”, as the texts in the two reports before the Assembly are identical.
I wish to point out that in paragraph 18 on page 11 of the English version of the report, the name of Switzerland should be deleted from the list of sponsors.
Under agenda item 108, entitled “International drug control”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 16 of document A/66/464, the adoption of
I should point out that on page 6 of the English version of the report, the draft resolution entitled “United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training”, should be designated as draft resolution II, not draft resolution III.
Under agenda item 65, entitled “Promotion and protection of the rights of children”, including its sub-items (a) and (b), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 32 of document A/66/458, the adoption of three draft resolutions and, in paragraph 33, the adoption of a draft decision.
I would like to make a minor correction to the English version of draft resolution I, entitled “Strengthening collaboration on child protection within the United Nations system”. Paragraph 2 should read as follows:
“Reiterates the importance of all relevant actors of the United Nations on child protection to continue to exercise their functions in a fully independent manner and to act in full observance of their respective mandates;”
The corrected version of the report, contained in document A/66/458*, has been published in the Official Document System.
Under agenda item 66, entitled “Rights of indigenous peoples”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 11 of document A/66/459, the adoption of one draft resolution.
Under agenda item 67, entitled “Elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance”, including its sub-items (a) and (b), the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 17 of document A/66/460, the adoption of two draft resolutions and, in paragraph 18, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under agenda item 68, entitled “Right of peoples to self-determination”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 19 of document A/66/461, the adoption of three draft resolutions and, in paragraph 20, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under agenda item 69, entitled “Promotion and protection of human rights”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 5 of document A/66/462, the adoption of one draft decision.
Under sub-item (a) of agenda item 69, entitled “Implementation of human rights instruments”, the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 22 of

“When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”
May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance. This means that where recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Committee.
Before proceeding, I would like to draw the attention of members to a note by the Secretariat, entitled “List of proposals contained in the reports of the Third Committee”, which has been circulated, in English only, as document A/C.3/66/INF/1*. That note has been distributed desk-to-desk as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the Committee in its reports.
In that connection, members will find in the third column of the note the numbers of the draft resolutions or decisions of the Committee, with the corresponding symbols of the reports for action in the plenary in the second column of the same note.
Furthermore, Members are reminded that additional sponsors are no longer accepted now that draft resolutions and decisions have been adopted by the Committee. Any clarification about sponsorship should be addressed to the Secretary of the Third Committee.

Lastly, under agenda item 135, entitled “Programme planning”, the Third Committee advises the Assembly, in document A/66/466, that no action was required under the agenda item.
I would like to thank my fellow Bureau members, in particular the Chair of the Committee, Ambassador Hussein Haniff, and Vice-Chairs Donnette Critchlow, Carolina Popovici and Luca Zelioli, as well as the Secretary of the Committee, Otto Gustafik, for their support and friendship in making this session efficient and ensuring its timely conclusion.
I respectfully commend the reports of the Third Committee to the plenary of the General Assembly for its consideration.

Affirmed in international instruments, the family, founded on the marriage of one man and one woman, is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.

With the family institution increasingly under attack in many societies, my delegation reaffirms the indispensible role of the family, bearing in mind the different cultural, political and social realities in which the family exists. Each family is called to be a living cell of society, a wellspring of virtues, a school of constructive and peaceful coexistence, an instrument of harmony and a privileged environment in which human life is welcomed and protected, joyfully and responsibly, from its beginning until its natural end. In that regard, my delegation takes the opportunity to point out the role of parents, and in particular their primary responsibility, prior to the State, for the upbringing and development of their children.
Finally, resolution 66/126 rightly encourages Member States to adopt holistic approaches to policies and programmes that address family poverty, social exclusion and work/family balance and that share good practices in those areas.
I take this opportunity to express gratitude for the support that resolution 66/126 gives to the family.

I give the f loor to the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania in explanation of vote before the voting.
Ms. Maduhu (United Republic of Tanzania): I take the f loor today to speak on behalf of the members of the Group of African States on draft resolution I, entitled “Report of the Human Rights Council”. For the African Group, the draft resolution is in conformity, from the procedural aspect, with the status of the Human Rights Council as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, and whereby the Third Committee is the Main Committee of the Assembly responsible for the consideration of human rights issues, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 65/291 on the review of the Human Rights Council. Thus, all recommendations of the Council, including its decisions and resolutions, should be considered by the Third Committee.
The Group has presented the aforementioned draft resolution despite the fact that it observes with deep concern that the work of the Council has recently become more politicized and selective. The Group is alarmed at the adoption by the Council of several resolutions, including one on an undefined notion that has no legal foundation in international law. The Group reaffirms that fundamental freedoms and human rights are universally recognized and should be enjoyed by all human beings without discrimination on the basis of their humanity, without regard to any particular individual conduct or sexual preference.
The Group is also alarmed at the systematic attempts to misinterpret the Universal Declaration and international treaties to include undefined notions. The Group regrets that the Council continues to adopt a confrontational rather than a cooperative and consensus-building approach in its work, resulting in an increasing number of resolutions being adopted by voting. These include recommendations that are of utmost important to the Group, inter alia, concerning trafficking in persons, access to medicine in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, combating contemporary forms of slavery, the right to development, and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms through a better understanding of traditional values of humankind, among others.

As my delegation has stated in other forums, no international consensus exists regarding the terms of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity”, which are ill-defined terms that are open to various forms of subjective interpretation. For that reason, their inclusion under the category of “Other status” in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights would be inappropriate and, in any event, unnecessary in the case of rights afforded to all human beings.
The attempt to create novel categories of non-discrimination ex post facto and read them into the Covenants themselves exceeds the competence of the treaty-monitoring bodies and would undermine the reasons why States ratified such treaties. Furthermore, principles enunciated by experts have no binding authorities, save those which are consonant with internationally agreed human rights law.

would like to reaffirm that the rationale behind creating the Universal Periodic Review was to ensure universality and non-selectivity in the work of the Human Rights Council, the real performance of which, in a logical setting, would allow the United Nations human rights machinery to act beyond the monopoly of a few Member States. However, it is deplorable that, despite the existence of the mechanism of the Universal Periodic Review in the Human Rights Council, certain countries still continue to bring country-specific resolutions before both the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly to meet their political purposes.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has always manifested its sincere commitment to the promotion of human rights at the national, regional and international levels. Our unwavering commitment and corresponding efforts and activities on the promotion of human rights emanate from our religious obligation and the provisions of our Constitution, as well as from the international treaties to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party. Accordingly, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is fully cooperating with the United Nations mechanism on human rights.
On 17 and 18 October, the third periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was considered by the Human Rights Committee with the active and constructive participation of a high-ranking delegation dispatched from Iran. My country is also an active party to many of the core international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
In that regard, Iran submitted a third periodic report on the basis of article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and defended that report on 17 and 18 October during the 103rd session of the Human Rights Committee in Geneva. The second periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran within the framework of the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was also submitted to the relevant committee. Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran has submitted and defended two reports, and is in the final stage of preparing its

Report of the Third Committee (A/66/462/Add.3)
The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): The Assembly has before it four draft resolutions recommended by the Third Committee in paragraph 33 of its report. Before proceeding further, I should like to inform members that action on draft resolution II, entitled “Situation of human rights in Myanmar”, is postponed to a later date to allow time for the review of its programme budget implications by the Fifth Committee. The Assembly will take action on draft resolution II as soon as the report of the Fifth Committee on its programme budget implications is available.
I now give the f loor to those representatives wishing to speak in explanation of vote before the voting.
Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the outset, let me thank you, Sir, for providing me with this opportunity to reiterate in brief the position of my delegation with regard to draft resolution III, entitled “Human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran”.
Building on the invaluable lessons learned from the shortcomings of the former Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council has inspired new hopes and desires for sound and decent solutions to the maladies of the Commission, in particular regarding its selective approach towards the human rights situations in different countries. Likewise, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers the Human Rights Council to be a focal point for all Governments to address global human rights challenges devoid of politicization, selectivity, double standards and confrontation.
While reiterating our grave dissatisfaction with the emerging concerted efforts to force the Council back onto the path of the former Commission, my delegation
11-64365 19
A/66/PV.89
A/66/462/Add.3, under agenda item 69, “Promotion and protection of human rights”.
No one can ignore, and members know full well, that the international legal framework within which Member States function is based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a country on any pretext whatsoever. That principle has been enshrined in many international instruments, notably in Article 2.7 of the Charter of the United Nations, and in many relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
Firmly convinced of the importance of protecting and promoting human rights, we are highly surprised by the claims of the main proponents of draft resolution IV. The authors of the text, who claim to promote and protect human rights in Syria, have voted against the promotion and protection of the rights of Syrian civilians living under Israeli occupation in the Syrian Golan. Furthermore, those same States have voted against many resolutions on the just and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The authors of the draft resolution exploit human rights issues to conspire against the sovereignty, stability, independence and territorial integrity of certain Member States.
The draft resolution before us today is simply one effort among many on the part of some authors — I do not say all, but some — that are participating in the political, media and diplomatic war against my country, Syria, in an attempt to create an environment conducive to the implementation of their plan to fragment the people of our region along communitarian, ethnic, religious and sectarian lines to justify the application of the Israeli theory of the Judaism of the State of Israel, which is being promoted by the United States and the principal sponsors of the draft resolution against Syria. That is being done to the detriment of the national, legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, which have been recognized hundreds of times by the United Nations over the decades.
The most striking proof of that f lagrant political hypocrisy, duplicity and manoeuvring is the fallacious claim by the authors of the draft, whose own States have imposed economic sanctions on Syria, its media — and on one daily newspaper in particular — and on our public and private television channels. Why? The answer is clear — that newspaper and those television channels are systematically broadcasting the confessions of terrorist groups and elements belonging to armed groups about foreign arms transfers across the internationally
third and fourth reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
I would like to reiterate the position of my Government that if Canada is really concerned about the human rights situation, it is certainly on the wrong track. While saying that, we do not mean to counter those unsubstantiated allegations by accusing our accusers in return or by reminding members of the concerns raised by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and about the situation of minority groups in that country. We by no means intend to say that, nor do we seek to refer to the serious concerns expressed by the independent expert on minority issues to the Human Rights Council over the use of racial profiling as a systematic practice and the excessive use of force leading to death, particularly with respect to young black males.
Nor do we intend to refer to the human rights situation in the United States, even in recent months; or to that country’s reaction to the so-called peaceful protests around the country; to the reports by reliable sources in 2011 regarding the continued use of excessive force and cruel prison conditions, including indefinite military detention, in Guantanamo; or to the devastating situation of detainees in the United States detention facility on the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and in secret United States detention centres around the world.
My delegation believes that the right track resides in the sincere willingness and determination of the countries involved to work together and to create a favourable environment based upon common understanding and respect for the promotion of the human rights situation at any level. It is the strong belief of my country that naming and shaming tactics, the adoption of country-specific resolutions and the manipulation of United Nations human rights mechanisms will not lead us towards mutually acceptable results that will benefit the promotion of human rights.
Finally, in proposing a motion of no-action on draft resolution III, my delegation would like to request all delegations to consider the politicized nature of this move. We urge them to vote in favour of the motion and to reject such attempts to save the credibility and integrity of the United Nations human rights mechanism.
Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): I would like to thank you, Sir, for giving me the f loor. I wish to convey the position of my country regarding draft resolution IV contained in document
20 11-64365

behest of outside agendas to provoke communitarian, sectarian and factional war in Syria and to destabilize and destroy the well-known coexistence in my country.
The documents include confessions by elements of those armed groups about crimes involving arms transfers from certain neighbouring countries of Syria. We have also regularly provided the Secretary-General and members of the Security Council with quasi-periodic information concerning Syrian reforms that are currently under way. Unfortunately, despite all this transparency, none of that information appears in the draft resolution against Syria, which treats the issue in a one-sided manner.
In another attempt by certain of the draft resolution’s authors to destroy Syria through foreign military intervention using civilian protection as a pretext, the Security Council recently heard a briefing from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who presented the human rights situation in Syria in a sentimental, subjective, politicized and unprofessional way in an effort to tell certain countries what they expected to hear.
During the briefing, the High Commissioner laid full blame for the events in Syria on the Syrian Government. Going beyond her mandate and the mandate of her Office, she went so far as to call for the transfer of the Syrian issue to the International Criminal Court. At the same time, however, she closed her eyes to the human rights violations committed by armed terrorist groups and to the billions of dollars that have been provided to those groups in the form of money, weapons, media and logistical support to destabilize Syria, destroy its people and force it to change its national and independent political options.
Syria has affirmed and reaffirms today that the only solution to the current crisis is to support total and inclusive national dialogue and reform, meet the legitimate aspirations of our people, and conduct an honest investigation into the events taking place. We call on States Members of the United Nations to support necessary reforms that reflect the demands of our people and an inclusive Syrian national dialogue, and to abstain from considering politicized and unprofessional reports that harm the credibility and integrity of the United Nations.
We wish to ask a number of questions. Where were the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council when Israel violated
recognized borders of Syria from certain neighbouring countries. Those armed elements are receiving funds and advanced communications technologies from those neighbours, who are encouraging them to commit acts of terrorism. We have also heard terrible confessions of assassination, rape and mutilation being perpetrated by those same elements against civilian and military victims, along with the destruction of private and public property.
Can the authors of the draft resolution explain to us the link between the promotion and protection of human rights in Syria, on the one hand, and the bombings of gas pipelines, trains and railways; the explosion at an oil refinery in Homs; the murder of some military pilots; and attacks on civilians when they go to school or evade the occupation through civil disobedience, on the other?
My country is indignant about that selective approach and about the ongoing deception and political pressure. We are all the more so because the main authors of the draft resolution have a black history on human rights. Indeed, certain European countries and the United States of America continue to harass sovereign countries, threaten the peoples of the developing world, impose unilateral economic sanctions, and deprive their populations of the right to life, development and peace.
Furthermore, how can certain other countries that have co-sponsored this draft resolution claim to defend human rights in Syria when their own authorities are depriving their own people of the most basic human rights, including the right to elections, the rights of women and minorities, the rights of foreign nationals, and freedom of worship? Let us not forget that those same countries do not even have constitutions that guarantee democratic parliamentary rights, multi-party systems or alternation of authority.
On behalf of my country, we have submitted to the Secretary-General, the President of the Security Council, the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Executive Director of UNICEF and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict fully documented information on the confessions that have been made by armed terrorist elements, through audio and visual recordings, confirming their involvement in the killing of civilians and military personnel. Those confessions also reveal acts of mutilation and vandalism committed at the
11-64365 21
A/66/PV.89
Despite that signal, the crackdown by Syrian security forces against peaceful protesters and civilians has continued unabated. According to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, reliable information indicates ongoing systematic attacks on civilians, including a shoot-to-kill policy by Syrian security forces, thousands of arbitrary arrests and the widespread use of torture in Syrian detention centres.
The number of people killed since the protests in Syria began earlier this year now probably exceeds 5,000, including many children, as attested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Pillay. Despite the repeated calls of the international community, the Syrian authorities continue to refuse access to the commission of inquiry mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council and have so far have failed to implement the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States.
The draft resolution before us is a unique and ad hoc response to the dramatic events taking place on the ground in the Syrian Arab Republic as we speak. Over the past weekend alone, more than 20 dead were added to the sad and long list of victims.
The draft resolution enjoys substantial support from Member States in the Arab region. It underlines the courageous initiative of the League of Arab States to address the situation in Syria and calls for full implementation of its Plan of Action by the Syrian authorities in its entirety and without delay. That is the call of the draft resolution. It supports the voice of the Arab region. Let me emphasize that the draft resolution before the Assembly does not establish any new mechanism as such.
The human rights situation in Syria continues to deteriorate. It is time for the General Assembly, as the main and universal body of the United Nations, to reinforce the clear message of its Third Committee and call on the Syrian authorities to immediately stop human rights violations and the violence against its own population. The General Assembly should also urge the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with the United Nations and with the League of Arab States. My delegation will therefore vote in favour of draft resolution IV and calls on all Member States to do likewise.
The President (VSRNH�LQ�$UDELF): We will now take decisions on draft resolutions I, III and IV, one by one.
and continues to violate the human rights of people in the occupied Syrian Golan, a part of Syria that is dear to us and whose inhabitants have for four decades been targeted by systematic and grave human rights violations? For four decades, the Security Council has been unable to carry out its duty due to the position of certain influential hegemonic countries that support Israel and its aggressive expansionist policies.
What is the link between the promotion and protection of human rights in Syria and the frenetic attempts of certain sponsors of the draft resolution to propagate extreme Salafist Wahhabi thought in Syria, with its inevitable attacks on the admirable example of coexistence that has prevailed among the different components of the Syrian people for thousands of years? Why are groups accused of belonging to the Salafi school of thought held in Western prisons, such as Guantanamo, on the one hand, while the same extremist sectarian Salafi groups are allowed to become active in Syria and certain other countries of the region, on the other? Those are questions that we lay before the States Members of the United Nations.
In the light of the foregoing, my country calls for a recorded vote on draft resolution IV and, in order to preserve the dignity and credibility of the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations, I call on all Member States to vote against it. I hope that each and every one of us here will understand that encouraging the diabolical union between petrodollars, on the one hand, and the hegemony of influential countries within the Organization, on the other, will inevitably do tremendous damage and injustice to some Member States and to the credibility of the United Nations.
Mr. Wittig (Germany): I am taking the f loor in connection with draft resolution IV contained in document A/66/462/Add.3, entitled “Situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic”. Germany is one of the main sponsors of the draft resolution.
On 22 November, the Third Committee adopted the draft resolution on the human rights situation in Syria by a vote of 122 to 13, with 41 abstentions. That unprecedented and clear result was meant by the international community to send a strong signal to the Syrian authorities to immediately stop the violence and the systematic human rights violence against their own population.

The President (VSRNH�LQ�$UDELF): I give the f loor to the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on a point of order.
Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran) (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): Pursuant to rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, I move that no action be taken on draft resolution III at this time.
The President (VSRNH�LQ�$UDELF): The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran has requested, pursuant to rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, that the Assembly not take action on draft resolution III. Rule 74 stipulates the following:
“During the discussion of any matter, a representative may move the adjournment of the debate on the item under discussion. In addition to the proposer of the motion, two representatives may speak in favour of, and two against, the motion, after which the motion shall be immediately put to the vote.”
(VSRNH�LQ�(QJOLVK)
I would therefore invite delegations that so wish to speak either for or against the motion. There will be no more than two delegations speaking in favour and no more than two speaking against.
Ms. Vivas Mendoza (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (VSRNH� LQ� 6SDQLVK): The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela supports the motion that no action be taken on draft resolution III contained in document A/66/462/Add.3. Our delegation firmly rejects the continuing practice promoted by some States Members of the Organization to condemn individually and selectively certain States, using their human rights situation as justification.
Draft resolutions on specific countries have become instruments to promote particular political interests and trigger strategic confrontation. That repeated practice
Draft resolution I is entitled “Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”. A recorded vote has been requested.

situations in all countries on an equal footing and based on constructive dialogue. For those reasons, Cuba will vote in favour of the motion for no action on draft resolution III.
Mr. Rishchynski (Canada): We wish to express our deep disappointment that a motion for no action has been proposed in the plenary of the General Assembly on draft resolution III, concerning the human rights situation in Iran. This is an extraordinary step, taken to stif le debate and undermine the authority and responsibility of the General Assembly. The draft resolution under consideration was adopted in the Third Committee by the large margin of 54 votes. The international community was clear in its message that the situation of human rights in Iran is of serious concern and deserves the General Assembly’s consideration. That is what we are here to do today.
This is how the work of the Committees of the General Assembly is intended to proceed. We debate, discuss and consider the issues in committee; we reach a decision, and that decision becomes our collective recommendation to the plenary of the Assembly. A motion for no action in the Assembly, after a draft resolution has been considered on its merits in the Third Committee and recommended to the Assembly for adoption, signifies a complete disregard for the work of Member States — ourselves — in the Committee. It also undermines the General Assembly’s jurisdiction.
We may have differing views on the substance of a human rights draft resolution, but we must all agree on the critical importance of maintaining the integrity of our work in the General Assembly and in the Third Committee. The Assembly must be permitted to consider any draft resolution that is recommended to it by the Committee on its individual merits. For all of these reasons, Member States have consistently rejected motions for no action in such circumstances in the past. We therefore strongly urge all Member States to once again vote against the no-action motion in order to allow the General Assembly to vote on the merits of the draft resolution.
Ms. Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland): I have the honour to speak today on behalf of seven countries — Andorra, Australia, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland, as well as my own country, Iceland — against the proposed motion for no action.
The General Assembly has entrusted its Third Committee, a body of universal membership, with
is undesirable, inconsistent and illegitimate and is of no genuine interest.
None of the countries submitting draft resolutions that we are considering under sub-item (c) of agenda item 69 has sufficient moral standing to act as the world’s court. To make such a claim is laughable and an offence to all who read the press every day, in particular those who read yesterday’s extensive report in the 1HZ� <RUN�7LPHV on the countless civilian victims claimed by the recent NATO bombings.
We reiterate that consideration of these issues falls solely to the Human Rights Council, which has adopted guidelines and methods for the Universal Periodic Review process sufficient to guarantee impartial objective and non-selective scrutiny of the human rights situation in any part of the world, without focusing exclusively on developing countries or any other country that is inconvenient to the interests of powerful countries. Dialogue, mutual respect and transparent and disinterested international cooperation that adheres strictly to the principles of the United Nations Charter are the essential framework for promoting and protecting human rights.
For all of these reasons, the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will vote for the no-action motion. We urge all delegations to do the same and thereby avoid using human rights as a tool of intervention, manipulation, criminalization and political pressure against given States.
Ms. Astiasarán Arias (Cuba) (VSRNH� LQ� 6SDQLVK): Cuba will vote in favour of the no-action motion that has been submitted under rule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly with respect to the draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Cuba is well known to be traditionally opposed on principle to resolutions on specific countries that selectively target countries of the South on the basis of political motives that have nothing to do with genuine protection of human rights. The noxious practices of selectivity, politicization and double standards in considering human rights situations should be eliminated from human rights mechanisms within the United Nations.
Cuba believes that the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review is and must continue to be the ideal forum for investigating human rights

the mandate and responsibility to debate and act on human rights issues, including by addressing human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives. The no-action motion would in effect prevent the Assembly from fulfilling its mandate and acting on a recommendation by its Third Committee.
The responsibility to address human rights issues does not rest exclusively with the Human Rights Council or its Universal Periodic Review. We believe that any motion to preclude the discussion of human rights issues in the General Assembly is not only unjustified, but also undermines the credibility of this body. The Assembly and its Third Committee enrich the international human rights dialogue with their discussion, interactive dialogue with the special rapporteurs and representatives, and consideration of human rights issues and situations. This can take place, however, only if every serious human rights issue put forward for discussion is debated and considered on its merits.
Not least for this reason, we are keen to know the views of all other delegations on the draft resolution before us. We will vote against the motion for no action and encourage all other delegations to do the same.

In particular, my delegation cannot overlook the fact that some of the principal sponsors of the resolution have inappropriately manipulated their foreign aid as a weapon to bring pressure to bear on small developing countries to join with them in adopting this resolution.

The President (VSRNH� LQ� $UDELF): I shall now call on those delegations wishing to speak in explanation of vote on the resolutions just adopted.
Mr. Kim Song (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea): My delegation totally rejects resolution 66/174 as a politically motivated product of plotting and fabrication. There have never been violations of human rights in my country such as are mentioned in the resolution. The sponsors of the resolution introduced it in an effort to overthrow our political and social system by increasing international pressure on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. In fact, over the past 60 years we have suffered the imposition of economic sanctions, political pressure and even military threats from the principal sponsors of this resolution.
The real reason is not about human rights but that our political system is different from theirs. The kind of system we have is a matter to be decided by us. The resolution is also an extreme manifestation of selectivity and double standards, as well as a demonstration of the hotbed of confrontation and distrust we face. Although we maintain our consistent and principled position that all problems must be resolved through negotiations and dialogue, we cannot compromise with a confrontational approach of the kind embodied by the adoption of the resolution on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
All human rights issues should be considered within the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review mechanism, not in a plenary meeting of the General Assembly. This ongoing practice is clearly counter to the principles of impartiality and non-selectivity in the treatment of human rights issues.
