Letter dated 6 January 2011 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council
This is to inform you that Mr. Christof Wegner (Germany), whom I appointed on 5 November 2010 to serve on the Panel of Experts established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1929 (2010), was not able to join the Panel. Accordingly, in consultation with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), I wish to inform you that I have appointed Mr. Thomas F. H. Mazet (Germany), to serve on the Panel of Experts and carry out tasks as specified in paragraph 29 of the resolution. The Panel is now at its full strength of eight members. I should be grateful if you would bring this information to the attention of the members of the Security Council.
