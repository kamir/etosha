Letter dated 7 June 2010 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council
I have the honour to refer to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, established on 30 November 1999 pursuant to Security Council resolution 1279 (1999) and most recently extended by Council resolution 1925 (2010) until 30 June 2010, after which date the Mission will bear the title of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Following the usual consultations, I would like to inform you of my intention to appoint Roger A. Meece (United States of America) as my Special Representative for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Head of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mr. Meece, who served as United States Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, will replace Alan Doss as of 1 July 2010. I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mr. Doss for his significant contribution to the United Nations peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his effective leadership of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council.
