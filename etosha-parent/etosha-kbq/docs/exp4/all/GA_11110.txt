GENERAL ASSEMBLY, ACTING ON RECOMMENDATION OF ITS FIFTH COMMITTEE, ADOPTS
PEACEKEEPING BUDGET OF MORE THAN $7 BILLION FOR 2011-2012
Agrees One-Time Supplemental Payment of $85 Million for Troop-Contributing Countries, Seeks Creation of Advisory Group to Consider Their Reimbursement Rates
In the early hours of the morning today, the General Assembly, acting on the recommendations of its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary), adopted a peacekeeping budget of more than $7 billion for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012.
The budget, which provides for 13 peacekeeping missions and the peacekeeping support account, is broken down as follows:
Mission Amount approved AMISOM (African Union Mission in Somalia) $303.91 million MINURSO ( Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara) $61.43 million MINUSTAH (Stabilization Mission in Haiti) $793.30 million MONUSCO (Organization Stabilization Mission
in Democratic Republic of the Congo) $1.42 billion
UNAMID (Hybrid Operation in Darfur) $1.70 billion UNDOF (Disengagement Observer Force) $49.56 million UNFICYP (Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus) $55.74 million UNIFIL (Interim Force in Lebanon) $545.47 million UNMIK ( Mission in Kosovo) $44.91 million UNMIL ( Mission in Liberia) $510.07 million UNMIT (Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste) $196.74 million UNOCI (Operation in Côte d’Ivoire TBA UNMIS ( Mission in the Sudan) TBA Support Account $352.42 million
The text for each Mission sets forth the provisions for apportioning the sums among Member States and specifies any offsets that might apply.
The Assembly adopted all 23 resolutions this morning without a vote, except the text on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which it passed by 117 in favour to 3 against (Canada, Israel, United States), with 1 abstention (Tuvalu).  (For details of the vote, see Annex II.)
Before acting on the UNIFIL text as a whole, the Assembly conducted a separate recorded vote on several paragraphs that referred to previous resolutions calling for Israel to pay $1.1 million for the damages resulting from the 1996 incident at UNIFIL headquarters in Qana, Lebanon.  Those paragraphs were retained by a recorded vote of 70 in favour to 3 against ( Canada, Israel, United States), with 47 abstentions.  (See Annex I.)
Among the consensus resolutions was a text on closed peacekeeping missions, in which the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to return $180 million, or 78.1 per cent, of the $230.74 million net cash available for credit to Member States as of 30 June 2010, based on the scale applicable to each
Mission’s last assessment.  Further to that text, the Assembly decided to consider during the second part of its resumed sixty-sixth session the financial position of closed peacekeeping missions, and asked the Secretary-General to provide it with concrete proposals and alternatives to address outstanding dues owed to Member States from closed peacekeeping missions that are in net cash deficit.
The Assembly also adopted a consensus text on cross-cutting issues, which, among other things, authorized, on an exceptional basis, a one-time supplemental payment of $85 million to troop- contributing countries during the 2011/12 period, without prejudice to the integrity of the process set forth in Assembly resolution 63/285.
Further to that text, the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to create a senior advisory group by October 2011, comprising five eminent persons of relevant experience, five representatives from major troop contributors, five representatives from major financial contributors and one member from each regional group, to consider reimbursement rates for troop-contributing countries and related issues.
Also this morning, the Assembly appointed David Traystman ( United States) as a member of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), to serve from 23 July 2011 to year’s end.
Background
The General Assembly met this morning to take action on resolutions submitted by its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).
Action on Drafts
Opening the meeting, Fifth Committee Rapporteur NICOLE MANNION ( Ireland) introduced that body’s reports.
Taking up the first report, on the appointment of members of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) (document A/65/562/Add.1), the Assembly by consensus appointed David Traystman (United States) as a member of the ACABQ for a term of office beginning on 23 July 2011 and ending on 31 December 2011.
Acting on its first text, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, the resolution on financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors, (document A/65/594/Add. 1).  By that text, the Assembly accepted the audited financial statements of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 and endorsed the recommendations contained in the report of the Board of Auditors.
Next, it adopted, by consensus, a text on estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (document A/65/646/Add.3), by which the Assembly approved the budget of $1.67 million net ($1.69 million gross) for the Panel of Experts on Libya for the period from 1 June to 31 December 2011, and the budget of $1.47 million net ($1.59 million gross) for the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2011.
Turning to the report on administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (document A/65/890), the Assembly took up a draft resolution on cross-cutting issues (draft resolution I), adopting that six-part text without a vote.
The resolution dealt with matters related to financial management, personnel issues, operational requirements for peacekeeping operations, air operations, special measures for protection from sexual exploitation, and the organization’s Global Field Support Strategy.
Among other things, the Assembly paid tribute to all United Nations peacekeepers who had been wounded in the line of duty and asked the Secretary-General to take urgent measures to eliminate the existing backlog of death and disability claims pending for more than three months, and to report on progress made in that regard to the Assembly during the second part of its sixty-sixth session.
Also by the text, the Assembly decided to provide, on an exceptional basis, a one-time
supplemental payment of $85 million to troop-contributing countries during the 2011/12 period, without prejudice to integrity of the process set forth in Assembly resolution 63/285.  Furthermore, the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to establish a senior advisory group by October 2011, consisting of five eminent persons, of relevant experience, five representatives from major troop contributors, five representatives from major contributors and one member from each regional group to consider rates of reimbursement to troop-contributing countries and related issues.
Next, adopting, without a vote, a draft resolution on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations (draft resolution II), the Assembly approved support account requirements in the amount of $351.19 million for the 2011/12 period.  It applied the $3.38 million representing the excess of the authorized level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010 to that resource requirement.  The net estimated staff assessment income of $31.47  million was set off against the balance of $366.21 million, to be prorated among the budgets of the individual active peacekeeping operations.
The Assembly then adopted, again without a vote, a draft resolution on the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi (draft resolution III).
(Amount to be apportioned will be announced at a later date.)
Then, by a text on reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment (draft resolution IV), adopted by consensus, the Assembly endorsed the conclusions and recommendations in the ACABQ report on such procedures (document A/65/830) and asked the Secretary-General to ensure they were implemented.
The Assembly next adopted by consensus a draft on closed peacekeeping missions (draft resolution V), deciding to return to the Government of Kuwait some $70,600, reflecting two thirds of the adjusted net credits available in the account of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission. More broadly, the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to return 78.1 per cent of the $230.74 million net cash available for credit to Member States as at 30 June 2010, in the amount of $180 million, based on the scale applicable to each mission’s last assessment.
Further to that text, the Assembly decided to consider during the second part of its resumed sixty-sixth session the position of closed peacekeeping missions, including remaining sums owed to Member States, after implementing the relevant provisions of this text, determined to have been $50.67 million as of 30 June 2010, under the agenda item entitled “Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations”.  The Assembly asked the Secretary- General to include concrete proposals and alternatives, for its consideration and approval, on how to address outstanding dues owed to Member States from closed peacekeeping missions that are in net cash deficit.
Afterwards, the Assembly adopted a draft on financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) (document A/65/653/Add.1), issued 19 May 2011, by which it deferred until its sixty-sixth session action on the unencumbered balance of $149.95 million and other income and adjustments totalling $13.47 million and an increase of $1.53 million in the estimated staff assessment income.  Further, it asked the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its sixty- sixth session updated information on the cash position of the Mission.
In its preamble, the text recalled that in its latest resolution 1923 (2010) of 25 May 2010, the Security Council extended the mandate of the Mission until 31 December 2010, decided to reduce the military component of the Mission to 2,200 military personnel, and called upon the Secretary-General to complete the withdrawal of all uniformed and civilian components, other than those required for the Mission’s liquidation, by 31 December 2010.
The Assembly then adopted by consensus a text on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) (document A/65/881).
(Amount to be appropriated will be issued at a later date.)
Next, it adopted without a vote a resolution on financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) (document A/65/882).
(Amount to be appropriated will be issued at a later date.)
In a consensus text on the Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC); Financing of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO) (document A/65/654/Add.1), the Assembly recalled Security Council resolution 1925 (2010), by which the Council decided that as of 1 July 2010, the Mission would bear the title of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and be deployed until 30 June 2011.
The Assembly further decided to appropriate $1.42 billion for the 2011/12 period.  States that had fulfilled their obligations to the operation were given an additional offset equal to their respective share of an unencumbered balance of $35.07 million.  It decided that States that had not fulfilled their obligations would have their outstanding obligations offset also by their respective share of that amount, and that the $1.84 million increase in estimated staff assessment income, in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010, would be added to the amounts to be credited to Member States as part of their offset.
In a further provision, the Assembly decided not to abolish the child protection posts, and asked the Secretary-General to make every effort to fill them.  It also asked him to identify and abolish an equivalent number of posts at the same level that had been vacant for more than a year to offset the financial impact of retaining the child protection posts.
Next, the Assembly adopted without a vote a text on the financing of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) (document A/65/883), by which it appropriated $$196.74 million to UNMIT for the 2011/12 period.  States that had fulfilled their obligations to the operation were given an additional offset equal to their respective share of an unencumbered balance of $17.79 million, while States that had not fulfilled their obligations had their outstanding obligations offset by that amount.
The draft further decided to add the increase of $947,800 in estimated staff assessment income, in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010, to the credits from the unencumbered balance of $17.8 million.
In a consensus text on financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) (document A/65/878), the Assembly, recalling in its resolution 1827 (2008) of 30 July 2008 that the Council had terminated the mandate of the Mission effective 31 July 2008, took note of the status of contributions to UNMEE as of 30 April 2011 of credits totalling $2.5 million, as well as included the item in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session.  It also took note of the report of the Secretary- General on the final disposition of UNMEE’s assets and encouraged Member States that are owed credits for the closed peacekeeping mission accounts to apply those credits to any accounts where the Member State concerned has outstanding assessed contributions.
The Assembly then adopted by consensus a draft on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) (document A/65/879), by which it decided that Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to that Mission should be credited with their respective share of the $1.81 million unencumbered balance and other income in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010.  Further, it decided that the respective share of Member States that had not fulfilled their obligations would be offset against their outstanding obligations and that the $157,600 increase in the estimated staff assessment income would be added to the credits from the unencumbered balance.
Adopting a consensus text on financing the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (document A/65/655/Add.1), the Assembly expressed deep concern over MINUSTAH’s continuing high vacancy rate, especially of the national temporary positions, and its negative impact on MINUSTAH’s work.  It asked the Secretary-General to intensify efforts to put into effect measures to mitigate MINUSTAH’s environmental impact, as well as to strengthen coordination among the Mission, the United Nations Country Team and other United Nations entities to address, among other things, the root causes of unexpected emergencies, such as the situation due to the cholera outbreak.  Further, the Assembly appropriated $793.3 million for MINUSTAH’s maintenance.
In a consensus text on financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) (document A/65/884), the Assembly appropriated $44.9 million for UNMIK’s maintenance for the 2011/12 period.
By a draft text on Financing of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) (document A/65/885), also adopted without a vote, the Assembly appropriated $510.07 millionto maintain UNMIL.
Also by its terms, States that had fulfilled their obligations to the operation were given an additional offset equal to their respective share of an unencumbered balance of $32.77 million.  States that had not fulfilled their obligations had their outstanding obligations offset also by their respective share of that amount.  The $361,900 increase in estimated staff assessment income, in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010, was added to the amounts to be credited to Member States as part of their offset.
By a consensus resolution on financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) (document A/65/886), the Assembly appropriated $49.56 million to maintain UNDOF for the 2011/12 period and it encouraged the Secretary-General to continue taking additional measures to ensure the safety and security of all UNIFIL personnel working under United Nations auspices.
Next, the Assembly adopted by a recorded vote of 117 in favour to 3 against ( Canada, Israel, United States), with 1 abstention ( Tuvalu), a text on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (document A/65/880).  (For details of the vote, see Annex II.)  By its terms, the Assembly appropriated $545.47 million to maintain UNIFIL during the 2011/12 period.
Before voting on the resolution as a whole, the Assembly held a single, separate vote on several paragraphs referring to previous resolutions calling for Israel to pay $1.1 million for the damages resulting from the 1996 incident at UNIFIL headquarters in Qana, Lebanon.  Those paragraphs were retained by a recorded vote of 70 in favour to 3 against ( Canada, Israel, United States), with 47 abstentions.  (See Annex I.)
Also by the text, for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, their apportionment would be offset by their respective share of the unencumbered balance and other income accumulated in the financial period ended 30 June 2010 ($62.95 million).  For those that had not fulfilled their financial obligations, their outstanding contribution would be offset by their respective share of the same.  An increase of $1.1 million in the estimated staff assessment income would be added to the credits from the unencumbered balance.
Further to the draft, the Assembly took note of $59.5 million in outstanding contributions as of 30 April 2011, and it noted with concern that only 91 Member States had paid their assessed contributions in full.  It expressed concern over the financial situation of reimbursing troop contributors that bore additional burdens due to overdue staff assessment payments by Member States, and concern over the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, especially in Africa.
Speaking in explanation of vote, the representative of Syria said he had joined the consensus on the resolutions related to financing of UNDOF and UNIFIL.  Israel, which was the occupier, aggressor and the reason for having to create the missions, should be responsible for their financing.  He agreed with the principles set forth in Assembly resolution 1874 (1963).
The representative of the United States said that, while his country strongly supported UNIFIL, the use of Assembly-funded resolutions to pursue claims against a Member State procedurally was incorrect and inappropriate.  It also politicized the Committee’s work and it should be avoided now and in the future.  That was why the United States had opposed previous Assembly resolutions on the matter, as they required Israel to pay for the costs related to the 1996 Qana incident.
The representative of Canada said his Government continued to support UNIFIL’s valuable work.  But it opposed the resolution because it called on Israel to pay compensation for the 1996 Qana incident, believing that certain paragraphs of the text were inappropriate as they attempted to politicize the Committee’s important work, and weakened the text overall.
The representative of Israel said his country’s political and financial contributions represented its continuing commitment to the operations, goals and values of peacekeeping operations.  He said the text had politicized language that was generally unhelpful in supporting peacekeeping operations. Despite the Committee’s professional nature, the paragraphs voted on were an attempt to institutionalize an anti-Israel narrative in the United Nations.  That was why Israel had called for a recorded vote on the resolution and had opposed it.
The representative of Lebanon thanked all who had voted in favour of financing UNIFIL, particularly the Group of 77, and the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League.  The collective responsibility for peacekeeping operations did not contradict States’ individual responsibility when they violated international law.  States were responsible for the subsequent consequences, including reparations for damages, as called for in the United Nations Charter and in paragraph H, subparagraph 1 of Assembly resolution 55, relating to the scale of assessment.  Israel had not implemented the 18 Assembly resolutions that required it to pay reparations following the Qana bombing, which killed 100 people and injured hundreds.  Israel owed more than $1 million in reparations for material damage after it bombed UNIFIL.  “ Israel has to pay what it owes, as it did, even though not completely, in compensation for damage caused by its bombing of UNRWA centres and schools in Gaza in 2008 and 2009,” he said.
Next, the Assembly adopted by consensus a text on Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) (document A/65/656/Add.1).  [The amount to be appropriated for maintaining the Mission to be announced at a later date.]
The Assembly then adopted a text on financing the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) (document A/65/887), appropriating $61.43 million for MINURSO’s maintenance and deciding that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission, their apportionment shall be set off against their respective share of the unencumbered balance and other income in the total amount of $2.39 million for the period that ended on 30 June 2010.
By a consensus resolution on financing for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) (document A/65/888), the Assembly noted with concern that, as of 20 April 2011, only 79 Member States had paid their assessed contributions to UNAMID in full, and it urge all others, particularly those in arrears, to ensure payment of outstanding contributions.  It decided not to abolish the child protection posts, and asked the Secretary-General to make every effort to fill them.  It further asked the Assembly to identify and abolish an equivalent number of posts at the same level that had been vacant for more than a year to offset the financial impact of retaining the child protection posts. Finally, the Assembly appropriated $1.69 million for UNAMID’s maintenance for the 2011/12 period.
Finally, adopting a consensus text on financing of support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) (document A/65/889) the Assembly appropriated $303.91 million for the maintenance of that entity for the 2011/12 period, as well as invited voluntary contributions for the United Nations Trust Fund established to support AMISOM.

Agrees One-Time Supplemental Payment of $85 Million for Troop-Contributing Countries, Seeks Creation of Advisory Group to Consider Their Reimbursement Rates
In the early hours of the morning today, the General Assembly, acting on the recommendations of its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary), adopted a peacekeeping budget of more than $7 billion for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012.
The budget, which provides for 13 peacekeeping missions and the peacekeeping support account, is broken down as follows:
Mission Amount approved AMISOM (African Union Mission in Somalia) $303.91 million MINURSO ( Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara) $61.43 million MINUSTAH (Stabilization Mission in Haiti) $793.30 million MONUSCO (Organization Stabilization Mission

The text for each Mission sets forth the provisions for apportioning the sums among Member States and specifies any offsets that might apply.
The Assembly adopted all 23 resolutions this morning without a vote, except the text on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which it passed by 117 in favour to 3 against (Canada, Israel, United States), with 1 abstention (Tuvalu).  (For details of the vote, see Annex II.)
Before acting on the UNIFIL text as a whole, the Assembly conducted a separate recorded vote on several paragraphs that referred to previous resolutions calling for Israel to pay $1.1 million for the damages resulting from the 1996 incident at UNIFIL headquarters in Qana, Lebanon.  Those paragraphs were retained by a recorded vote of 70 in favour to 3 against ( Canada, Israel, United States), with 47 abstentions.  (See Annex I.)
Among the consensus resolutions was a text on closed peacekeeping missions, in which the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to return $180 million, or 78.1 per cent, of the $230.74 million net cash available for credit to Member States as of 30 June 2010, based on the scale applicable to each
Mission’s last assessment.  Further to that text, the Assembly decided to consider during the second part of its resumed sixty-sixth session the financial position of closed peacekeeping missions, and asked the Secretary-General to provide it with concrete proposals and alternatives to address outstanding dues owed to Member States from closed peacekeeping missions that are in net cash deficit.
The Assembly also adopted a consensus text on cross-cutting issues, which, among other things, authorized, on an exceptional basis, a one-time supplemental payment of $85 million to troop- contributing countries during the 2011/12 period, without prejudice to the integrity of the process set forth in Assembly resolution 63/285.
Further to that text, the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to create a senior advisory group by October 2011, comprising five eminent persons of relevant experience, five representatives from major troop contributors, five representatives from major financial contributors and one member from each regional group, to consider reimbursement rates for troop-contributing countries and related issues.
Also this morning, the Assembly appointed David Traystman ( United States) as a member of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), to serve from 23 July 2011 to year’s end.
Background
The General Assembly met this morning to take action on resolutions submitted by its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).
Action on Drafts
Opening the meeting, Fifth Committee Rapporteur NICOLE MANNION ( Ireland) introduced that body’s reports.
Taking up the first report, on the appointment of members of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) (document A/65/562/Add.1), the Assembly by consensus appointed David Traystman (United States) as a member of the ACABQ for a term of office beginning on 23 July 2011 and ending on 31 December 2011.
Acting on its first text, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, the resolution on financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors, (document A/65/594/Add. 1).  By that text, the Assembly accepted the audited financial statements of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 and endorsed the recommendations contained in the report of the Board of Auditors.
Next, it adopted, by consensus, a text on estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (document A/65/646/Add.3), by which the Assembly approved the budget of $1.67 million net ($1.69 million gross) for the Panel of Experts on Libya for the period from 1 June to 31 December 2011, and the budget of $1.47 million net ($1.59 million gross) for the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2011.
Turning to the report on administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (document A/65/890), the Assembly took up a draft resolution on cross-cutting issues (draft resolution I), adopting that six-part text without a vote.
The resolution dealt with matters related to financial management, personnel issues, operational requirements for peacekeeping operations, air operations, special measures for protection from sexual exploitation, and the organization’s Global Field Support Strategy.
Among other things, the Assembly paid tribute to all United Nations peacekeepers who had been wounded in the line of duty and asked the Secretary-General to take urgent measures to eliminate the existing backlog of death and disability claims pending for more than three months, and to report on progress made in that regard to the Assembly during the second part of its sixty-sixth session.
Also by the text, the Assembly decided to provide, on an exceptional basis, a one-time
supplemental payment of $85 million to troop-contributing countries during the 2011/12 period, without prejudice to integrity of the process set forth in Assembly resolution 63/285.  Furthermore, the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to establish a senior advisory group by October 2011, consisting of five eminent persons, of relevant experience, five representatives from major troop contributors, five representatives from major contributors and one member from each regional group to consider rates of reimbursement to troop-contributing countries and related issues.
Next, adopting, without a vote, a draft resolution on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations (draft resolution II), the Assembly approved support account requirements in the amount of $351.19 million for the 2011/12 period.  It applied the $3.38 million representing the excess of the authorized level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010 to that resource requirement.  The net estimated staff assessment income of $31.47  million was set off against the balance of $366.21 million, to be prorated among the budgets of the individual active peacekeeping operations.
The Assembly then adopted, again without a vote, a draft resolution on the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi (draft resolution III).
(Amount to be apportioned will be announced at a later date.)
Then, by a text on reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment (draft resolution IV), adopted by consensus, the Assembly endorsed the conclusions and recommendations in the ACABQ report on such procedures (document A/65/830) and asked the Secretary-General to ensure they were implemented.
The Assembly next adopted by consensus a draft on closed peacekeeping missions (draft resolution V), deciding to return to the Government of Kuwait some $70,600, reflecting two thirds of the adjusted net credits available in the account of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission. More broadly, the Assembly asked the Secretary-General to return 78.1 per cent of the $230.74 million net cash available for credit to Member States as at 30 June 2010, in the amount of $180 million, based on the scale applicable to each mission’s last assessment.
Further to that text, the Assembly decided to consider during the second part of its resumed sixty-sixth session the position of closed peacekeeping missions, including remaining sums owed to Member States, after implementing the relevant provisions of this text, determined to have been $50.67 million as of 30 June 2010, under the agenda item entitled “Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations”.  The Assembly asked the Secretary- General to include concrete proposals and alternatives, for its consideration and approval, on how to address outstanding dues owed to Member States from closed peacekeeping missions that are in net cash deficit.
Afterwards, the Assembly adopted a draft on financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) (document A/65/653/Add.1), issued 19 May 2011, by which it deferred until its sixty-sixth session action on the unencumbered balance of $149.95 million and other income and adjustments totalling $13.47 million and an increase of $1.53 million in the estimated staff assessment income.  Further, it asked the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its sixty- sixth session updated information on the cash position of the Mission.
In its preamble, the text recalled that in its latest resolution 1923 (2010) of 25 May 2010, the Security Council extended the mandate of the Mission until 31 December 2010, decided to reduce the military component of the Mission to 2,200 military personnel, and called upon the Secretary-General to complete the withdrawal of all uniformed and civilian components, other than those required for the Mission’s liquidation, by 31 December 2010.
The Assembly then adopted by consensus a text on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) (document A/65/881).
(Amount to be appropriated will be issued at a later date.)
Next, it adopted without a vote a resolution on financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) (document A/65/882).
(Amount to be appropriated will be issued at a later date.)
In a consensus text on the Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC); Financing of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO) (document A/65/654/Add.1), the Assembly recalled Security Council resolution 1925 (2010), by which the Council decided that as of 1 July 2010, the Mission would bear the title of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and be deployed until 30 June 2011.
The Assembly further decided to appropriate $1.42 billion for the 2011/12 period.  States that had fulfilled their obligations to the operation were given an additional offset equal to their respective share of an unencumbered balance of $35.07 million.  It decided that States that had not fulfilled their obligations would have their outstanding obligations offset also by their respective share of that amount, and that the $1.84 million increase in estimated staff assessment income, in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010, would be added to the amounts to be credited to Member States as part of their offset.
In a further provision, the Assembly decided not to abolish the child protection posts, and asked the Secretary-General to make every effort to fill them.  It also asked him to identify and abolish an equivalent number of posts at the same level that had been vacant for more than a year to offset the financial impact of retaining the child protection posts.
Next, the Assembly adopted without a vote a text on the financing of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) (document A/65/883), by which it appropriated $$196.74 million to UNMIT for the 2011/12 period.  States that had fulfilled their obligations to the operation were given an additional offset equal to their respective share of an unencumbered balance of $17.79 million, while States that had not fulfilled their obligations had their outstanding obligations offset by that amount.
The draft further decided to add the increase of $947,800 in estimated staff assessment income, in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010, to the credits from the unencumbered balance of $17.8 million.
In a consensus text on financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) (document A/65/878), the Assembly, recalling in its resolution 1827 (2008) of 30 July 2008 that the Council had terminated the mandate of the Mission effective 31 July 2008, took note of the status of contributions to UNMEE as of 30 April 2011 of credits totalling $2.5 million, as well as included the item in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session.  It also took note of the report of the Secretary- General on the final disposition of UNMEE’s assets and encouraged Member States that are owed credits for the closed peacekeeping mission accounts to apply those credits to any accounts where the Member State concerned has outstanding assessed contributions.
The Assembly then adopted by consensus a draft on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) (document A/65/879), by which it decided that Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to that Mission should be credited with their respective share of the $1.81 million unencumbered balance and other income in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010.  Further, it decided that the respective share of Member States that had not fulfilled their obligations would be offset against their outstanding obligations and that the $157,600 increase in the estimated staff assessment income would be added to the credits from the unencumbered balance.
Adopting a consensus text on financing the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (document A/65/655/Add.1), the Assembly expressed deep concern over MINUSTAH’s continuing high vacancy rate, especially of the national temporary positions, and its negative impact on MINUSTAH’s work.  It asked the Secretary-General to intensify efforts to put into effect measures to mitigate MINUSTAH’s environmental impact, as well as to strengthen coordination among the Mission, the United Nations Country Team and other United Nations entities to address, among other things, the root causes of unexpected emergencies, such as the situation due to the cholera outbreak.  Further, the Assembly appropriated $793.3 million for MINUSTAH’s maintenance.
In a consensus text on financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) (document A/65/884), the Assembly appropriated $44.9 million for UNMIK’s maintenance for the 2011/12 period.
By a draft text on Financing of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) (document A/65/885), also adopted without a vote, the Assembly appropriated $510.07 millionto maintain UNMIL.
Also by its terms, States that had fulfilled their obligations to the operation were given an additional offset equal to their respective share of an unencumbered balance of $32.77 million.  States that had not fulfilled their obligations had their outstanding obligations offset also by their respective share of that amount.  The $361,900 increase in estimated staff assessment income, in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2010, was added to the amounts to be credited to Member States as part of their offset.
By a consensus resolution on financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) (document A/65/886), the Assembly appropriated $49.56 million to maintain UNDOF for the 2011/12 period and it encouraged the Secretary-General to continue taking additional measures to ensure the safety and security of all UNIFIL personnel working under United Nations auspices.
Next, the Assembly adopted by a recorded vote of 117 in favour to 3 against ( Canada, Israel, United States), with 1 abstention ( Tuvalu), a text on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (document A/65/880).  (For details of the vote, see Annex II.)  By its terms, the Assembly appropriated $545.47 million to maintain UNIFIL during the 2011/12 period.
Before voting on the resolution as a whole, the Assembly held a single, separate vote on several paragraphs referring to previous resolutions calling for Israel to pay $1.1 million for the damages resulting from the 1996 incident at UNIFIL headquarters in Qana, Lebanon.  Those paragraphs were retained by a recorded vote of 70 in favour to 3 against ( Canada, Israel, United States), with 47 abstentions.  (See Annex I.)
Also by the text, for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, their apportionment would be offset by their respective share of the unencumbered balance and other income accumulated in the financial period ended 30 June 2010 ($62.95 million).  For those that had not fulfilled their financial obligations, their outstanding contribution would be offset by their respective share of the same.  An increase of $1.1 million in the estimated staff assessment income would be added to the credits from the unencumbered balance.
Further to the draft, the Assembly took note of $59.5 million in outstanding contributions as of 30 April 2011, and it noted with concern that only 91 Member States had paid their assessed contributions in full.  It expressed concern over the financial situation of reimbursing troop contributors that bore additional burdens due to overdue staff assessment payments by Member States, and concern over the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, especially in Africa.
Speaking in explanation of vote, the representative of Syria said he had joined the consensus on the resolutions related to financing of UNDOF and UNIFIL.  Israel, which was the occupier, aggressor and the reason for having to create the missions, should be responsible for their financing.  He agreed with the principles set forth in Assembly resolution 1874 (1963).
The representative of the United States said that, while his country strongly supported UNIFIL, the use of Assembly-funded resolutions to pursue claims against a Member State procedurally was incorrect and inappropriate.  It also politicized the Committee’s work and it should be avoided now and in the future.  That was why the United States had opposed previous Assembly resolutions on the matter, as they required Israel to pay for the costs related to the 1996 Qana incident.
The representative of Canada said his Government continued to support UNIFIL’s valuable work.  But it opposed the resolution because it called on Israel to pay compensation for the 1996 Qana incident, believing that certain paragraphs of the text were inappropriate as they attempted to politicize the Committee’s important work, and weakened the text overall.
The representative of Israel said his country’s political and financial contributions represented its continuing commitment to the operations, goals and values of peacekeeping operations.  He said the text had politicized language that was generally unhelpful in supporting peacekeeping operations. Despite the Committee’s professional nature, the paragraphs voted on were an attempt to institutionalize an anti-Israel narrative in the United Nations.  That was why Israel had called for a recorded vote on the resolution and had opposed it.
The representative of Lebanon thanked all who had voted in favour of financing UNIFIL, particularly the Group of 77, and the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League.  The collective responsibility for peacekeeping operations did not contradict States’ individual responsibility when they violated international law.  States were responsible for the subsequent consequences, including reparations for damages, as called for in the United Nations Charter and in paragraph H, subparagraph 1 of Assembly resolution 55, relating to the scale of assessment.  Israel had not implemented the 18 Assembly resolutions that required it to pay reparations following the Qana bombing, which killed 100 people and injured hundreds.  Israel owed more than $1 million in reparations for material damage after it bombed UNIFIL.  “ Israel has to pay what it owes, as it did, even though not completely, in compensation for damage caused by its bombing of UNRWA centres and schools in Gaza in 2008 and 2009,” he said.
Next, the Assembly adopted by consensus a text on Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) (document A/65/656/Add.1).  [The amount to be appropriated for maintaining the Mission to be announced at a later date.]
The Assembly then adopted a text on financing the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) (document A/65/887), appropriating $61.43 million for MINURSO’s maintenance and deciding that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission, their apportionment shall be set off against their respective share of the unencumbered balance and other income in the total amount of $2.39 million for the period that ended on 30 June 2010.
By a consensus resolution on financing for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) (document A/65/888), the Assembly noted with concern that, as of 20 April 2011, only 79 Member States had paid their assessed contributions to UNAMID in full, and it urge all others, particularly those in arrears, to ensure payment of outstanding contributions.  It decided not to abolish the child protection posts, and asked the Secretary-General to make every effort to fill them.  It further asked the Assembly to identify and abolish an equivalent number of posts at the same level that had been vacant for more than a year to offset the financial impact of retaining the child protection posts. Finally, the Assembly appropriated $1.69 million for UNAMID’s maintenance for the 2011/12 period.
Finally, adopting a consensus text on financing of support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) (document A/65/889) the Assembly appropriated $303.91 million for the maintenance of that entity for the 2011/12 period, as well as invited voluntary contributions for the United Nations Trust Fund established to support AMISOM.
