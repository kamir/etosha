Letter dated 12 August 2009 from the Chairman of the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict addressed to the Secretary-General
On 19 December 2008, the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, established by Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), examined the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (S/2008/693). Following its meeting on 1 July 2009, the Working Group adopted its conclusions on the parties to the armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (S/AC.51/2009/3). In follow-up to the recommendations of the Working Group, approved by the Security Council, and subject to and consistent with applicable international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 1612 (2005), I am entrusted, in my capacity as the Chairman of the Working Group, to remind you of the mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to protect children as defined in Security Council resolution 1856 (2008); and to request you, with regard to the ongoing review of the MONUC mission, structure, civilian activities and deployment pursuant to that resolution, to continue to include adequate child protection capacity to implement resolution 1612 (2005). I welcome the initiatives taken by MONUC in partnership with UNICEF to improve child protection, raise awareness and change behaviours regarding violations and abuses committed against children, inter alia, (a) the establishment with the Mixed Commission on Peace and Security of a process to provide assistance and facilitate the release of children under the Amani programme; (b) the launch of regional child protection working groups bringing together in one forum child protection actors and partners; (c) the development of an accelerated common action plan to combat sexual and gender-based violence and the appointment of a senior adviser and coordinator on sexual violence; and (d) the provision of technical support, advice and training to military prosecutors and military judicial police inspectors in the field of investigation and prosecution of grave violations and abuses committed against children. I invite you to request the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and other relevant United Nations entities, within their respective mandates and approved resources and in close cooperation with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to continue to address socio-economic issues as a matter of priority, to contribute to addressing the welfare of children affected by armed conflict by, inter alia, providing assistance to improve the implementation of rehabilitation and reintegration programmes, and to strengthen the education system, including in conflict-affected areas; as well as to consider addressing the long-term effects of armed conflict on children by supporting the development of a health-care system to facilitate their full recovery, including adequate attention to psychological care for all children affected by armed conflict, and access to sexual and reproductive health services, in particular for victims of sexual violence. Finally, I also remind you of the request in Security Council resolution 1857 (2008) that MONUC share information with the Group of Experts established
