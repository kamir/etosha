The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President U. Joy Ogwu ( Nigeria):
The members of the Security Council were briefed by Roger Meece, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the preparation of the forthcoming elections in the country.
The members of the Security Council reiterated their call for credible and peaceful elections, for which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bears the primary responsibility.  They recalled the importance of free and constructive political debate, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, equitable access to media, including State media, and safety for all candidates, as well as for election observers and witnesses, journalists, human rights defenders and actors from the civil society including women.
They stressed the need for the Commission électorale nationale indépendante (CENI) to ensure enhanced and regular dialogue with all candidates in order to ensure a peaceful process before, during and after the elections.  They encouraged CENI to address in particular the technical issues perceived as key to the elections’ credibility, including the reliability of the electoral database and the compilation of election results.  They welcomed the initiative of the CENI to put in place a National Mediation Committee to solve disputes between all stakeholders.  They strongly encouraged all Congolese parties to sign and respect the electoral code of conduct elaborated by the CENI and to participate in a constructive and peaceful manner in the entire electoral process, including after the elections.  The members of the Security Council expressed concern over reports of election-related violence on the streets of Kinshasa, and called upon all parties to campaign peacefully.
The members of the Security Council welcomed the current and planned deployment of international, regional and national observers, and the efforts of Congolese political parties, civil society and religious leaders to ensure national ownership of the electoral process.
The members of the Security Council called upon MONUSCO [United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo] to continue to support the organization and conduct of the forthcoming elections, as set out in resolution 1991 (2011).  They encouraged in particular the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and MONUSCO to continue their dialogue with the CENI, including through the Election Partnership Committee, and to support enhanced dialogue between the CENI and all Congolese stakeholders, in particular through the Political Parties’ Forum.  They recalled their request to be regularly and timely briefed on the significant events of the electoral process and on MONUSCO’s support to the process.
