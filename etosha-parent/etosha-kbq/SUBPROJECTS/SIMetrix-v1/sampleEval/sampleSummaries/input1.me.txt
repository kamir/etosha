Maurice Clemmons, the man who killed four Lakewood police officers on Sunday, was the subject of at least one investigation by drug enforcement authorities since he moved to Washington state in 2004. 
And yet even as Maurice Clemmons announced he had gunned down police officers in a Pierce County coffeehouse Sunday, a network of friends and family stood by him, helping him hide from a massive manhunt that had hundreds of officers scouring two counties, according to charging documents. 
A 38-year-old man convicted of a double-murder at a liquor store in Arkansas in 1990 is being investigated as the getaway driver in Sunday's slaying of four Lakewood police officers, according to Pierce County authorities. 
Authorities are trying to determine the source of a photo of alleged cop-killer Maurice Clemmons taken after he was fatally shot by a Seattle police officer Tuesday morning.
