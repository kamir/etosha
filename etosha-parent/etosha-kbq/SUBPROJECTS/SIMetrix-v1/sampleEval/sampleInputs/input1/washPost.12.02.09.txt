Suspect in slaying of officers is killed.

SEATTLE -- The man suspected of gunning down four police officers in a suburban Tacoma, Wash., coffee shop was shot and killed by a lone patrolman early Tuesday. Several people accused of helping the suspect elude authorities during a massive two-day manhunt were arrested.

Maurice Clemmons was carrying a handgun he took from one of the dead officers when a Seattle police officer recognized him in a working-class neighborhood about 2:45 a.m., Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel said.

The officer had pulled up to a vehicle that was running but unoccupied, and after radioing in the license plate number, he realized the car was stolen, Pugel said.

The officer saw something moving, got out of his car, saw Clemmons, and ordered him to show his hands and stop.

"He wouldn't stop," Pugel said. "The officer fired several rounds." Clemmons also had suffered a serious gunshot wound from one of the four officers killed in the coffee-shop slaying.

Police arrested four people accused of helping Clemmons and planned to take two or three more into custody Tuesday.

"Some are friends. Some are acquaintances. Some are partners in crime. Some are relatives. Now they're all partners in crime," said Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County sheriff's office. 

Authorities said Clemmons, 37, singled out the Lakewood, Wash., officers in Sunday morning's shooting and spared employees and other customers at the coffee shop. He then fled, but not before one of the dying officers shot him in the torso.

Killed were Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39, and Officers Ronald Owens, 37, Tina Griswold, 40, and Greg Richards, 42.

Police said they aren't sure what prompted Clemmons to shoot the four officers, who were in uniform and working on paperwork at the coffee shop two blocks outside their jurisdiction.

"The only motive that we have is he decided he was going to go kill police officers," Troyer said.
