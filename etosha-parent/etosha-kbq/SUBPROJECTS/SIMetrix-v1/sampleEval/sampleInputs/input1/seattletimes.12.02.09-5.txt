Maurice Clemmons' alleged accomplice used an alias.

PARKLAND, Pierce County . Randy Huey . the real one . was "sickened and shocked" when he turned on the news Tuesday night and learned he was being called an accomplice to alleged cop-killer Maurice Clemmons.

"I heard the reporter saying my name and it was a sickening feeling. I am not that guy and I would never do anything like that," said Huey, 43, of Parkland.

Huey's name was used as an alias by Darcus D. Allen, the man police and prosecutors describe as the getaway driver for Clemmons, who allegedly killed four Lakewood police officers Sunday morning. Huey's name was contained in court documents and released by police, and picked up by KIRO-TV and seattlepi.com.

Huey knew both Clemmons and Allen.

Huey met Clemmons, who lived around the corner from him, about a year and a half ago. The two became friendly and Huey hired Clemmons and his landscaping team to do some yard work.

Allen was one of the men employed by Clemmons. Huey knew him casually.

Huey has since learned that Allen appropriated his name some time ago.

When Allen was taken into custody by police this week, he told them his name was Huey, police said.

Huey said detectives came to his home, showed one of his sons a photo of Allen and asked, "Is this your dad?"

Chris Grygiel, a news gatherer for seattlepi.com., said the Web site got Huey's name from police.

Detective Ed Troyer of the Pierce County Sheriff's Office said Huey has no connection to the officers' slayings.

"It's very upsetting and hurtful that he used my name," Huey said of Allen. "I'm known in this community and I don't believe in violence or guns."
