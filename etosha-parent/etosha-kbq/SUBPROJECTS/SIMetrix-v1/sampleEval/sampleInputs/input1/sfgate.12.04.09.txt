Another arrest in Washington police shooting case.

Two women were charged Friday with helping the man accused of killing four Washington state police officers, and his sister was arrested at the women's court hearing.

Maurice Clemmons' aunt, Letricia Nelson, was charged with six counts of first-degree rendering criminal assistance, and one count of possession of a stolen firearm.

Clemmons' friend, Quiana Williams, was charged with five counts of first-degree rendering criminal assistance. Both pleaded not guilty. Nelson is being held on $1.5 million bail; Williams' bail is $1 million.

Pierce County prosecutors said the women provided transportation, medical supplies and treatment to Clemmons after he killed four Lakewood police officers Sunday morning at a coffee shop.

Latanya Clemmons, sister of Maurice Clemmons, was being interviewed by detectives, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. Prosecutors would decide what, if any, charges to bring against her, he said.

Clemmons was shot to death early Tuesday by a Seattle police officer after a two-day manhunt. Latanya Clemmons was the seventh person arrested in the case being built against those accused of helping him elude capture.

Authorities said Clemmons singled out the Lakewood officers and spared employees and other customers at the coffee shop in Parkland, a Tacoma suburb about 35 miles south of Seattle. He then fled, but not before he was shot in the torso by one of the dying officers. Prosecutors said he received help from a network of family and friends.

Killed were Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39, and Officers Ronald Owens, 37, Tina Griswold, 40, and Greg Richards, 42.

A public memorial service for the officers is planned for Tuesday at the Tacoma Dome.
