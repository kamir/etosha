Authorities investigate who leaked photo of Clemmons' body.

Authorities are trying to determine the source of a photo of alleged cop-killer Maurice Clemmons taken after he was fatally shot by a Seattle police officer Tuesday morning.

The photo shows Clemmons lying on a gurney and appears to have been taken inside an ambulance. At least two gunshot wounds are visible.

The photo reportedly was sent to a Seattle radio station and is circulating on the Internet.

Seattle's police and fire departments as well as the King County Medical Examiner's Office have each launched internal investigations to determine the origin of the photo, according to a joint statement issued Wednesday.

While it isn't illegal for a photo to be taken at a crime scene, police spokeswoman Renee Witt said that if the image was leaked to the media by a member of either agency, or someone else acting in an official capacity at the crime scene, they could face discipline from their employer.

"We don't even know where it came from or who took it," Witt said. "We have to launch our own investigation. Is it legitimate first and foremost, and who took the image?"

Clemmons was fatally shot at about 2:45 a.m. Tuesday by Seattle police officer Benjamin Kelly in the 4400 block of South Kenyon Street, ending a manhunt that began Sunday morning after four Lakewood police officers were killed in Pierce County.
